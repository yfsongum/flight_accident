Tambo International Airport (JNB/FAOR)","Venetia Mine Airport (FAVM)"," CAA S.A.","Accident investigation report completed and information captured","A SA Airlink Jetstream 41 aircraft departed Johannesburg International Airport on a commercial flight to Venetia Mine Airport. After takeoff the aircraft climbed to the cruising altitude flight level 210 (FL210) in accordance with the flight plan. During the descent to Venetia Mine, the first officer made a radio call to the aerodrome inspector on the VHF radio to inform him that they would be landing shortly. Thereafter, the aerodrome inspector went to perform a runway inspection. Once complete, the aerodrome inspector informed the flight that he had completed the runway inspection and that it was clear of foreign object debris and no wildlife was spotted close to the runway.  The crew stated that touchdown was normal on runway 08, however, during the landing roll at a ground speed of approximately 104 knots, with the propellers in the reverse thrust configuration (course pitch), a large bird (Kori Bustard) got airborne from the grass area next to the runway on the right side. The bird impacted the no.2 (right-side) propeller and one of the blades was severed. Some fragments from the blade penetrated the fuselage (third row of seats).  According to the crew, the bird strike caused the aircraft to shake and the number 2 engine to show an over temperature indication. The Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT) indication was over 750Â°C. The crew followed the engine shut down procedure while bringing the aircraft to a stop on the runway. After the aircraft had stopped, the captain, through the intercom, spoke with the passengers to check if they were harmed. The cabin crew member reported that nobody was injured after checking with the passengers. The crew then taxied the aircraft to the apron with only the left engine in operation. Once the engine was shut down, the passengers disembarked the aircraft. The aircraft sustained substantial damage. Probable Cause A bird strike on the propeller blade caused the overload fracture and separation failure of the blade. Contributory Factors: 1. Inadequate control of wildlife at the airfield. 2. Inadequate number of trained personnel to monitor and deter possible wildlife during aircraft operations.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CAA S.A.

About 11:48 local time JetBlueâs 1748 flight crew announced on the common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF) that they were leaving the ramp area to taxi to runway 10 for departure. A few seconds later, a Beechcraft B300 King Air, N350J, on an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan reported on the local CTAF that they were ""about 9 minutes out, for ten, coming in from the east, descending out of 17,000 ft"". The UNICOM operator at HDN responded to N350J stating that there were ""multiple aircraft inbound"" and winds were calm and provided the altimeter setting. After this exchange, the JetBlue crew began discussing the active runway and the multiple inbound airplanes using runway 10. About the time the JetBlue flight crew was starting their second engine and conducting engine checks, the King Air flight crew was contacting Denver ARTCC to cancel their IFR flight plan because they had visually acquired HDN and intended to land on runway 28. The Denver ARTCC controller acknowledged the IFR cancellation. The King Airâs flight crew subsequently announced, about 11:53 on CTAF that they were ""going to go ahead and land two eight"" and were ""straight-in two eight right now"". About 10 seconds later, the JetBlue flight crew announced on CTAF they were leaving the ramp area and were taxiing to runway 10 for departure. HDN UNICOM reported that multiple airplanes were inbound, and the winds were calm. While the JetBlue flight crew was performing an after-start checklist, the King Air announced on CTAF they were on a ""12-mile final two eight straight-in"". About 45 seconds later, the King Air asked on CTAF if anyone was about to depart from runway 10, and the JetBlue flight crew replied that they intended to hold on the taxiway near the end of runway 10 and wait for a clearance from Denver ARTCC. The King Air replied they were on a ""10-mile final, two eight, straight-in"". The JetBlue flight crew said ""alright, copy"" and that they would keep an eye out for them. About 11:55, the JetBlue flight crew received clearance to their destination after reporting to Denver ARTCC that they were ready for departure on runway 10 at HDN.  The JetBlue flight crew then announced on CTAF that they had received their clearance and would be departing on ""runway one zero"". Within 5 seconds, the King Airâs flight crew reported they ""had a king air on final two eight"" and that they ""had been calling."" JetBlueâs flight crew replied on CTAF that they thought the King Air was ""8 or 9 miles out"", to which the King Air replied they were 4 miles out, ""even less than that."" The JetBlue first officer, (pilot monitoring (PM)) stated that they looked for the airplane both visually and on their onboard traffic alert and collision avoidance system (TCAS) and did not see any air traffic. JetBlue flight crew acknowledged the King Air, looked for traffic approaching runway 10, and announced on CTAF that they were beginning their takeoff from runway 10 at HDN. The King Airâs flight crew replied that they were on a short final and ""I hope you donât hit us.""  According to ADS-B data, when JetBlue taxied onto runway 10 the King Air was on a reciprocal course 4.91 nautical miles from JetBlue. JetBlueâs crew increased thrust for takeoff about 11:57. About 11 seconds later, just prior to the 80 knots call out, the PM asked the PF if the King Air was on runway 28. The captain (pilot flying (PF)) asked ""is he?"" to which the PM said ""Yes, he is on 28, do you see him?"" to which the PF said no.  About 20 seconds after JetBlue started their take off on runway 10, the flight crew of the King Air asked JetBlue if they were going to do a quick turn-out, to which they replied, ""yes sir."" Concurrent to this conversation, JetBlueâs captain pitched the airplane up, 24 knots before rotation speed, to avoid the approaching King Air and subsequently struck the tail of the airplane on the runwayâs surface. He began a climbing right turn away from the traffic indicated on the TCAS. JetBlueâs captain and first officer both stated they never visually acquired the approaching King Air. According to ADS-B data, when JetBlue began its right turn after departure from runway 10 the King Air was on a reciprocal course with 2.27 nautical miles of separation between the converging airplanes.  While climbing to their cruising altitude, the flight crew discussed what had happened and consulted a jetBlue maintenance controller on their tailstrike. It was decided to divert to Denver for damage assessment.  The flight safely landed at Denver at 12:42 hours. Probable Cause: The captainâs rotation of the airplane pitch before the rotation speed on takeoff due to his surprise about encountering head on landing traffic, which resulted in an exceedance of the airplaneâs pitch limit and a subsequent tail strike. Contributing to the accident was the flight crewâs expectation bias that the incoming aircraft was landing on the same runway as they were departing from, and the conflicting trafficâs nonstandard use of phraseology when making position calls on the common traffic advisory frequency.METAR: 17:56 UTC / 10:56 local time: KHDN 221756Z AUTO 21005KT 8SM -SN FEW003 M11/M14 A3037 RMK AO2 SNB11 SLP364 P0000 60000 T11061144 11072 21144 51008 FZRANO19:23 UTC / 12:23 local time: KHDN 221923Z AUTO 19003KT 10SM BKN003 M06/M14 A3035 RMK AO2 FZRANOAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA22LA069 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Flightaware   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Control was lost during an attempted landing in a strong crosswind, following an ILS approach. The left wingtip struck the runway several times and remained in contact with the ground as the aircraft departed the paved surface into the grass area at the side of the runway. The aircraftâs stick pusher also activated, resulting in a hard landing that damaged the aircraftâs nose landing gear assembly. The flight then diverted to London-Gatwick Airport, where it landed at 00:51 UTC. Conclusion The aircraft yawed and rolled rapidly following a long float with insufficient airspeed in strong gusting wind conditions. Stick shaker activation was followed almost immediately by stick pusher activation, resulting in the aircraft landing on its nosewheel. A crosswind exceeding the commanderâs personal limit was forecast before departure. It would have been possible to delay departure or select an alternative arrival aerodrome with more favourable conditions.  The commander reflected that although there was an opportunity to discontinue the approach earlier, he had felt compelled to continue with the landing by a degree of plan continuation bias. Fatigue, commercial pressure and the nature of their interactions may have made the pilots more susceptible to this bias.METAR: 00:20 UTC / 00:20 local time: EGSS 310020Z AUTO 30013G24KT 9999 NCD 07/03 Q101600:50 UTC / 00:50 local time: EGSS 310050Z AUTO 29012KT 260V320 9999 NCD 07/02 Q101623:50 UTC / 23:50 local time: EGSS 302350Z AUTO 29013KT 250V330 9999 -RA SCT014/// SCT021/// BKN039/// //////TCU 07/04 Q1016Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: AAIB-27993 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Flightaware track  NTSB  Salvage tender   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft was operated on a mission that consisted of a multi-day cross country training and familiarization trip with three military aircrew members onboard. The accident happened on the first segment of the mission. The crew was cleared for the RNAV Z 25 instrument approach into the Thunder Bay Airport. The weather consisted of light winds and good visibility, with a ceiling at 2200 ft AGL. The approach proceeded normally and as the aircraft crossed through 600 ft AGL, the Pilot Flying elected to disconnect the autopilot and continue under manual control. Shortly after the aircraft crossed over the threshold of runway 25, the flying pilot reduced the two power levers to the idle position for landing. The aircraft experienced a yaw to the left and a significant drop of the left wing. The crew initiated an overshoot, however the aircraft continued to descend and the left wing impacted the runway surface. The aircraft progressed off the runway onto the snow-covered infield. After the aircraft came to rest, the crew conducted an emergency shut down and exited the aircraft.METAR: 16:00 UTC / 11:00 local time: CYQT 311600Z 20002KT 20SM OVC022 M11/M13 A2991 RMK SC8 SLP15017:26 UTC / 12:26 local time: CYQT 311726Z VRB02KT 20SM OVC022 M08/M10 A2989 RMK SC8 SLP140 Sources: tbnewswatch.com  flightaware.com  RCAF   Location  Images: photo (c) RCAF; Thunder Bay Airport, ON (YQT); 31 January 2022 photo (c) RCAF; Thunder Bay Airport, ON (YQT); 31 January 2022 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot of the PC-12 stated to the NTSB that after the pilot-rated passenger joined him in completing the cockpit checklist, they prepared for engine start with the airplaneÂs parking brake applied. While pushing on the toe brakes he pushed the starter switch and verified that the oil pressure was rising, and the compressor turbine (Ng) had increased to 13%. At 13%, he noted the temperature of the engine oil, and moved the condition lever to flight idle per the checklist. He observed Ng increase to 40% and felt the airplane ""lurching forward."" He pressed harder on the toe brakes, but the airplane continued forward, while the engine spooled-up. The airplane was fast approaching the parked, unoccupied Hawker 1000 airplane.

Conclusion: Most probably, the accident with the AN-2 RA-33599 aircraft occurred as a result of it reaching overcritical angles of attack and stall mode after performing takeoff with the maximum permissible weight and reduced power of the power plant. Most probably, the reduced power was caused by setting the PM-1 magneto switch to position ""1"" before takeoff instead of position ""1+2"" as stipulated by the flight manual. The most likely contributing factors were: - long flight interruptions by both crew members prior to the emergency flight; - shortcomings in training and interaction of crew members, as well as insufficient flight training, which resulted in loss of control over flight speed.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: life.ru  EMERCOM Russia   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane was operated as an instructional flight. The pilot had recently retired from flying large category transport airplanes. He was recently hired Air Flamenco and had received some ground school training on the BN-2A-9, the company mission, routes, and destinations. The accident occurred on the first landing of his first flight, and it was his first ever landing at the accident airport.

The approach was flown about 80 knots and about 100 ft above the normal flight path, the stated to the NTSB. After touchdown the airplane ""leaned to the right"" and veered off the right side of the runway. The commercial pilot seated in the back stated it was not a hard landing, but it was ""harder than anything he had experienced before at that airport."" The right-hand wing was partially severed at the wing root and the airplane came to a stop in the grass on the left side of the runway. The right propeller blades displayed tip curling and the orange-painted wingtip displayed impact damage and longitudinal scraping and asphalt transfer. Probable Cause: The flight crewÂs failure to arrest the descent rate during the non-standard approach, which resulted in a hard landing and failure of the right-wing structure.

The first leg was uneventful. The controller cleared the flight to back track on runway 06/24 to the threshold of runway 06 for takeoff. After having taxied about 200 m, the right engine apparently experienced a substantial periodic acceleration to a taxi speed of 36 knots, where a maximum speed of 10 knots is allowed by the manufacturer. After the right engine accelerated, there was a trajectory change to the left side of the runway centerline. The crew attempted to keep the aircraft within the runway, however, the crew's efforts did not have a positive result, allowing the aircraft to drift out of the runway into the safety zone. When the aircraft was over the safety zone, the crew attempted to use the braking system, however, the brakes were not effective due to the poor traction of the aircraft's wheels with the grass surface in the safety zone.  The aircraft continued to taxi to the left of the runway, until coming to a complete stop when the nose of the aircraft collided with a concrete wall bordering the airport.  The aircraft suffered substantial damage in the nose area, however, the stress concentration due to the impact was more evident in the left front fuselage area, structurally compromising a large part of the skin. Probable Cause Runway excursion, as a result of loss of directional control of the aircraft, when exceeding the maximum taxi speed allowed by the aircraft manufacturer. Contributing Factors Possible misuse of the nose wheel steering control system, nose wheel steering, by the crew when using it above the allowed speed, hindering directional control. Lack of standardization of the company's operating procedures, as it lacks its own taxiing policies and procedures. Probable self-imposed pressure from the crew, due to their desire to comply with the scheduled operation. Overconfidence, complacency, loss of situational awareness, and inadequate application of CRM by the crew, during a normal operation of the aircraft, which was apparently free of hazards.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Aerocivil Report number: COL-22-10-DIACC Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: Aerocivil   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were no injuries. According to the captain's statement to the NTSB, before departure, the airplane and runway were clear of any contaminants, all pre-takeoff checks were normal, and the flaps were set to 15Â°. During the takeoff clearance for runway 33, the air traffic control tower reported the wind was from 160Â° at 16 knots, gusting to 25 knots, and the instantaneous wind was from 180Â° at 10 knots. The captain performed a static takeoff, and the first officer made all of the callouts; airspeed alive, 80 knots, V1, and rotate. At rotation speed, the captain applied back pressure on the yoke; however, the airplane would not become airborne. The captain reported, ""the yoke did not have any air resistance or any pressure on it as we experience normally in Hawkers."" After a few seconds and without any indication the airplane would take off, the captain aborted the takeoff. The captain reduced the engines to idle, deployed the thrust reversers, and applied the brakes. The airplane subsequently departed the end of the runway into the snow.  Aspen Airport is located in a high mountain valley with mountainous terrain from 12500-14000 feet msl in near proximity to the airport. Instrument departures demand takeoff from runway 33 due to surrounding terrain. As N99AP was cleared for takeoff, ATC reported winds from 160 degrees at 16 knots, gusting to 25 knots. The Takeoff Runway Available (TORA) is 8006 feet (2440 m). Probable Cause and Findings The flight crewâs decision to takeoff in tailwind conditions that were consistently above the airplaneâs tailwind limitation, which resulted in a runway overrun following an aborted takeoff.  Contributing was the flight crewâs use of the instantaneous wind report for the decision to attempt the takeoff.METAR: 18:53 UTC / 11:53 local time: KASE 211853Z 16016G25KT 10SM FEW036 BKN060 01/M09 A2961 RMK AO2 PK WND 17027/1841 SLP988 T00111094Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN22LA130 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: www.aspentimes.com  www.aspendailynews.com  https://www.underwriterssalvagecompany.com/Listing/Details/733725/1999-Raytheon-Hawker-800-XP  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates01-Jul-2024 08:51 ASN Updated [Narrative, Accident report, ]08-Jul-2024 12:57 ASN Updated [Source, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot and passenger were seriously injured.  The pilot stated that the pilot-rated passenger was spending the day observing the skydiving operation. He had made three consecutive flights climbing to around 13,000 feet mean sea level (msl) to unload the skydivers. On the fourth flight, the pilot departed runway 25 and made a gradual climb to 12,700 ft msl as he circled back to the airport. The skydivers departed the airplane and the pilot initiated a steep, turning descent with the power at idle. He stated that the airplane was in âbeta modeâ but that the power lever was above the flight idle gate and the speed lever was left in the high position. The pilot stated that, while the airplane was on the base leg of the traffic pattern to runway 25, at an altitude about 4,000 ft msl and a descent rate of 4,500 fpm, he attempted to arrest the descent by adding power. The pilot further stated that despite his attempt to add power, the engine did not respond to movements of the power lever. He moved the propeller speed lever, which also had no effect. The pilot presumed that the engine had flamed out and attempted a restart. With the propeller still windmilling, he switched the ignition to âcontinuousâ and turned the boost pump on. He observed the torque gauge increase from 0% to 20%, but the engine was still unresponsive to movements of the power lever. He applied full nose-up trim and pulled the control yoke full aft against the stop, but the airplane would not maintain a level attitude. With the airplane in a noselow attitude, it collided with terrain about 1,400 ft short of the runway below). The pilot did not feather the propeller.  Probable Cause The pilotâs intentional inflight operation of the propeller in beta, which led to an aerodynamic lock, his inability to restore forward thrust, and subsequent collision with terrain.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: WPR22LA114 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: sandiegouniontribune.com  nbcsandiego.com History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  17 August 2008 F-OIJO Tropic Airlines 0 Saint BarthÃ©lÃ©my, French Antilles non Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates31-May-2024 07:30 ASN Updated [Aircraft type, Narrative, Accident report, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot and passenger were not injured. The pilot reported that he started the day at San Marcos Regional Airport (HYI) and flew east toward Houston for a survey. This flight lasted about 1 hour 10 minutes. He then flew 1 hour southeast and started a second survey. After about 3 hours of total flight time, he proceeded to Pleasanton Municipal Airport (PEZ) to get fuel. During the descent, the ""left fuel low"" light illuminated, and shortly thereafter the ""reservoir fuel low"" light illuminated. The pilot ensured the fuel tanks, fuel pump, and igniters were on, and he diverted to a nearby private strip. Soon after, the airplaneÂs engine began to lose power. The pilot increased the throttle, but the engine lost total power. The airplane descended rapidly when it struck several trees and touched down on an upsloping field short of the runway. The wing spar in the airplaneÂs right wing sustained substantial damage. Probable Cause: The pilot's fuel mismanagement, which resulted in a total loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion and subsequent impact with trees during a forced landing.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN22LA134 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  22 January 1998 C-FAFV Alta Flights (Charters) Inc. 0 Edmonton International Airport, AB (YEG/CYEG) sub Loss of control 4 March 2019 C-FAFV Amik Aviation 0 1,4 km S of Little Grand Rapids Airport, MB (ZGR) sub Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight crew reported they flew a normal flight and a stabilized approach in gusty wind conditions. Performance data indicated they would require about 3,000 ft of runway for landing on the 6,995 ft long runway, and they added 5 knots (kts) to the approach speed due to the gusts. Data indicated that the airplane landed in the touchdown zone and at an appropriate airspeed of 110 kts (104 kts groundspeed); however, the pilot's and co-pilot's application of brakes was unsuccessful in achieving sufficient braking action. The airplane departed the runway at a groundspeed of 58 kts and came to rest against a perimeter fence 450 ft past the runway. A witness stated the airplane landed long; however, his distance from the runway and his angle of view of the airplane may have prevented an accurate assessment.  Although the airplane flight manual states that if the brake system or antiskid fails, the pilot(s) are to attempt to pull the emergency brake, the pilots were unable to locate the emergency brake and instead pulled the parking brake. Although an examination of the braking system failed to find an anomaly, a performance study revealed that during the ground rollout the deceleration was primarily due to aerodynamic drag and free rolling 'unbraked' wheel friction for about 5,000 ft and that there was virtually no evidence of deceleration due to hydraulic or pneumatic wheel braking during the rollout. However, the pilots' inability to locate and use the emergency brake contributed to the insufficient braking. The crew failed to immediately recognize the issue and locate and utilize the emergency brake for supplemental braking authority. Probable Cause: And undetermined failure of the brake system. Contributing to the accident was the failure of the pilots to locate and operate the emergency brake control, which resulted in a runway excursion and collision with terrain and an object.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA22LA148 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources: www.wlox.com  FAA   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates04-Apr-2024 08:35 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The occupants suffered minor injuries. The aircraft was en route to an ice strip on Springpole Lake, Ontario. At 12:50, a snow squall began to move across CYXL, reducing ground visibility. The pilot taxied the aircraft to a position on the apron and waited for the fast-moving snow squall to pass. At 13:01, the pilot taxied the aircraft to runway 34 and took off in visual meteorological conditions. The aircraft climbed to approximately 1800 feet above sea level (ASL), then, once clear of the control zone, it descended to approximately 1600 to 1700 feet ASL, roughly 500 to 600 feet above ground level (AGL), to remain below the overcast ceiling. As the aircraft began to cross Lac Seul, Ontario, the visibility straight ahead and to the west was good. However, when the aircraft was roughly midway across the lake, it encountered turbulence and immediately became enveloped in whiteout conditions generated by a snow squall. The pilot turned his head to inspect the left wing and saw that ice appeared to be accumulating on the leading edge. He turned his attention back to the flight instruments and saw that the altimeter was descending rapidly. He then pulled back on the control column to stop the descent; however, within a few seconds, the aircraft struck the frozen surface of Lac Seul.

The pilot suffered fatal injuries. On 29 March 2022, the day before the accident, the pilot was flying the Cessna 208, registered as D-FLIC, from Costa dâArgento Airfield in Italy to the Siegerland Airport (EDSG) for maintenance. He flew over the SÃ¤ntis massif under visual flight rules at an altitude of approximately 8200 ft AMSL and on the same route as on the day of the accident, namely on the direct connecting line between the waypoints PELAD and DEGES provided for flights under instrument flight rules. On 30 March 2022 at 09:02 UTC, the pilot took off in the Cessna 208 from EDSG on a visual flight to the airport Arezzo (LIQB) in Italy. At 10:19 UTC, he passed the waypoint DEGES at 5400 ft AMSL. He was in radio contact with FIC Zurich, which had instructed him to remain under the Zurich terminal area (TMA). This airspace has a lower limit of 7500 ft AMSL at DEGES. After passing DEGES, the pilot flew as planned in the direction of waypoint PELAD and at 10:19:31 UTC the FIC informed him that the maximum permitted altitude for visual flights without authorisation to enter controlled airspace was now flight level 130: ""D-IC, report Bad Ragaz and now maximum flight level 130 possible"". The pilot replied with ""Roger, will report [unreadable] can you confirm start um higher?"" and wanted to make sure that he could now climb, which the FIC confirmed at 10:19:43 UTC with ""D-IC affirm, you may continue climb up to maximum flight level 130"". The pilot then replied: ""Roger, copied"". The rate of climb averaged around 550 ft/min. At 10:23 UTC, the aircraft collided with the northern flank of the GrÃ¼ehorn in the SÃ¤ntis massif at an altitude of 6800 ft AMSL on an unchanged flight path and flying in clouds.

The pilots and the two passengers sustained minor injuries.  According to the captain in the left seat, the airplane was established on a visual approach for landing on runway 23. The reported wind was from 340Â° at 3 knots gusting to 16 knots. The quartering tailwind was computed ""within limits,"" the thrust reversers were deployed at touchdown, and the airplane turned ""sharply to the right."" According to the captain, ""It felt unusual. Normal crosswind correction inputs made no difference, extreme inputs were made, and still no control was possible."" The airplane departed the right side of the runway, and the entire wing structure separated from the main fuselage, which continued for about 100 ft before coming to rest upright. The crew shut down the airplane and exited the main cabin door along with one passenger, while the second passenger egressed the airplane by the emergency exit. NTSB examination of track data and airport surveillance video revealed a nominal approach profile and that the airplane crossed the runway threshold about 120 knots groundspeed. About 9 seconds into the landing roll, the airplane turned sharply to its right. The airplane departed the runway, its left wingtip struck the ground, the entire wing structure (left wing/right wing/wingbox) separated from the airplane as one assembly, and the fuselage continued a short distance before it came to rest upright. The thrust reversers on each engine were deployed, and their positions were approximately matched.  The windsock in the foreground of the video was nearly parallel to the ground and pointed about 90Â° toward the runway and the airplane's right side. Probable Cause: The captainâs inadequate compensation for crosswind conditions, which resulted in a loss of directional control.METAR: 15:00 UTC / 11:00 local time: KMMU 021500Z 36009G14KT 10SM FEW250 06/M04 A301215:25 UTC / 11:25 local time: KMMU 021525Z 32006G14KT 10SM FEW250 07/M05 A301115:45 UTC / 11:45 local time: KMMU 021545Z 33007KT 10SM FEW250 07/M04 A3010Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA22LA175 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: eu.northjersey.com  ADS-B Exchange flight track   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates31-May-2024 07:22 ASN Updated [Narrative, Accident report, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft took off from SJO runway 07 at 15:36 UTC on a flight bound for Guatemala City. After ATC cleared the flight to FL220, the flight crew received a hydraulic system indication: ""HYDRAULIC QUANTITY"" followed by a second indication, this time for the left hydraulic system: ""HYDRAULIC SYSTEM PRESSURE (L ONLY)."" They also noticed that the left autopilot and yaw damper disengaged. From that point on, the captain took control of flying the aircraft while the first officer handled communications with ATC.  They performed the relevant procedures according to the checklist and decided to return to SJO. The flight crew prepared for an ILS approach for an emergency landing on runway 07. They knew they would not have autobrake, left reverser, rudder ratio, only some spoilers, and inoperative nose wheel steering.  During the approach, they extended the flaps and landing gear alternately. The captain adjusted the approach speed (Vapp) to 138-139 knots from the QRH's recommended 137 knots, with a Vref of 130 knots. ATC cleared them to land at 16:22 UTC with a reported wind from 240 degrees at 10 knots. On short final approach, the captain disconnected the autopilot and continued visually, executing a normal touchdown in the touchdown zone at 16:24 UTC. The landing was initially controlled by the flight crew, maintaining proper directional control with the rudder, differential brakes, right thrust reverser, and manual speed brake. However, at around 16:25 and nearing taxiway D, the aircraft began to turn right uncontrollably, resulting in an excursion off the runway at taxiway K to the south of the active runway.  There was no fire and the aircraft auffered major damage, as a result of the impact against the fence of an airport road and the rainwater collection slope. Contributing factors: 1. Fatigue and stress on the individual cables in the cross-section of the flexible hydraulic retraction hose of the L/H MLG down-locking actuator. 2. The probable inadvertent synchronised movement of the right Reverse Thrust Lever and left Engine Control Thrust Lever, as a reaction to muscle memory.METAR: 15:00 UTC / 09:00 local time: MROC 071500Z VRB04KT CAVOK 27/11 A3005 NOSIG16:00 UTC / 10:00 local time: MROC 071600Z 24008KT 200V270 CAVOK 27/16 A3005 NOSIG17:00 UTC / 11:00 local time: MROC 071700Z 24009KT 210V290 9999 FEW045 BKN250 27/19 A3003 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: DGAC Costa Rica Report number: CR-ACC-CO-02-2022 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: crprensa.com  nacion.com History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  11 February 2022 HP-2010DAE DHL Aero Expreso 0 Mexico City-Benito JuÃ¡rez International Airport (MEX/MMMX) unk 26 March 2022 HP-2010DAE DHL Aero Expreso 0 north of San JosÃ© non Loss of pressurization Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were no injuries, but the aircraft sustained substantial damage. The was operating a cargo flight from InÃ­rida (SKPD) to the San Felipe Airstrip (SKFP) with 2 crew and 12 passengers on board. The pilots carried out a visual approach to San Felipe runway 18. During the landing run, the left main gear tire exploded, and the aircraft pitched and rolled to the left. The pilot tried to control the aircraft's trajectory with brakes and engine differential power, as the directional control was not responding. The aircraft left the runway on the left side, towards the safety zone, which was flooded. The aircraft swung to the left, skidding to the right, causing the gear to fracture. The aircraft stopped and the crew shut down the engines and directed the evacuation of the passengers. Probable Cause: Lateral runway excursion, following loss of aircraft control, as a result of sudden loss of inflation pressure (blowout) of the left main landing gear tire, due to puncture of the tire by a ferrous rod (FOD) located on the runway surface. Contributing Factors Deficient safety conditions at the San Felipe airfield, due to the presence of FOD on the runway, as a consequence of the lack of an airfield maintenance program, the absence of perimeter fencing that favors the generation of foreign objects and the lack of an FOD prevention program. Deficient conditions of the safety zone of the San Felipe airfield, with an irregular, uneven and waterlogged surface, which contributed to cause or aggravate the damage to the aircraft. Non-observance by the San Felipe aerodrome administration of the recommendations issued in the Final Accident Investigation Report COL-18-28-GIA, occurred at the same aerodrome in 2018, due to a foreign object on the runway.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Aerocivil Report number: COL-22-21-DIACC Status: Investigation completedDuration: 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: www.semana.com   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight crew followed the QRH procedures and manually lowered the landing gear, and observed three green lights, indicating the gear was down and locked. The flight returned to CYMO, and the passengers were briefed on the situation and a landing was performed on runway 24. During touchdown, the flight crew heard an unusual noise from the left main gear location and felt the left wing begin to drop. The left main gear green indicator light also extinguished. The captain immediately aborted the landing, applied engine power, and became airborne, reportedly without any other parts of the aircraft coming into contact with the runway. The flight crew decided to divert to Timmins Victor M. Power Airport (CYTS), ON, a main base for the operator with emergency services, since the aircraft had sufficient fuel and VFR conditions existed throughout the route. The flight crew declared an emergency and proceeded to land on runway 21. The aircraft touched down on the nose and right landing gear and settled on the left side of the belly pod. The aircraft skidded until it stopped at the intersection of runway 10/28. All occupants exited the aircraft and no injuries were reported.Sources: TSB History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  25 January 2005 C-GYQK Pascan Aviation 0 St. Leonard Airport (CYSL), New Brunswick sub Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot suffered fatal injuries. The aircraft departed Salt Lake City International Airport, Utah (SLC) at 07:00 hours local time (13:00 UTC) on a cargo flight to BYI.  The pilot aborted the first approach to runway 20 at BYI at 08:11. The pilot executed the published missed approach procedure and reported over IREME. The controller then cleared the pilot for another RNAV approach to runway 20. After the pilot reported that she had crossed the initial approach fix, the controller approved a change to BYI advisory frequency. According to a witness, the aircraft descended out of the clouds and then immediately went into a steam cloud, which was produced from a set of six smokestacks located on the roof of a processing plant. The witness heard the engine increase in sound and saw the nose lift shortly before the airplane struck the smokestack and descend to the rooftop. The aircraft crashed 700 m north-east of the threshold of runway 20. At the time of both approaches, visibility at the airport was limited due to snowfall. PROBABLE CAUSE: The pilotâs failure to maintain altitude during an instrument approach, which resulted in a descent below the approach path and impact with a vent stack. Also causal was the failure of the processing plant to correctly paint the vent stacks, which had been determined by the FAA to be a hazard to navigation due to their proximity to the landing approach path. Contributing to the accident was the likely distraction/illusion/obscuration created by steam from the processing plant, which intermittently obscured the runway.METAR: 14:01 UTC / 08:01 local time: KBYI 131401Z AUTO 20008KT 2 1/2SM -SN BR BKN026 OVC033 M03/M05 A2996 RMK AO2 P0000 T1028105014:10 UTC / 08:10 local time: KBYI 131410Z AUTO 19008KT 1SM -SN BR BKN023 OVC028 M03/M05 A2996 RMK AO2 P0000 T1033105014:40 UTC / 08:40 local time: KBYI 131440Z AUTO 21008KT 2 1/2SM -SN BKN030 OVC047 M03/M06 A2997 RMK AO2 P0000 T10281056Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: WPR22FA151 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: newsradio1310.com  kmvt.com  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates31-May-2024 07:20 ASN Updated [Narrative, ]12-Jun-2024 11:39 ASN Updated The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Runway 11 had a Landing Distance Available (LDA) of 1400 metres. The aircraft touched down on the runway just before the 1000 ft mark (c. 300 m). Normal braking began shortly after the aircraft touched down on the runway. The PF began the go around procedure and advanced the power levers to the TO/GA position. Shortly afterwards the PF returned the power levers to the idle position, continued applying the maximum brake and then activated the emergency brake (EPB). The aircraft travelled approximately 55 m over the stopway, coming to a stop outside the paved area.  Contributing factors. - Application of controls - contributed. The use of the emergency brake was inadequate, as it disabled the anti-skid and caused the wheels to lock, which worsened the aircraft's braking capacity, leading to the runway excursion. - Airport infrastructure - undetermined. It was not possible to determine the influence of aspects relating to the adherence conditions of the SIRI runway, provided mainly by friction and surface texture, on the runway excursion. - Pilot judgement - contributed. There was inadequate judgement in the use of the EPB, which deactivated the anti-skid system and allowed the wheels to lock, reducing braking efficiency and contributing to runway excursion. - Other/Legislation - undetermined. It is possible that the lack of a specific regulation assigning criteria for the operation and maintenance of registered aerodromes may have contributed to the occurrence, as there was no way to measure the adherence of the runway, since it was not required in the legislation.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CENIPA Report number: A-049/CENIPA/2022 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 12 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: CENIPA  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates08-Feb-2024 17:53 ASN Updated [Time, Operator, Location, ]01-May-2024 09:05 ASN Updated [Source, Damage, Narrative, Category, Accident report, ]09-Jul-2024 07:07 ASN Updated 12-Feb-2025 09:41 ASN Updated Corrections or additions? ...

One of the three crew members suffered fatal injuries. The aircraft had been stuck at OZH following the Russian invasion of Ukrainen that started on February 24, 2022. Almost two months later, UR-UZB was to be ferried to Uzhgorod Airport (UDJ), away from the OZH due to fighting going on in the vicinity. In the 90 days prior to the accident, the captain had just flown for 85 minutes while the copilot and flight engineer had not made any flights. Causes: The cause of the aviation incident (collision of an airworthy aircraft with an obstacle) was the decision of the captain to carry out the flight under Visual Flight Rules (VFR) conditions in foggy weather at a critically low altitude, leading to the loss of visual contact with the ground, uncontrolled increase in speed, and the aircraft colliding with a power transmission line. Contributing Factors: 1. The flight crew's failure to decide to switch to instrument flight and climb to a safe flight altitude when encountering weather conditions that did not meet the visual meteorological flight conditions. 2. Likely use of altimeters by the flight crew to maintain flight altitude in meters when the altimeter mode was set to indicate altitude in feet. 3. The decision of the flight crew to fly at critically low altitudes with the radio altimeter and GPWS turned off. 4. The flight crew's failure to follow the departure procedure from the aerodrome area under VFR, which was discussed in detail by the flight crew during pre-flight briefings. 5. Deterioration of weather conditions after takeoff. 6. Low crew resource management (CRM) skills. 7. Retraction of flaps in a turn at an altitude lower than recommended and at a speed higher than recommended for the An-26 aircraft. 8. The complex emotional state of the crew during both preparation and execution of the flight due to combat actions conducted by the Russian Federation near the departure aerodrome. 9. Conducting the flight without meteorological support, which contradicts aviation regulations. 10. The absence of procedures for conducting flights under VFR at low and critically low altitudes for An-26 aircraft in the operator's manuals.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NBAAI Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Nexta  NBAAI   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot was not injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135 on-demand air-cargo flight. The pilot reported no difficulties during the flight or landing. While taxing the airplane after landing, the green right landing gear position indicator light extinguished, and the red gear handle light illuminated. The pilot glanced over to the circuit breaker panel and noted that the landing gear control circuit breaker had tripped. After parking the airplane for refueling, he notified his company maintenance control group about the issue and was advised to not reposition the airplane after refueling. The pilot waited about 20 minutes for weather to clear before exiting the airplane. As the pilot prepared to exit, the right main landing gear collapsed and the airplaneâs right wing impacted the ground, resulting in substantial damage. Metallurgical examination of the separated fracture surface on the right landing gear drag leg support fitting revealed an area of fatigue in a machined radius adjacent to the center lug of the drag leg support. The remainder of the fracture exhibited features consistent with overload failure. An additional crack was found in the machined radius on the opposite side of the center lug. This portion of the part had not completely separated. Exposure of the crack revealed the existence of a fatigue crack in about the same area as the first crack, with overload signatures outside of the fatigue area. The airplane maintenance manual indicated that the subject part was to be cleaned and visually inspected at least every 7,500 cycles or every 5 years, whichever occurred first. Maintenance records indicated that the part had accumulated 762 cycles since the most recent inspection 23 months before the accident. After the accident, the operator examined the drag leg support fittings on their fleet of 9 other airplanes of the same model. Of the 18 fittings examined, 14 were found to be cracked.

The pilot was flying the last rotation of the day, when at approximately 3,800 m, the low fuel level warning light lit up red. The pilot asked the 18 skydivers to jump as quickly as possible. The passenger voluntarily remained on board.  A minute later, once the drop was complete, the pilot began the descent. During this, the engine stopped. The pilot lengthened his trajectory so as not to interfere with the parachutists. He extended the flaps in landing configuration, but did not feather the propeller to avoid, according to him, a landing that took too long. On final, finding himself low on the glide path, he retracted the flaps hoping to reduce drag and thus be able to reach the runway. The aircraft lost lift and immediately sank, then touched down in a field before coming to rest in a ditch. Contributing factors: The following factors may have contributed to the forced landing short of the runway: - the decision to carry out the parachute-drop flight despite the low fuel level warning lights lighting up as soon as the engine was started, and the fuel quantities read on the gauges being less than the minimum quantity for carrying out this type of flight with this operator; - the lack of feathering of the propeller after engine shutdown, which resulted in additional drag and penalized the descent gradient; - the retraction of the flaps on final, resulting in a significant loss of lift.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Report number: BEA2022-0183 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: BEA   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot-in-command (PIC) was the pilot monitoring (PM) in the left seat, and the co-pilot was the pilot flying (PF) in the right seat and the second pilot was in the fourth cockpit seat (behind the left seat) as an observer. Investigation Conclusions As the aircraft accelerated to near V1 speed (145 knots),  while the co-pilot was holding the left rudder to maintain the direction  during the takeoff roll, the captain was distracted by items falling and lost the monitoring of the aircraft's status, and unconsciously held the left rudder which resulted in an unintended left deviation of the aircraft's direction.  After noticing the deviation, the crew did not execute the standard callouts, and the captain reduced the throttle to abort the takeoff. Due to the combined effects of maximum braking force and inertia, the crew was unable to correct effectively, causing the aircraft to veer off the runway at high speed (approximately 127 knots). After veering off the runway, the nose landing gear collided with and broke upon impact with a manhole cover and taxiway shoulder on the left side of runway 03. The aircraft continued forward due to inertia and struck an open drainage ditch 120 meters west of the runway centerline, causing the engines and main landing gear to detach. The aircraft belly touched the ground, and the aircraft caught fire and emitted smoke. Based on the extent of injuries and aircraft damage, this incident constitutes a general aviation accident caused by human error from the crew.METAR: 00:00 UTC / 08:00 local time: ZUCK 120000Z 08002MPS CAVOK 22/20 Q1010 NOSIG01:00 UTC / 09:00 local time: ZUCK 120100Z 09003MPS CAVOK 23/18 Q1010 NOSIG23:00 UTC / 07:00 local time: ZUCK 112300Z VRB01MPS CAVOK 20/20 Q1010 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: CAAC Report number: SWSW_AAR_2022_01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources: CAAC (Southwestern).

The FA realized the passenger had unlocked the lavatory door and cracked it open but did not exit. She knocked on the door and asked if everything was okay but there was no response. When the FA attempted to open the door, a female passenger started to exit the lavatory when she began to fall and grabbed on to the FA.  The FA immediately requested for the front two passengers to assist her in getting the passenger up and moved to a seat.  While assisting the passenger, the FA noticed the passenger's foot was swollen and piece of bone was sticking through her skin.  A volunteer medical professional who was onboard the airplane assisted and positioned the injured passenger in the front galley for landing.

The pilot and three passengers were seriously injured. The aircraft sustained substantial damage. The pilot reported that during the takeoff roll from Yakutat Airport, he applied takeoff engine power and about 2 seconds later attempted to raise the tail of the airplane by applying forward elevator. He said that the tail came up slightly, but it subsequently settled back to the runway. He thought this was unusual but attributed it to an aft loaded airplane, applied additional nose down trim and departed without incident.  While enroute he stated that the tail of the airplane seemed to move up and down which he attributed to turbulence. Upon arrival at Dry Bay Airport he entered a left downwind for runway 23. At an altitude of about 600 ft, he reduced engine power and extended the flaps to 10Â° abeam the end of the runway. He turned base leg about half a mile from the approach end of the runway and slowed the airplane to 80 mph. While turning final he noticed the airplane seemed to pitch up, so he applied full nose down pitch trim and extended the flaps an additional 10Â°. On short final he applied full flaps, and the airplane abruptly pitched up to about a 45Â° angle. He stated that he applied full nose down elevator, verified the pitch trim, and reduced the power to idle. When the airplane was about 300 ft above ground level, the airplane stalled, broke slightly to the left and entered about a 45Â° nose down dive. After allowing the airplane to gain airspeed, he applied full back elevator. The airplane consequently impacted forested terrain near the approach end of runway 23 at an elevation of about 18 ft, which resulted in substantial damage to the fuselage, wings, and empennage. Probable Cause: The pilotâs failure to determine the actual weight and balance of the airplane before departure, which resulted in the airplane being operated outside of the aft center of gravity limits and the subsequent aerodynamic stall on final approach. Contributing to the accident was the Federal Aviation Administration's failure to require weight and balance documentation for 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135 single-engine operations.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ANC22LA035 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: adn.com  kinyradio.com  alaskasnewssource.com   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight was a regularly scheduled passenger flight from George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH), Houston, Texas. As a result of the turbulence, one flight attendant experienced a serious injury to their wrist. The aircraft received no damage and continued to its destination without further incident.  As stated by the first officer, dispatch remarks for this flight included a forecast for light to moderate turbulence over VORTACs BUM  - JOT between FL310 - 390. The captain conducted a pre-departure briefing with the flight attendants which included the possibility of experiencing turbulence. About two hours into the flight, two flight attendants were in the last three rows of the aft cabin conducting in-flight service when light turbulence commenced. The two flight attendants decided to âbring the cart back into the galley to finish the service.â As they were pushing back into the galley, the turbulence intensified, and one of the two flight attendants asked the other to sit down in their jump seat while the other set the brake on the cart. As the flight attendant was securing the cart, the captain made an announcement asking the flight attendants to take their seats. At that time, the flight attendant who was securing the cart lost their footing and fell back where the other flight attendant had taken their seat. The seated flight attendant attempted to brace the falling flight attendant and injured their wrist.  The captain stated that this instance of turbulence lasted about 15 seconds. In addition, he reported that that the seatbelt sign had been on for five minutes prior to this moderate turbulence as the aircraft flew through light turbulence earlier in the flight. The injured flight attendant was treated by an onboard doctor, and the flight proceeded to its destination without further incident. Upon arrival to Toronto, paramedics met the airplane.

The pilot-in-command stated that during the take-off run, the power was set for take-off at 1800 feet/pounds (lbs) of torque (TG) whilst the aircraft was still stationary with the brakes on. The flaps were configured for take-off/approach. Thereafter, the pilot-in-command released the brakes and proceeded with the take-off roll on runway 07. The aircraft continued with the take-off roll and the co-pilot made a 60 knots (kt) call. During this time, the aircraft rolled onto an uneven surface, which caused the aircraft to bounce and, as a quick resolve to prevent the nose wheel from slamming down hard on the ground, the pilot applied a slight back pressure on the control column. Following the bounce, the aircraft landed on its main wheels. Shortly thereafter, the aircraft experienced another unexpected bounce and was airborne in a high-nose attitude, and soon after, descended back onto the runway and veered off to the left-side. The pilot-in-command had the back pressure still applied, and he did not push the control column forward to make the wheels stick on the ground. This resulted in a premature take-off. To prevent the aircraft from veering off, the pilot applied the right rudder to bring the aircraft back on the runway, but the aircraft kept yawing to the left with a slight left roll. He further stated that he did not attempt to abort take-off as the aircraft was no longer above the runway.  The pilot-in-command reported that a decision to continue with the flight was taken, but due to the aircraftÂs speed that was below the required rotational (Vr) speed, a stall warning light illuminated, followed by an aural warning. A full right rudder was applied but the aircraft continued to yaw to the left. The aircraft stalled and later collided with the tree before it impacted the ground. It then skidded for approximately 350m before it hit a duiker/buck, which was fatally wounded. Probable cause: Loss of control during take-off as a result of an early rotation, causing a couple of bounces followed by a stall before the aircraft veered off to the left-side of the runway and, subsequently, crashed.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CAA S.A.

All 22 occupants suffered fatal injuries. The flight was the first of five Tara Air flights from Pokhara to Jomsom that day and scheduled to depart at 06:15 hours.  The flight was delayed because the Lete Pass on the route was covered up with clouds. The Twin Otter finally departed at 09:55, after two aircraft of Summit Air had departed for Jomsom.  9N-AET was supposed to take-off as the second flight but the captain seemed hesitant to commence  the flight due to a weather report from the first Summit Air flight that, the en-route weather was not favorable for VFR flights and critical around LETE and TATOPANI. The cockpit voice recording revealed that someone, either ground staff or some intimate passenger to the crew, advised the PIC strongly to conduct the flight. The aircraft took off from Pokhara from runway 04. The Tower controller instructed to ""report 5 DME northwest runway 04"". Then after departure the aircraft turned left to maintain a heading of 345 and planned to join heading 305 degree towards Ghodepani. After four minutes, flight 197 reported, ""Now on course... 6000 climbing and ETA Jomsom 32"" (0432 UTC). At 04:21 UTC flight 197 reported to Pokhara Tower as position approaching Ghodepani 12000 climbing for 12500.  After 6 Seconds ATC Pokhara asked flight 197, ""confirm would like to change level and TRA 197 replied, ÂNo Ma'am we have crossed Ghodepani and like to be onÂ. Pokhara Tower  instructed, ÂTara 197 contact Jomsom Tower 122.5Â CVR recordings show that after flight 197 crossed Ghodepani, the PIC was not comfortable with the en-route weather. However, the flight was continued following the advice of the preceding Summit Air flight. At 04:26 UTC, flight 197 made the first contact with Jomsom AFS and reported its position to which Jomsom Tower conveyed the prevailing weather as ""Wind South Westerly up to 30 kts, QNH 1019, Temp 18Âº"". The PIC of flight 197 reconfirmed twice if the wind was maximum, up to 30 kts and currently South Westerly 25 kts. The crew was discussing about the bad weather being  encountered and the PIC himself voiced his dissatisfaction about the behavior of other pilots who conduct VFR flights in such unfavorable weather. The CVR recordings reveal that the aircraft was encountering clouds and the PIC was trying his best to remain clear of the clouds.  The PIC was searching for light and brighter areas and adamantly heading towards it. The aircraft was maintaining 12000 ft and was in a climbing attitude.  During the continuous attempts of crew to avoid the clouds with Terrain Avoidance and Warning System (TAWS) inhibited, the aircraft struck rocky terrain at an altitude of 4050 meters AMSL at Sanusare Mountain.  The cockpit voice recoerder readout showed that the aural GPWS warning, a function of TAWS, was triggered approximately 3 seconds prior to the impact. However, there was no aural warning of enhanced Forward Looking Terrain Alert (FLTA), Premature Descent Alert (PDA), and Imminent Terrain  Impact (ITI) Alert/Warning function of TAWS. Further investigation of tht TAWS showed that it was configured to use GPS altitude, however no data was received by the system. This was likely caused by the misconfiguration of the RS-232 output format from the Garmin GPS receiver. As a result Corrected Barometric Altitude (CBA), computed by the Air Data Computer (ADC), was the only altitude input. In order to compute a reliable CBA, a regional barometric pressure setting must be entered into the ADC. This had not been done, so during the previous flights the CBA was off by 73 to 866 feet. Due to an overabundance of nuisance alerts, the TAWS was inhibited. Probable Cause: The probable cause of this accident was the flight crew's failure to monitor and maintain the proper course while inadvertently flying in IMC conditions with the aircraft Terrain Avoidance and Warning System [TAWS] inhibited which resulted into a CFIT accident. Contributing factors: 1. The flight crew's failure to follow the SOP of company 2. The aircraft flight operation with TAWS inhibited during deteriorating en-route weather condition. 3. Loss of situational awareness of crew 4. Deteriorating en-route weather 5. Less experienced copilot for that sector and high crew gradient 6. Poor CRM during the flight 7. The whole cockpit duties [both PF and PM] were undertaken by the PlC, which likely impaired his performance. 8.

The pilot in training was fatally injured and the pilot was seriously injured.  The pilots were performing skydiving flights while the right-seated pilot was training the left-seated pilot on the operation. The pilots completed six flights without incident and completed the drop of the skydivers on the accident flight normally. The right-seated pilot could not completely recollect the minutes leading up to the accident due to his injuries. He did recall that airplane was descending as expected with the power at idle. The recorded ADS-B data revealed that after turning onto final approach, the airplane then completed a right 360Â° turn presumably because the altitude was too high. The right-seated pilot attempted to increase the power by slightly nudging the throttle forward and thought the engine power did not increase as expected.  A performance study revealed that in the last 70 seconds of recorded data, the airplane underwent a series of speed and thrust oscillations consistent with a pilot increasing and then decreasing the power lever. The right seat pilot recalls aiming for an open dirt field and observing a bermÂ in the immediate flight path. In an effort to avoid the berm, he maneuvered the airplane into a right turn. The airplane landed short of the runway, resulting in a collision with the berm. The engine was producing power at the time of impact. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.  The right-seated pilot was in the process of training the left-seated pilot and stated that he took over the controls during the final approach. It is unknown when he took over the controls, so it is unknown which pilot was at the controls during the speed oscillations. The right-seated pilot likely took over the controls too late and the airplane impacted the terrain. The left-seated pilot's ability to hear the changes in engine power might have been hindered because she was listening to music through her headset at an elevated decibel level.  The airplane was modified by a Supplemental Type Certificate that replaces the original Pratt & Whitney PT-6 turbine engine with a Honeywell TPE331 turbine engine. The TPE331 engine's characteristics are such that if the airplane is on final approach with the power near idle, the throttle sensitivity (change in thrust per unit of power lever movement) increases around the transition between the propeller-governing and underspeed-governing modes of the engine, which corresponds to a zero-thrust condition. Near this transition point, small movements of the power lever (about Â¼  to Â½ inch of deflection) can result in relatively large thrust changes that can surprise pilots inexperienced with this behavior and result in pilot-induced oscillations (PIO). Given the thrust oscillations observed shortly before the end of the ADS-B data, it is likely that the left-seated pilot was at the controls and experienced such a PIO on a short final approach to land. Probable Cause: The right-seated pilot's failure to correct the left-seated pilot's mismanagement of the engine thrust, which resulted in undesired speed and thrust oscillations during the final approach and a subsequent descent into terrain.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: WPR22FA197 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB WPR22FA197  flightaware.com History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  3 January 1997 C-FTZF Nakina Outpost Camps & Airservice 0 Nakina Airport, ON (YQN) sub 21 July 2016 N7581F Skydive Twin Cities 0 Baldwin Airport, WI sub Runway excursion Location  Images: Photo: NTSB Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates20-Jul-2024 09:18 ASN Update Bot Updated [Time, Operator, Other fatalities, Phase, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, Category, ]20-Jul-2024 09:25 ASN Updated [Operator, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, ]20-Jul-2024 09:26 ASN Updated [Photo, ]20-Jul-2024 09:27 ASN Updated Corrections or additions? ...

The flight departed Santo Domingo International Airport (SDQ), Dominican Republic , at 15:35. The aircraft was cleared for the ILS runway 09 at MIA and the crew reported that the approach was normal. The first officer stated to the NTSB that the landing was smooth, and they first touched down on the right main gear followed by the left main gear slightly right of centerline. The crew felt an increasing vibration on the left side of the airplane shortly after the left main gear touched down. During the landing roll out the left main gear collapsed, the airplane traveled to the left where it eventually departed the paved surface and impacted the runway 30 glide slope equipment shelter. During departure from the paved surface and impact with the steel and concrete shelter, the airplane's right main landing gear and nosewheel collapsed, and the fuel tanks were breached. Shortly after the airplane came to a stop, a post-crash fire began on the right wing. All 130 passengers and 10 crew evacuated the airplane, of which 4 passengers sustained minor injuries. Probable Cause: The structural failure of the left main landing gear downlock following ineffective shimmy dampening during the landing roll which caused the collapse of the left main landing gear, resulting in a runway excursion and post-flight fire.METAR: 20:53 UTC / 16:53 local time: KMIA 212053Z COR 05010G18KT 10SM FEW030 BKN250 30/19 A3008 RMK AO2 SLP187 CB DSNT SE AND SW MOV S T03000194 $21:53 UTC / 17:53 local time: KMIA 212153Z 05009G16KT 10SM FEW030 FEW045 BKN250 30/16 A3008 RMK AO2 SLP187 T03000161 $Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA22FA132 Status: Duration: 1 year and 10 monthsDownload report: Sources: wsvn.com  www.miamiherald.com  RED Air statement  NRSB   Location  Images: photo (c) FAA; Miami International Airport, FL (MIA); 21 June 2022; (publicdomain) photo (c) David Russell; Miami International Airport, FL (MIA); 29 April 2022 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates28-Apr-2024 08:36 ASN Updated [Narrative, ]28-Apr-2024 08:36 ASN Updated 17-May-2024 19:00 ASN Updated Corrections or additions? ...

The flight attendant fell, hitting the lower back on the floor (sacrum fracture). The aircraft landed at Itami Airport at 13:55. Probable Cause: The JTSB concludes that as while the Belt Sign was off, the Aircraft encountered an airflow disturbance due to convective clouds and was shaken violently, which made the body of L2 float in mid-air when the L2 was squatting while working in the galley in the aft side of the Aircraft, resulting in getting out of balance to fall down on the floor and most likely sustaining the injury.  It is possible that the aircraft encountered airflow turbulence caused by convective clouds because of inadequate maneuvering to avoid them, and besides because it was difficult to detect developing convective clouds from onboard weather radar, the aircraft was likely not to be able to maintain an adequate distance from them.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JTSB Report number: AA2023-7 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: https://jtsb.mlit.go.jp/jtsb/aircraft/detail2.php?id=2324  https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/ja854a#2c62e521 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  25 April 2017 JA854A All Nippon Airways - ANA 0 Chubu Centrair International Airport/Nagoya (NGO/RJGG) min Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates11-Jun-2024 17:56 ASN Updated [Narrative, Accident report, ] Corrections or additions? ...

After takeoff the aircraft climbed to the cruising altitude flight level 210 (FL210) in accordance with the flight plan. During the descent to Venetia Mine, the first officer made a radio call to the aerodrome inspector on the VHF radio to inform him that they would be landing shortly. Thereafter, the aerodrome inspector went to perform a runway inspection. Once complete, the aerodrome inspector informed the flight that he had completed the runway inspection and that it was clear of foreign object debris and no wildlife was spotted close to the runway.  The crew stated that touchdown was normal on runway 08, however, during the landing roll at a ground speed of approximately 104 knots, with the propellers in the reverse thrust configuration (course pitch), a large bird (Kori Bustard) got airborne from the grass area next to the runway on the right side. The bird impacted the no.2 (right-side) propeller and one of the blades was severed. Some fragments from the blade penetrated the fuselage (third row of seats).  According to the crew, the bird strike caused the aircraft to shake and the number 2 engine to show an over temperature indication. The Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT) indication was over 750Â°C. The crew followed the engine shut down procedure while bringing the aircraft to a stop on the runway. After the aircraft had stopped, the captain, through the intercom, spoke with the passengers to check if they were harmed. The cabin crew member reported that nobody was injured after checking with the passengers. The crew then taxied the aircraft to the apron with only the left engine in operation. Once the engine was shut down, the passengers disembarked the aircraft. The aircraft sustained substantial damage. Probable Cause A bird strike on the propeller blade caused the overload fracture and separation failure of the blade. Contributory Factors: 1. Inadequate control of wildlife at the airfield. 2. Inadequate number of trained personnel to monitor and deter possible wildlife during aircraft operations.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CAA S.A.

About 11:48 local time JetBlueâs 1748 flight crew announced on the common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF) that they were leaving the ramp area to taxi to runway 10 for departure. A few seconds later, a Beechcraft B300 King Air, N350J, on an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan reported on the local CTAF that they were ""about 9 minutes out, for ten, coming in from the east, descending out of 17,000 ft"". The UNICOM operator at HDN responded to N350J stating that there were ""multiple aircraft inbound"" and winds were calm and provided the altimeter setting. After this exchange, the JetBlue crew began discussing the active runway and the multiple inbound airplanes using runway 10. About the time the JetBlue flight crew was starting their second engine and conducting engine checks, the King Air flight crew was contacting Denver ARTCC to cancel their IFR flight plan because they had visually acquired HDN and intended to land on runway 28. The Denver ARTCC controller acknowledged the IFR cancellation. The King Airâs flight crew subsequently announced, about 11:53 on CTAF that they were ""going to go ahead and land two eight"" and were ""straight-in two eight right now"". About 10 seconds later, the JetBlue flight crew announced on CTAF they were leaving the ramp area and were taxiing to runway 10 for departure. HDN UNICOM reported that multiple airplanes were inbound, and the winds were calm. While the JetBlue flight crew was performing an after-start checklist, the King Air announced on CTAF they were on a ""12-mile final two eight straight-in"". About 45 seconds later, the King Air asked on CTAF if anyone was about to depart from runway 10, and the JetBlue flight crew replied that they intended to hold on the taxiway near the end of runway 10 and wait for a clearance from Denver ARTCC. The King Air replied they were on a ""10-mile final, two eight, straight-in"". The JetBlue flight crew said ""alright, copy"" and that they would keep an eye out for them. About 11:55, the JetBlue flight crew received clearance to their destination after reporting to Denver ARTCC that they were ready for departure on runway 10 at HDN.  The JetBlue flight crew then announced on CTAF that they had received their clearance and would be departing on ""runway one zero"". Within 5 seconds, the King Airâs flight crew reported they ""had a king air on final two eight"" and that they ""had been calling."" JetBlueâs flight crew replied on CTAF that they thought the King Air was ""8 or 9 miles out"", to which the King Air replied they were 4 miles out, ""even less than that."" The JetBlue first officer, (pilot monitoring (PM)) stated that they looked for the airplane both visually and on their onboard traffic alert and collision avoidance system (TCAS) and did not see any air traffic. JetBlue flight crew acknowledged the King Air, looked for traffic approaching runway 10, and announced on CTAF that they were beginning their takeoff from runway 10 at HDN. The King Airâs flight crew replied that they were on a short final and ""I hope you donât hit us.""  According to ADS-B data, when JetBlue taxied onto runway 10 the King Air was on a reciprocal course 4.91 nautical miles from JetBlue. JetBlueâs crew increased thrust for takeoff about 11:57. About 11 seconds later, just prior to the 80 knots call out, the PM asked the PF if the King Air was on runway 28. The captain (pilot flying (PF)) asked ""is he?"" to which the PM said ""Yes, he is on 28, do you see him?"" to which the PF said no.  About 20 seconds after JetBlue started their take off on runway 10, the flight crew of the King Air asked JetBlue if they were going to do a quick turn-out, to which they replied, ""yes sir."" Concurrent to this conversation, JetBlueâs captain pitched the airplane up, 24 knots before rotation speed, to avoid the approaching King Air and subsequently struck the tail of the airplane on the runwayâs surface. He began a climbing right turn away from the traffic indicated on the TCAS. JetBlueâs captain and first officer both stated they never visually acquired the approaching King Air. According to ADS-B data, when JetBlue began its right turn after departure from runway 10 the King Air was on a reciprocal course with 2.27 nautical miles of separation between the converging airplanes.  While climbing to their cruising altitude, the flight crew discussed what had happened and consulted a jetBlue maintenance controller on their tailstrike. It was decided to divert to Denver for damage assessment.  The flight safely landed at Denver at 12:42 hours. Probable Cause: The captainâs rotation of the airplane pitch before the rotation speed on takeoff due to his surprise about encountering head on landing traffic, which resulted in an exceedance of the airplaneâs pitch limit and a subsequent tail strike. Contributing to the accident was the flight crewâs expectation bias that the incoming aircraft was landing on the same runway as they were departing from, and the conflicting trafficâs nonstandard use of phraseology when making position calls on the common traffic advisory frequency.METAR: 17:56 UTC / 10:56 local time: KHDN 221756Z AUTO 21005KT 8SM -SN FEW003 M11/M14 A3037 RMK AO2 SNB11 SLP364 P0000 60000 T11061144 11072 21144 51008 FZRANO19:23 UTC / 12:23 local time: KHDN 221923Z AUTO 19003KT 10SM BKN003 M06/M14 A3035 RMK AO2 FZRANOAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA22LA069 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Flightaware   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Control was lost during an attempted landing in a strong crosswind, following an ILS approach. The left wingtip struck the runway several times and remained in contact with the ground as the aircraft departed the paved surface into the grass area at the side of the runway. The aircraftâs stick pusher also activated, resulting in a hard landing that damaged the aircraftâs nose landing gear assembly. The flight then diverted to London-Gatwick Airport, where it landed at 00:51 UTC. Conclusion The aircraft yawed and rolled rapidly following a long float with insufficient airspeed in strong gusting wind conditions. Stick shaker activation was followed almost immediately by stick pusher activation, resulting in the aircraft landing on its nosewheel. A crosswind exceeding the commanderâs personal limit was forecast before departure. It would have been possible to delay departure or select an alternative arrival aerodrome with more favourable conditions.  The commander reflected that although there was an opportunity to discontinue the approach earlier, he had felt compelled to continue with the landing by a degree of plan continuation bias. Fatigue, commercial pressure and the nature of their interactions may have made the pilots more susceptible to this bias.METAR: 00:20 UTC / 00:20 local time: EGSS 310020Z AUTO 30013G24KT 9999 NCD 07/03 Q101600:50 UTC / 00:50 local time: EGSS 310050Z AUTO 29012KT 260V320 9999 NCD 07/02 Q101623:50 UTC / 23:50 local time: EGSS 302350Z AUTO 29013KT 250V330 9999 -RA SCT014/// SCT021/// BKN039/// //////TCU 07/04 Q1016Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: AAIB-27993 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Flightaware track  NTSB  Salvage tender   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft was operated on a mission that consisted of a multi-day cross country training and familiarization trip with three military aircrew members onboard. The accident happened on the first segment of the mission. The crew was cleared for the RNAV Z 25 instrument approach into the Thunder Bay Airport. The weather consisted of light winds and good visibility, with a ceiling at 2200 ft AGL. The approach proceeded normally and as the aircraft crossed through 600 ft AGL, the Pilot Flying elected to disconnect the autopilot and continue under manual control. Shortly after the aircraft crossed over the threshold of runway 25, the flying pilot reduced the two power levers to the idle position for landing. The aircraft experienced a yaw to the left and a significant drop of the left wing. The crew initiated an overshoot, however the aircraft continued to descend and the left wing impacted the runway surface. The aircraft progressed off the runway onto the snow-covered infield.

Most probably, the reduced power was caused by setting the PM-1 magneto switch to position ""1"" before takeoff instead of position ""1+2"" as stipulated by the flight manual. The most likely contributing factors were: - long flight interruptions by both crew members prior to the emergency flight; - shortcomings in training and interaction of crew members, as well as insufficient flight training, which resulted in loss of control over flight speed.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: life.ru  EMERCOM Russia   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The approach was flown about 80 knots and about 100 ft above the normal flight path, the stated to the NTSB. After touchdown the airplane ""leaned to the right"" and veered off the right side of the runway. The commercial pilot seated in the back stated it was not a hard landing, but it was ""harder than anything he had experienced before at that airport."" The right-hand wing was partially severed at the wing root and the airplane came to a stop in the grass on the left side of the runway. The right propeller blades displayed tip curling and the orange-painted wingtip displayed impact damage and longitudinal scraping and asphalt transfer. Probable Cause: The flight crewÂs failure to arrest the descent rate during the non-standard approach, which resulted in a hard landing and failure of the right-wing structure. Contributing was the flight instructorÂs selection of a challenging approach for initial training.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA22LA123 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: FAA   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The first leg was uneventful. The controller cleared the flight to back track on runway 06/24 to the threshold of runway 06 for takeoff. After having taxied about 200 m, the right engine apparently experienced a substantial periodic acceleration to a taxi speed of 36 knots, where a maximum speed of 10 knots is allowed by the manufacturer. After the right engine accelerated, there was a trajectory change to the left side of the runway centerline. The crew attempted to keep the aircraft within the runway, however, the crew's efforts did not have a positive result, allowing the aircraft to drift out of the runway into the safety zone. When the aircraft was over the safety zone, the crew attempted to use the braking system, however, the brakes were not effective due to the poor traction of the aircraft's wheels with the grass surface in the safety zone.  The aircraft continued to taxi to the left of the runway, until coming to a complete stop when the nose of the aircraft collided with a concrete wall bordering the airport.  The aircraft suffered substantial damage in the nose area, however, the stress concentration due to the impact was more evident in the left front fuselage area, structurally compromising a large part of the skin. Probable Cause Runway excursion, as a result of loss of directional control of the aircraft, when exceeding the maximum taxi speed allowed by the aircraft manufacturer. Contributing Factors Possible misuse of the nose wheel steering control system, nose wheel steering, by the crew when using it above the allowed speed, hindering directional control. Lack of standardization of the company's operating procedures, as it lacks its own taxiing policies and procedures. Probable self-imposed pressure from the crew, due to their desire to comply with the scheduled operation. Overconfidence, complacency, loss of situational awareness, and inadequate application of CRM by the crew, during a normal operation of the aircraft, which was apparently free of hazards.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Aerocivil Report number: COL-22-10-DIACC Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: Aerocivil   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were no injuries. According to the captain's statement to the NTSB, before departure, the airplane and runway were clear of any contaminants, all pre-takeoff checks were normal, and the flaps were set to 15Â°. During the takeoff clearance for runway 33, the air traffic control tower reported the wind was from 160Â° at 16 knots, gusting to 25 knots, and the instantaneous wind was from 180Â° at 10 knots. The captain performed a static takeoff, and the first officer made all of the callouts; airspeed alive, 80 knots, V1, and rotate. At rotation speed, the captain applied back pressure on the yoke; however, the airplane would not become airborne. The captain reported, ""the yoke did not have any air resistance or any pressure on it as we experience normally in Hawkers."" After a few seconds and without any indication the airplane would take off, the captain aborted the takeoff. The captain reduced the engines to idle, deployed the thrust reversers, and applied the brakes. The airplane subsequently departed the end of the runway into the snow.  Aspen Airport is located in a high mountain valley with mountainous terrain from 12500-14000 feet msl in near proximity to the airport. Instrument departures demand takeoff from runway 33 due to surrounding terrain. As N99AP was cleared for takeoff, ATC reported winds from 160 degrees at 16 knots, gusting to 25 knots. The Takeoff Runway Available (TORA) is 8006 feet (2440 m). Probable Cause and Findings The flight crewâs decision to takeoff in tailwind conditions that were consistently above the airplaneâs tailwind limitation, which resulted in a runway overrun following an aborted takeoff.  Contributing was the flight crewâs use of the instantaneous wind report for the decision to attempt the takeoff.METAR: 18:53 UTC / 11:53 local time: KASE 211853Z 16016G25KT 10SM FEW036 BKN060 01/M09 A2961 RMK AO2 PK WND 17027/1841 SLP988 T00111094Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN22LA130 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: www.aspentimes.com  www.aspendailynews.com  https://www.underwriterssalvagecompany.com/Listing/Details/733725/1999-Raytheon-Hawker-800-XP  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates01-Jul-2024 08:51 ASN Updated [Narrative, Accident report, ]08-Jul-2024 12:57 ASN Updated [Source, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot and passenger were seriously injured.  The pilot stated that the pilot-rated passenger was spending the day observing the skydiving operation. He had made three consecutive flights climbing to around 13,000 feet mean sea level (msl) to unload the skydivers. On the fourth flight, the pilot departed runway 25 and made a gradual climb to 12,700 ft msl as he circled back to the airport. The skydivers departed the airplane and the pilot initiated a steep, turning descent with the power at idle. He stated that the airplane was in âbeta modeâ but that the power lever was above the flight idle gate and the speed lever was left in the high position. The pilot stated that, while the airplane was on the base leg of the traffic pattern to runway 25, at an altitude about 4,000 ft msl and a descent rate of 4,500 fpm, he attempted to arrest the descent by adding power. The pilot further stated that despite his attempt to add power, the engine did not respond to movements of the power lever. He moved the propeller speed lever, which also had no effect. The pilot presumed that the engine had flamed out and attempted a restart. With the propeller still windmilling, he switched the ignition to âcontinuousâ and turned the boost pump on. He observed the torque gauge increase from 0% to 20%, but the engine was still unresponsive to movements of the power lever. He applied full nose-up trim and pulled the control yoke full aft against the stop, but the airplane would not maintain a level attitude. With the airplane in a noselow attitude, it collided with terrain about 1,400 ft short of the runway below). The pilot did not feather the propeller.  Probable Cause The pilotâs intentional inflight operation of the propeller in beta, which led to an aerodynamic lock, his inability to restore forward thrust, and subsequent collision with terrain.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: WPR22LA114 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: sandiegouniontribune.com  nbcsandiego.com History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  17 August 2008 F-OIJO Tropic Airlines 0 Saint BarthÃ©lÃ©my, French Antilles non Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates31-May-2024 07:30 ASN Updated [Aircraft type, Narrative, Accident report, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

This flight lasted about 1 hour 10 minutes. He then flew 1 hour southeast and started a second survey. After about 3 hours of total flight time, he proceeded to Pleasanton Municipal Airport (PEZ) to get fuel. During the descent, the ""left fuel low"" light illuminated, and shortly thereafter the ""reservoir fuel low"" light illuminated. The pilot ensured the fuel tanks, fuel pump, and igniters were on, and he diverted to a nearby private strip. Soon after, the airplaneÂs engine began to lose power. The pilot increased the throttle, but the engine lost total power. The airplane descended rapidly when it struck several trees and touched down on an upsloping field short of the runway. The wing spar in the airplaneÂs right wing sustained substantial damage. Probable Cause: The pilot's fuel mismanagement, which resulted in a total loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion and subsequent impact with trees during a forced landing.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN22LA134 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  22 January 1998 C-FAFV Alta Flights (Charters) Inc. 0 Edmonton International Airport, AB (YEG/CYEG) sub Loss of control 4 March 2019 C-FAFV Amik Aviation 0 1,4 km S of Little Grand Rapids Airport, MB (ZGR) sub Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight crew reported they flew a normal flight and a stabilized approach in gusty wind conditions. Performance data indicated they would require about 3,000 ft of runway for landing on the 6,995 ft long runway, and they added 5 knots (kts) to the approach speed due to the gusts. Data indicated that the airplane landed in the touchdown zone and at an appropriate airspeed of 110 kts (104 kts groundspeed); however, the pilot's and co-pilot's application of brakes was unsuccessful in achieving sufficient braking action. The airplane departed the runway at a groundspeed of 58 kts and came to rest against a perimeter fence 450 ft past the runway. A witness stated the airplane landed long; however, his distance from the runway and his angle of view of the airplane may have prevented an accurate assessment.  Although the airplane flight manual states that if the brake system or antiskid fails, the pilot(s) are to attempt to pull the emergency brake, the pilots were unable to locate the emergency brake and instead pulled the parking brake. Although an examination of the braking system failed to find an anomaly, a performance study revealed that during the ground rollout the deceleration was primarily due to aerodynamic drag and free rolling 'unbraked' wheel friction for about 5,000 ft and that there was virtually no evidence of deceleration due to hydraulic or pneumatic wheel braking during the rollout. However, the pilots' inability to locate and use the emergency brake contributed to the insufficient braking. The crew failed to immediately recognize the issue and locate and utilize the emergency brake for supplemental braking authority. Probable Cause: And undetermined failure of the brake system. Contributing to the accident was the failure of the pilots to locate and operate the emergency brake control, which resulted in a runway excursion and collision with terrain and an object.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA22LA148 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources: www.wlox.com  FAA   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates04-Apr-2024 08:35 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The occupants suffered minor injuries. The aircraft was en route to an ice strip on Springpole Lake, Ontario. At 12:50, a snow squall began to move across CYXL, reducing ground visibility. The pilot taxied the aircraft to a position on the apron and waited for the fast-moving snow squall to pass. At 13:01, the pilot taxied the aircraft to runway 34 and took off in visual meteorological conditions. The aircraft climbed to approximately 1800 feet above sea level (ASL), then, once clear of the control zone, it descended to approximately 1600 to 1700 feet ASL, roughly 500 to 600 feet above ground level (AGL), to remain below the overcast ceiling. As the aircraft began to cross Lac Seul, Ontario, the visibility straight ahead and to the west was good. However, when the aircraft was roughly midway across the lake, it encountered turbulence and immediately became enveloped in whiteout conditions generated by a snow squall. The pilot turned his head to inspect the left wing and saw that ice appeared to be accumulating on the leading edge.

The pilot suffered fatal injuries. On 29 March 2022, the day before the accident, the pilot was flying the Cessna 208, registered as D-FLIC, from Costa dâArgento Airfield in Italy to the Siegerland Airport (EDSG) for maintenance. He flew over the SÃ¤ntis massif under visual flight rules at an altitude of approximately 8200 ft AMSL and on the same route as on the day of the accident, namely on the direct connecting line between the waypoints PELAD and DEGES provided for flights under instrument flight rules. On 30 March 2022 at 09:02 UTC, the pilot took off in the Cessna 208 from EDSG on a visual flight to the airport Arezzo (LIQB) in Italy. At 10:19 UTC, he passed the waypoint DEGES at 5400 ft AMSL. He was in radio contact with FIC Zurich, which had instructed him to remain under the Zurich terminal area (TMA). This airspace has a lower limit of 7500 ft AMSL at DEGES. After passing DEGES, the pilot flew as planned in the direction of waypoint PELAD and at 10:19:31 UTC the FIC informed him that the maximum permitted altitude for visual flights without authorisation to enter controlled airspace was now flight level 130: ""D-IC, report Bad Ragaz and now maximum flight level 130 possible"". The pilot replied with ""Roger, will report [unreadable] can you confirm start um higher?"" and wanted to make sure that he could now climb, which the FIC confirmed at 10:19:43 UTC with ""D-IC affirm, you may continue climb up to maximum flight level 130"". The pilot then replied: ""Roger, copied"". The rate of climb averaged around 550 ft/min. At 10:23 UTC, the aircraft collided with the northern flank of the GrÃ¼ehorn in the SÃ¤ntis massif at an altitude of 6800 ft AMSL on an unchanged flight path and flying in clouds.

The pilots and the two passengers sustained minor injuries.  According to the captain in the left seat, the airplane was established on a visual approach for landing on runway 23. The reported wind was from 340Â° at 3 knots gusting to 16 knots. The quartering tailwind was computed ""within limits,"" the thrust reversers were deployed at touchdown, and the airplane turned ""sharply to the right."" According to the captain, ""It felt unusual. Normal crosswind correction inputs made no difference, extreme inputs were made, and still no control was possible."" The airplane departed the right side of the runway, and the entire wing structure separated from the main fuselage, which continued for about 100 ft before coming to rest upright. The crew shut down the airplane and exited the main cabin door along with one passenger, while the second passenger egressed the airplane by the emergency exit. NTSB examination of track data and airport surveillance video revealed a nominal approach profile and that the airplane crossed the runway threshold about 120 knots groundspeed. About 9 seconds into the landing roll, the airplane turned sharply to its right. The airplane departed the runway, its left wingtip struck the ground, the entire wing structure (left wing/right wing/wingbox) separated from the airplane as one assembly, and the fuselage continued a short distance before it came to rest upright. The thrust reversers on each engine were deployed, and their positions were approximately matched.  The windsock in the foreground of the video was nearly parallel to the ground and pointed about 90Â° toward the runway and the airplane's right side. Probable Cause: The captainâs inadequate compensation for crosswind conditions, which resulted in a loss of directional control.METAR: 15:00 UTC / 11:00 local time: KMMU 021500Z 36009G14KT 10SM FEW250 06/M04 A301215:25 UTC / 11:25 local time: KMMU 021525Z 32006G14KT 10SM FEW250 07/M05 A301115:45 UTC / 11:45 local time: KMMU 021545Z 33007KT 10SM FEW250 07/M04 A3010Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA22LA175 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: eu.northjersey.com  ADS-B Exchange flight track   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates31-May-2024 07:22 ASN Updated [Narrative, Accident report, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft took off from SJO runway 07 at 15:36 UTC on a flight bound for Guatemala City. After ATC cleared the flight to FL220, the flight crew received a hydraulic system indication: ""HYDRAULIC QUANTITY"" followed by a second indication, this time for the left hydraulic system: ""HYDRAULIC SYSTEM PRESSURE (L ONLY)."" They also noticed that the left autopilot and yaw damper disengaged. From that point on, the captain took control of flying the aircraft while the first officer handled communications with ATC.  They performed the relevant procedures according to the checklist and decided to return to SJO. The flight crew prepared for an ILS approach for an emergency landing on runway 07. They knew they would not have autobrake, left reverser, rudder ratio, only some spoilers, and inoperative nose wheel steering.  During the approach, they extended the flaps and landing gear alternately. The captain adjusted the approach speed (Vapp) to 138-139 knots from the QRH's recommended 137 knots, with a Vref of 130 knots. ATC cleared them to land at 16:22 UTC with a reported wind from 240 degrees at 10 knots. On short final approach, the captain disconnected the autopilot and continued visually, executing a normal touchdown in the touchdown zone at 16:24 UTC. The landing was initially controlled by the flight crew, maintaining proper directional control with the rudder, differential brakes, right thrust reverser, and manual speed brake. However, at around 16:25 and nearing taxiway D, the aircraft began to turn right uncontrollably, resulting in an excursion off the runway at taxiway K to the south of the active runway.  There was no fire and the aircraft auffered major damage, as a result of the impact against the fence of an airport road and the rainwater collection slope. Contributing factors: 1. Fatigue and stress on the individual cables in the cross-section of the flexible hydraulic retraction hose of the L/H MLG down-locking actuator. 2.

There were no injuries, but the aircraft sustained substantial damage. The was operating a cargo flight from InÃ­rida (SKPD) to the San Felipe Airstrip (SKFP) with 2 crew and 12 passengers on board. The pilots carried out a visual approach to San Felipe runway 18. During the landing run, the left main gear tire exploded, and the aircraft pitched and rolled to the left. The pilot tried to control the aircraft's trajectory with brakes and engine differential power, as the directional control was not responding. The aircraft left the runway on the left side, towards the safety zone, which was flooded. The aircraft swung to the left, skidding to the right, causing the gear to fracture. The aircraft stopped and the crew shut down the engines and directed the evacuation of the passengers. Probable Cause: Lateral runway excursion, following loss of aircraft control, as a result of sudden loss of inflation pressure (blowout) of the left main landing gear tire, due to puncture of the tire by a ferrous rod (FOD) located on the runway surface. Contributing Factors Deficient safety conditions at the San Felipe airfield, due to the presence of FOD on the runway, as a consequence of the lack of an airfield maintenance program, the absence of perimeter fencing that favors the generation of foreign objects and the lack of an FOD prevention program. Deficient conditions of the safety zone of the San Felipe airfield, with an irregular, uneven and waterlogged surface, which contributed to cause or aggravate the damage to the aircraft. Non-observance by the San Felipe aerodrome administration of the recommendations issued in the Final Accident Investigation Report COL-18-28-GIA, occurred at the same aerodrome in 2018, due to a foreign object on the runway.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Aerocivil Report number: COL-22-21-DIACC Status: Investigation completedDuration: 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: www.semana.com   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

During the approach the first officer selected the landing gear down, however there was no movement from the landing gear and no gear lights illuminated. The flight crew followed the QRH procedures and manually lowered the landing gear, and observed three green lights, indicating the gear was down and locked. The flight returned to CYMO, and the passengers were briefed on the situation and a landing was performed on runway 24. During touchdown, the flight crew heard an unusual noise from the left main gear location and felt the left wing begin to drop. The left main gear green indicator light also extinguished. The captain immediately aborted the landing, applied engine power, and became airborne, reportedly without any other parts of the aircraft coming into contact with the runway. The flight crew decided to divert to Timmins Victor M. Power Airport (CYTS), ON, a main base for the operator with emergency services, since the aircraft had sufficient fuel and VFR conditions existed throughout the route.

The pilot suffered fatal injuries. The aircraft departed Salt Lake City International Airport, Utah (SLC) at 07:00 hours local time (13:00 UTC) on a cargo flight to BYI.  The pilot aborted the first approach to runway 20 at BYI at 08:11. The pilot executed the published missed approach procedure and reported over IREME. The controller then cleared the pilot for another RNAV approach to runway 20. After the pilot reported that she had crossed the initial approach fix, the controller approved a change to BYI advisory frequency. According to a witness, the aircraft descended out of the clouds and then immediately went into a steam cloud, which was produced from a set of six smokestacks located on the roof of a processing plant. The witness heard the engine increase in sound and saw the nose lift shortly before the airplane struck the smokestack and descend to the rooftop. The aircraft crashed 700 m north-east of the threshold of runway 20. At the time of both approaches, visibility at the airport was limited due to snowfall. PROBABLE CAUSE: The pilotâs failure to maintain altitude during an instrument approach, which resulted in a descent below the approach path and impact with a vent stack. Also causal was the failure of the processing plant to correctly paint the vent stacks, which had been determined by the FAA to be a hazard to navigation due to their proximity to the landing approach path. Contributing to the accident was the likely distraction/illusion/obscuration created by steam from the processing plant, which intermittently obscured the runway.METAR: 14:01 UTC / 08:01 local time: KBYI 131401Z AUTO 20008KT 2 1/2SM -SN BR BKN026 OVC033 M03/M05 A2996 RMK AO2 P0000 T1028105014:10 UTC / 08:10 local time: KBYI 131410Z AUTO 19008KT 1SM -SN BR BKN023 OVC028 M03/M05 A2996 RMK AO2 P0000 T1033105014:40 UTC / 08:40 local time: KBYI 131440Z AUTO 21008KT 2 1/2SM -SN BKN030 OVC047 M03/M06 A2997 RMK AO2 P0000 T10281056Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: WPR22FA151 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: newsradio1310.com  kmvt.com  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates31-May-2024 07:20 ASN Updated [Narrative, ]12-Jun-2024 11:39 ASN Updated The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Runway 11 had a Landing Distance Available (LDA) of 1400 metres. The aircraft touched down on the runway just before the 1000 ft mark (c. 300 m). Normal braking began shortly after the aircraft touched down on the runway. The PF began the go around procedure and advanced the power levers to the TO/GA position. Shortly afterwards the PF returned the power levers to the idle position, continued applying the maximum brake and then activated the emergency brake (EPB). The aircraft travelled approximately 55 m over the stopway, coming to a stop outside the paved area.  Contributing factors. - Application of controls - contributed. The use of the emergency brake was inadequate, as it disabled the anti-skid and caused the wheels to lock, which worsened the aircraft's braking capacity, leading to the runway excursion. - Airport infrastructure - undetermined. It was not possible to determine the influence of aspects relating to the adherence conditions of the SIRI runway, provided mainly by friction and surface texture, on the runway excursion. - Pilot judgement - contributed. There was inadequate judgement in the use of the EPB, which deactivated the anti-skid system and allowed the wheels to lock, reducing braking efficiency and contributing to runway excursion. - Other/Legislation - undetermined. It is possible that the lack of a specific regulation assigning criteria for the operation and maintenance of registered aerodromes may have contributed to the occurrence, as there was no way to measure the adherence of the runway, since it was not required in the legislation.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CENIPA Report number: A-049/CENIPA/2022 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 12 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: CENIPA  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates08-Feb-2024 17:53 ASN Updated [Time, Operator, Location, ]01-May-2024 09:05 ASN Updated [Source, Damage, Narrative, Category, Accident report, ]09-Jul-2024 07:07 ASN Updated 12-Feb-2025 09:41 ASN Updated Corrections or additions? ...

One of the three crew members suffered fatal injuries. The aircraft had been stuck at OZH following the Russian invasion of Ukrainen that started on February 24, 2022. Almost two months later, UR-UZB was to be ferried to Uzhgorod Airport (UDJ), away from the OZH due to fighting going on in the vicinity. In the 90 days prior to the accident, the captain had just flown for 85 minutes while the copilot and flight engineer had not made any flights. Causes: The cause of the aviation incident (collision of an airworthy aircraft with an obstacle) was the decision of the captain to carry out the flight under Visual Flight Rules (VFR) conditions in foggy weather at a critically low altitude, leading to the loss of visual contact with the ground, uncontrolled increase in speed, and the aircraft colliding with a power transmission line. Contributing Factors: 1. The flight crew's failure to decide to switch to instrument flight and climb to a safe flight altitude when encountering weather conditions that did not meet the visual meteorological flight conditions. 2. Likely use of altimeters by the flight crew to maintain flight altitude in meters when the altimeter mode was set to indicate altitude in feet. 3. The decision of the flight crew to fly at critically low altitudes with the radio altimeter and GPWS turned off. 4. The flight crew's failure to follow the departure procedure from the aerodrome area under VFR, which was discussed in detail by the flight crew during pre-flight briefings. 5. Deterioration of weather conditions after takeoff. 6. Low crew resource management (CRM) skills. 7. Retraction of flaps in a turn at an altitude lower than recommended and at a speed higher than recommended for the An-26 aircraft. 8.

The pilot was not injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135 on-demand air-cargo flight. The pilot reported no difficulties during the flight or landing. While taxing the airplane after landing, the green right landing gear position indicator light extinguished, and the red gear handle light illuminated. The pilot glanced over to the circuit breaker panel and noted that the landing gear control circuit breaker had tripped. After parking the airplane for refueling, he notified his company maintenance control group about the issue and was advised to not reposition the airplane after refueling. The pilot waited about 20 minutes for weather to clear before exiting the airplane. As the pilot prepared to exit, the right main landing gear collapsed and the airplaneâs right wing impacted the ground, resulting in substantial damage. Metallurgical examination of the separated fracture surface on the right landing gear drag leg support fitting revealed an area of fatigue in a machined radius adjacent to the center lug of the drag leg support. The remainder of the fracture exhibited features consistent with overload failure. An additional crack was found in the machined radius on the opposite side of the center lug. This portion of the part had not completely separated. Exposure of the crack revealed the existence of a fatigue crack in about the same area as the first crack, with overload signatures outside of the fatigue area. The airplane maintenance manual indicated that the subject part was to be cleaned and visually inspected at least every 7,500 cycles or every 5 years, whichever occurred first. Maintenance records indicated that the part had accumulated 762 cycles since the most recent inspection 23 months before the accident. After the accident, the operator examined the drag leg support fittings on their fleet of 9 other airplanes of the same model. Of the 18 fittings examined, 14 were found to be cracked. Of the 14 cracked fittings, 11 could only be detected using dye penetrant inspection, and could not be detected solely by visual inspection.  Probable Cause: A right main landing gear collapse due to fatigue failure of the landing gear drag leg support fitting.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN22LA188 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=105033  https://flightaware.com/live/flight/N699CZ History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  21 June 2008 N99NN Skydive Factory 1 near Bowling Green Municipal Airport (H19), MO non Location  Images: Photo: FAA Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates15-May-2022 05:06 Captain Adam Added 29-May-2022 11:39 Captain Adam Updated [Time, Phase, Narrative, Category, ]14-Mar-2024 19:27 Captain Adam Updated [Location, Source, Narrative, Accident report, Photo, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The pilot was flying the last rotation of the day, when at approximately 3,800 m, the low fuel level warning light lit up red. The pilot asked the 18 skydivers to jump as quickly as possible. The passenger voluntarily remained on board.  A minute later, once the drop was complete, the pilot began the descent. During this, the engine stopped. The pilot lengthened his trajectory so as not to interfere with the parachutists. He extended the flaps in landing configuration, but did not feather the propeller to avoid, according to him, a landing that took too long. On final, finding himself low on the glide path, he retracted the flaps hoping to reduce drag and thus be able to reach the runway. The aircraft lost lift and immediately sank, then touched down in a field before coming to rest in a ditch. Contributing factors: The following factors may have contributed to the forced landing short of the runway: - the decision to carry out the parachute-drop flight despite the low fuel level warning lights lighting up as soon as the engine was started, and the fuel quantities read on the gauges being less than the minimum quantity for carrying out this type of flight with this operator; - the lack of feathering of the propeller after engine shutdown, which resulted in additional drag and penalized the descent gradient; - the retraction of the flaps on final, resulting in a significant loss of lift.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Report number: BEA2022-0183 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: BEA   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot-in-command (PIC) was the pilot monitoring (PM) in the left seat, and the co-pilot was the pilot flying (PF) in the right seat and the second pilot was in the fourth cockpit seat (behind the left seat) as an observer. Investigation Conclusions As the aircraft accelerated to near V1 speed (145 knots),  while the co-pilot was holding the left rudder to maintain the direction  during the takeoff roll, the captain was distracted by items falling and lost the monitoring of the aircraft's status, and unconsciously held the left rudder which resulted in an unintended left deviation of the aircraft's direction.  After noticing the deviation, the crew did not execute the standard callouts, and the captain reduced the throttle to abort the takeoff. Due to the combined effects of maximum braking force and inertia, the crew was unable to correct effectively, causing the aircraft to veer off the runway at high speed (approximately 127 knots). After veering off the runway, the nose landing gear collided with and broke upon impact with a manhole cover and taxiway shoulder on the left side of runway 03. The aircraft continued forward due to inertia and struck an open drainage ditch 120 meters west of the runway centerline, causing the engines and main landing gear to detach. The aircraft belly touched the ground, and the aircraft caught fire and emitted smoke. Based on the extent of injuries and aircraft damage, this incident constitutes a general aviation accident caused by human error from the crew.METAR: 00:00 UTC / 08:00 local time: ZUCK 120000Z 08002MPS CAVOK 22/20 Q1010 NOSIG01:00 UTC / 09:00 local time: ZUCK 120100Z 09003MPS CAVOK 23/18 Q1010 NOSIG23:00 UTC / 07:00 local time: ZUCK 112300Z VRB01MPS CAVOK 20/20 Q1010 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: CAAC Report number: SWSW_AAR_2022_01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources: CAAC (Southwestern).

The pilot and three passengers were seriously injured. The aircraft sustained substantial damage. The pilot reported that during the takeoff roll from Yakutat Airport, he applied takeoff engine power and about 2 seconds later attempted to raise the tail of the airplane by applying forward elevator. He said that the tail came up slightly, but it subsequently settled back to the runway. He thought this was unusual but attributed it to an aft loaded airplane, applied additional nose down trim and departed without incident.  While enroute he stated that the tail of the airplane seemed to move up and down which he attributed to turbulence. Upon arrival at Dry Bay Airport he entered a left downwind for runway 23. At an altitude of about 600 ft, he reduced engine power and extended the flaps to 10Â° abeam the end of the runway. He turned base leg about half a mile from the approach end of the runway and slowed the airplane to 80 mph. While turning final he noticed the airplane seemed to pitch up, so he applied full nose down pitch trim and extended the flaps an additional 10Â°. On short final he applied full flaps, and the airplane abruptly pitched up to about a 45Â° angle. He stated that he applied full nose down elevator, verified the pitch trim, and reduced the power to idle. When the airplane was about 300 ft above ground level, the airplane stalled, broke slightly to the left and entered about a 45Â° nose down dive. After allowing the airplane to gain airspeed, he applied full back elevator. The airplane consequently impacted forested terrain near the approach end of runway 23 at an elevation of about 18 ft, which resulted in substantial damage to the fuselage, wings, and empennage. Probable Cause: The pilotâs failure to determine the actual weight and balance of the airplane before departure, which resulted in the airplane being operated outside of the aft center of gravity limits and the subsequent aerodynamic stall on final approach. Contributing to the accident was the Federal Aviation Administration's failure to require weight and balance documentation for 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135 single-engine operations.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ANC22LA035 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: adn.com  kinyradio.com  alaskasnewssource.com   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight was a regularly scheduled passenger flight from George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH), Houston, Texas. As a result of the turbulence, one flight attendant experienced a serious injury to their wrist. The aircraft received no damage and continued to its destination without further incident.  As stated by the first officer, dispatch remarks for this flight included a forecast for light to moderate turbulence over VORTACs BUM  - JOT between FL310 - 390. The captain conducted a pre-departure briefing with the flight attendants which included the possibility of experiencing turbulence. About two hours into the flight, two flight attendants were in the last three rows of the aft cabin conducting in-flight service when light turbulence commenced. The two flight attendants decided to âbring the cart back into the galley to finish the service.â As they were pushing back into the galley, the turbulence intensified, and one of the two flight attendants asked the other to sit down in their jump seat while the other set the brake on the cart. As the flight attendant was securing the cart, the captain made an announcement asking the flight attendants to take their seats. At that time, the flight attendant who was securing the cart lost their footing and fell back where the other flight attendant had taken their seat. The seated flight attendant attempted to brace the falling flight attendant and injured their wrist.  The captain stated that this instance of turbulence lasted about 15 seconds. In addition, he reported that that the seatbelt sign had been on for five minutes prior to this moderate turbulence as the aircraft flew through light turbulence earlier in the flight. The injured flight attendant was treated by an onboard doctor, and the flight proceeded to its destination without further incident. Upon arrival to Toronto, paramedics met the airplane.

The pilot-in-command stated that during the take-off run, the power was set for take-off at 1800 feet/pounds (lbs) of torque (TG) whilst the aircraft was still stationary with the brakes on. The flaps were configured for take-off/approach. Thereafter, the pilot-in-command released the brakes and proceeded with the take-off roll on runway 07. The aircraft continued with the take-off roll and the co-pilot made a 60 knots (kt) call. During this time, the aircraft rolled onto an uneven surface, which caused the aircraft to bounce and, as a quick resolve to prevent the nose wheel from slamming down hard on the ground, the pilot applied a slight back pressure on the control column. Following the bounce, the aircraft landed on its main wheels. Shortly thereafter, the aircraft experienced another unexpected bounce and was airborne in a high-nose attitude, and soon after, descended back onto the runway and veered off to the left-side. The pilot-in-command had the back pressure still applied, and he did not push the control column forward to make the wheels stick on the ground. This resulted in a premature take-off. To prevent the aircraft from veering off, the pilot applied the right rudder to bring the aircraft back on the runway, but the aircraft kept yawing to the left with a slight left roll. He further stated that he did not attempt to abort take-off as the aircraft was no longer above the runway.  The pilot-in-command reported that a decision to continue with the flight was taken, but due to the aircraftÂs speed that was below the required rotational (Vr) speed, a stall warning light illuminated, followed by an aural warning. A full right rudder was applied but the aircraft continued to yaw to the left. The aircraft stalled and later collided with the tree before it impacted the ground. It then skidded for approximately 350m before it hit a duiker/buck, which was fatally wounded. Probable cause: Loss of control during take-off as a result of an early rotation, causing a couple of bounces followed by a stall before the aircraft veered off to the left-side of the runway and, subsequently, crashed.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CAA S.A.

All 22 occupants suffered fatal injuries. The flight was the first of five Tara Air flights from Pokhara to Jomsom that day and scheduled to depart at 06:15 hours.  The flight was delayed because the Lete Pass on the route was covered up with clouds. The Twin Otter finally departed at 09:55, after two aircraft of Summit Air had departed for Jomsom.  9N-AET was supposed to take-off as the second flight but the captain seemed hesitant to commence  the flight due to a weather report from the first Summit Air flight that, the en-route weather was not favorable for VFR flights and critical around LETE and TATOPANI. The cockpit voice recording revealed that someone, either ground staff or some intimate passenger to the crew, advised the PIC strongly to conduct the flight. The aircraft took off from Pokhara from runway 04. The Tower controller instructed to ""report 5 DME northwest runway 04"". Then after departure the aircraft turned left to maintain a heading of 345 and planned to join heading 305 degree towards Ghodepani. After four minutes, flight 197 reported, ""Now on course... 6000 climbing and ETA Jomsom 32"" (0432 UTC). At 04:21 UTC flight 197 reported to Pokhara Tower as position approaching Ghodepani 12000 climbing for 12500.  After 6 Seconds ATC Pokhara asked flight 197, ""confirm would like to change level and TRA 197 replied, ÂNo Ma'am we have crossed Ghodepani and like to be onÂ. Pokhara Tower  instructed, ÂTara 197 contact Jomsom Tower 122.5Â CVR recordings show that after flight 197 crossed Ghodepani, the PIC was not comfortable with the en-route weather. However, the flight was continued following the advice of the preceding Summit Air flight. At 04:26 UTC, flight 197 made the first contact with Jomsom AFS and reported its position to which Jomsom Tower conveyed the prevailing weather as ""Wind South Westerly up to 30 kts, QNH 1019, Temp 18Âº"". The PIC of flight 197 reconfirmed twice if the wind was maximum, up to 30 kts and currently South Westerly 25 kts. The crew was discussing about the bad weather being  encountered and the PIC himself voiced his dissatisfaction about the behavior of other pilots who conduct VFR flights in such unfavorable weather. The CVR recordings reveal that the aircraft was encountering clouds and the PIC was trying his best to remain clear of the clouds.  The PIC was searching for light and brighter areas and adamantly heading towards it. The aircraft was maintaining 12000 ft and was in a climbing attitude.  During the continuous attempts of crew to avoid the clouds with Terrain Avoidance and Warning System (TAWS) inhibited, the aircraft struck rocky terrain at an altitude of 4050 meters AMSL at Sanusare Mountain.  The cockpit voice recoerder readout showed that the aural GPWS warning, a function of TAWS, was triggered approximately 3 seconds prior to the impact. However, there was no aural warning of enhanced Forward Looking Terrain Alert (FLTA), Premature Descent Alert (PDA), and Imminent Terrain  Impact (ITI) Alert/Warning function of TAWS. Further investigation of tht TAWS showed that it was configured to use GPS altitude, however no data was received by the system. This was likely caused by the misconfiguration of the RS-232 output format from the Garmin GPS receiver. As a result Corrected Barometric Altitude (CBA), computed by the Air Data Computer (ADC), was the only altitude input. In order to compute a reliable CBA, a regional barometric pressure setting must be entered into the ADC. This had not been done, so during the previous flights the CBA was off by 73 to 866 feet. Due to an overabundance of nuisance alerts, the TAWS was inhibited. Probable Cause: The probable cause of this accident was the flight crew's failure to monitor and maintain the proper course while inadvertently flying in IMC conditions with the aircraft Terrain Avoidance and Warning System [TAWS] inhibited which resulted into a CFIT accident. Contributing factors: 1. The flight crew's failure to follow the SOP of company 2. The aircraft flight operation with TAWS inhibited during deteriorating en-route weather condition. 3. Loss of situational awareness of crew 4. Deteriorating en-route weather 5. Less experienced copilot for that sector and high crew gradient 6. Poor CRM during the flight 7. The whole cockpit duties [both PF and PM] were undertaken by the PlC, which likely impaired his performance. 8.

The pilot in training was fatally injured and the pilot was seriously injured.  The pilots were performing skydiving flights while the right-seated pilot was training the left-seated pilot on the operation. The pilots completed six flights without incident and completed the drop of the skydivers on the accident flight normally. The right-seated pilot could not completely recollect the minutes leading up to the accident due to his injuries. He did recall that airplane was descending as expected with the power at idle. The recorded ADS-B data revealed that after turning onto final approach, the airplane then completed a right 360Â° turn presumably because the altitude was too high. The right-seated pilot attempted to increase the power by slightly nudging the throttle forward and thought the engine power did not increase as expected.  A performance study revealed that in the last 70 seconds of recorded data, the airplane underwent a series of speed and thrust oscillations consistent with a pilot increasing and then decreasing the power lever. The right seat pilot recalls aiming for an open dirt field and observing a bermÂ in the immediate flight path. In an effort to avoid the berm, he maneuvered the airplane into a right turn. The airplane landed short of the runway, resulting in a collision with the berm. The engine was producing power at the time of impact. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.  The right-seated pilot was in the process of training the left-seated pilot and stated that he took over the controls during the final approach. It is unknown when he took over the controls, so it is unknown which pilot was at the controls during the speed oscillations. The right-seated pilot likely took over the controls too late and the airplane impacted the terrain. The left-seated pilot's ability to hear the changes in engine power might have been hindered because she was listening to music through her headset at an elevated decibel level.  The airplane was modified by a Supplemental Type Certificate that replaces the original Pratt & Whitney PT-6 turbine engine with a Honeywell TPE331 turbine engine. The TPE331 engine's characteristics are such that if the airplane is on final approach with the power near idle, the throttle sensitivity (change in thrust per unit of power lever movement) increases around the transition between the propeller-governing and underspeed-governing modes of the engine, which corresponds to a zero-thrust condition. Near this transition point, small movements of the power lever (about Â¼  to Â½ inch of deflection) can result in relatively large thrust changes that can surprise pilots inexperienced with this behavior and result in pilot-induced oscillations (PIO). Given the thrust oscillations observed shortly before the end of the ADS-B data, it is likely that the left-seated pilot was at the controls and experienced such a PIO on a short final approach to land. Probable Cause: The right-seated pilot's failure to correct the left-seated pilot's mismanagement of the engine thrust, which resulted in undesired speed and thrust oscillations during the final approach and a subsequent descent into terrain.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: WPR22FA197 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB WPR22FA197  flightaware.com History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  3 January 1997 C-FTZF Nakina Outpost Camps & Airservice 0 Nakina Airport, ON (YQN) sub 21 July 2016 N7581F Skydive Twin Cities 0 Baldwin Airport, WI sub Runway excursion Location  Images: Photo: NTSB Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates20-Jul-2024 09:18 ASN Update Bot Updated [Time, Operator, Other fatalities, Phase, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, Category, ]20-Jul-2024 09:25 ASN Updated [Operator, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, ]20-Jul-2024 09:26 ASN Updated [Photo, ]20-Jul-2024 09:27 ASN Updated Corrections or additions? ...

The pilot was not injured. The aircraft sustained substantial damage to the left wing. The pilot reported that he planned to refuel the skydiving jump airplane after his third flight of skydivers and experienced about 10 minutes of loading delays with the third flight of skydivers. Then, while climbing, he was Âdelayed a few minutesÂ because of traffic in the area. He stated that he was not sure when the low fuel light illuminated, but that on his descent back toward the airport after releasing the third load of skydivers, the red ÂReservoir Fuel LowÂ annunciator illuminated. About 8,000 ft mean sea level, the engine lost all power due to fuel exhaustion. Subsequently, the pilot made an emergency landing at the airport; however, the airplane was Âfast and floated.Â The airplane touched down midfield, departed the end of the runway, and encountered a tree line, substantially damaging the left wing.

The flight attendant fell, hitting the lower back on the floor (sacrum fracture). The aircraft landed at Itami Airport at 13:55. Probable Cause: The JTSB concludes that as while the Belt Sign was off, the Aircraft encountered an airflow disturbance due to convective clouds and was shaken violently, which made the body of L2 float in mid-air when the L2 was squatting while working in the galley in the aft side of the Aircraft, resulting in getting out of balance to fall down on the floor and most likely sustaining the injury.  It is possible that the aircraft encountered airflow turbulence caused by convective clouds because of inadequate maneuvering to avoid them, and besides because it was difficult to detect developing convective clouds from onboard weather radar, the aircraft was likely not to be able to maintain an adequate distance from them.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JTSB Report number: AA2023-7 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: https://jtsb.mlit.go.jp/jtsb/aircraft/detail2.php?id=2324  https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/ja854a#2c62e521 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  25 April 2017 JA854A All Nippon Airways - ANA 0 Chubu Centrair International Airport/Nagoya (NGO/RJGG) min Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates11-Jun-2024 17:56 ASN Updated [Narrative, Accident report, ] Corrections or additions? ...

After takeoff the aircraft climbed to the cruising altitude flight level 210 (FL210) in accordance with the flight plan. During the descent to Venetia Mine, the first officer made a radio call to the aerodrome inspector on the VHF radio to inform him that they would be landing shortly. Thereafter, the aerodrome inspector went to perform a runway inspection. Once complete, the aerodrome inspector informed the flight that he had completed the runway inspection and that it was clear of foreign object debris and no wildlife was spotted close to the runway.  The crew stated that touchdown was normal on runway 08, however, during the landing roll at a ground speed of approximately 104 knots, with the propellers in the reverse thrust configuration (course pitch), a large bird (Kori Bustard) got airborne from the grass area next to the runway on the right side. The bird impacted the no.2 (right-side) propeller and one of the blades was severed. Some fragments from the blade penetrated the fuselage (third row of seats).  According to the crew, the bird strike caused the aircraft to shake and the number 2 engine to show an over temperature indication. The Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT) indication was over 750Â°C. The crew followed the engine shut down procedure while bringing the aircraft to a stop on the runway. After the aircraft had stopped, the captain, through the intercom, spoke with the passengers to check if they were harmed. The cabin crew member reported that nobody was injured after checking with the passengers. The crew then taxied the aircraft to the apron with only the left engine in operation. Once the engine was shut down, the passengers disembarked the aircraft. The aircraft sustained substantial damage. Probable Cause A bird strike on the propeller blade caused the overload fracture and separation failure of the blade. Contributory Factors: 1. Inadequate control of wildlife at the airfield. 2. Inadequate number of trained personnel to monitor and deter possible wildlife during aircraft operations.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CAA S.A.

About 11:48 local time JetBlueâs 1748 flight crew announced on the common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF) that they were leaving the ramp area to taxi to runway 10 for departure. A few seconds later, a Beechcraft B300 King Air, N350J, on an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan reported on the local CTAF that they were ""about 9 minutes out, for ten, coming in from the east, descending out of 17,000 ft"". The UNICOM operator at HDN responded to N350J stating that there were ""multiple aircraft inbound"" and winds were calm and provided the altimeter setting. After this exchange, the JetBlue crew began discussing the active runway and the multiple inbound airplanes using runway 10. About the time the JetBlue flight crew was starting their second engine and conducting engine checks, the King Air flight crew was contacting Denver ARTCC to cancel their IFR flight plan because they had visually acquired HDN and intended to land on runway 28. The Denver ARTCC controller acknowledged the IFR cancellation. The King Airâs flight crew subsequently announced, about 11:53 on CTAF that they were ""going to go ahead and land two eight"" and were ""straight-in two eight right now"". About 10 seconds later, the JetBlue flight crew announced on CTAF they were leaving the ramp area and were taxiing to runway 10 for departure. HDN UNICOM reported that multiple airplanes were inbound, and the winds were calm. While the JetBlue flight crew was performing an after-start checklist, the King Air announced on CTAF they were on a ""12-mile final two eight straight-in"". About 45 seconds later, the King Air asked on CTAF if anyone was about to depart from runway 10, and the JetBlue flight crew replied that they intended to hold on the taxiway near the end of runway 10 and wait for a clearance from Denver ARTCC. The King Air replied they were on a ""10-mile final, two eight, straight-in"". The JetBlue flight crew said ""alright, copy"" and that they would keep an eye out for them. About 11:55, the JetBlue flight crew received clearance to their destination after reporting to Denver ARTCC that they were ready for departure on runway 10 at HDN.  The JetBlue flight crew then announced on CTAF that they had received their clearance and would be departing on ""runway one zero"". Within 5 seconds, the King Airâs flight crew reported they ""had a king air on final two eight"" and that they ""had been calling."" JetBlueâs flight crew replied on CTAF that they thought the King Air was ""8 or 9 miles out"", to which the King Air replied they were 4 miles out, ""even less than that."" The JetBlue first officer, (pilot monitoring (PM)) stated that they looked for the airplane both visually and on their onboard traffic alert and collision avoidance system (TCAS) and did not see any air traffic. JetBlue flight crew acknowledged the King Air, looked for traffic approaching runway 10, and announced on CTAF that they were beginning their takeoff from runway 10 at HDN. The King Airâs flight crew replied that they were on a short final and ""I hope you donât hit us.""  According to ADS-B data, when JetBlue taxied onto runway 10 the King Air was on a reciprocal course 4.91 nautical miles from JetBlue. JetBlueâs crew increased thrust for takeoff about 11:57. About 11 seconds later, just prior to the 80 knots call out, the PM asked the PF if the King Air was on runway 28. The captain (pilot flying (PF)) asked ""is he?"" to which the PM said ""Yes, he is on 28, do you see him?"" to which the PF said no.  About 20 seconds after JetBlue started their take off on runway 10, the flight crew of the King Air asked JetBlue if they were going to do a quick turn-out, to which they replied, ""yes sir."" Concurrent to this conversation, JetBlueâs captain pitched the airplane up, 24 knots before rotation speed, to avoid the approaching King Air and subsequently struck the tail of the airplane on the runwayâs surface. He began a climbing right turn away from the traffic indicated on the TCAS. JetBlueâs captain and first officer both stated they never visually acquired the approaching King Air. According to ADS-B data, when JetBlue began its right turn after departure from runway 10 the King Air was on a reciprocal course with 2.27 nautical miles of separation between the converging airplanes.  While climbing to their cruising altitude, the flight crew discussed what had happened and consulted a jetBlue maintenance controller on their tailstrike. It was decided to divert to Denver for damage assessment.  The flight safely landed at Denver at 12:42 hours. Probable Cause: The captainâs rotation of the airplane pitch before the rotation speed on takeoff due to his surprise about encountering head on landing traffic, which resulted in an exceedance of the airplaneâs pitch limit and a subsequent tail strike. Contributing to the accident was the flight crewâs expectation bias that the incoming aircraft was landing on the same runway as they were departing from, and the conflicting trafficâs nonstandard use of phraseology when making position calls on the common traffic advisory frequency.METAR: 17:56 UTC / 10:56 local time: KHDN 221756Z AUTO 21005KT 8SM -SN FEW003 M11/M14 A3037 RMK AO2 SNB11 SLP364 P0000 60000 T11061144 11072 21144 51008 FZRANO19:23 UTC / 12:23 local time: KHDN 221923Z AUTO 19003KT 10SM BKN003 M06/M14 A3035 RMK AO2 FZRANOAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA22LA069 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Flightaware   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Control was lost during an attempted landing in a strong crosswind, following an ILS approach. The left wingtip struck the runway several times and remained in contact with the ground as the aircraft departed the paved surface into the grass area at the side of the runway. The aircraftâs stick pusher also activated, resulting in a hard landing that damaged the aircraftâs nose landing gear assembly. The flight then diverted to London-Gatwick Airport, where it landed at 00:51 UTC. Conclusion The aircraft yawed and rolled rapidly following a long float with insufficient airspeed in strong gusting wind conditions. Stick shaker activation was followed almost immediately by stick pusher activation, resulting in the aircraft landing on its nosewheel. A crosswind exceeding the commanderâs personal limit was forecast before departure. It would have been possible to delay departure or select an alternative arrival aerodrome with more favourable conditions.  The commander reflected that although there was an opportunity to discontinue the approach earlier, he had felt compelled to continue with the landing by a degree of plan continuation bias. Fatigue, commercial pressure and the nature of their interactions may have made the pilots more susceptible to this bias.METAR: 00:20 UTC / 00:20 local time: EGSS 310020Z AUTO 30013G24KT 9999 NCD 07/03 Q101600:50 UTC / 00:50 local time: EGSS 310050Z AUTO 29012KT 260V320 9999 NCD 07/02 Q101623:50 UTC / 23:50 local time: EGSS 302350Z AUTO 29013KT 250V330 9999 -RA SCT014/// SCT021/// BKN039/// //////TCU 07/04 Q1016Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: AAIB-27993 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Flightaware track  NTSB  Salvage tender   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft was operated on a mission that consisted of a multi-day cross country training and familiarization trip with three military aircrew members onboard. The accident happened on the first segment of the mission. The crew was cleared for the RNAV Z 25 instrument approach into the Thunder Bay Airport. The weather consisted of light winds and good visibility, with a ceiling at 2200 ft AGL. The approach proceeded normally and as the aircraft crossed through 600 ft AGL, the Pilot Flying elected to disconnect the autopilot and continue under manual control. Shortly after the aircraft crossed over the threshold of runway 25, the flying pilot reduced the two power levers to the idle position for landing. The aircraft experienced a yaw to the left and a significant drop of the left wing. The crew initiated an overshoot, however the aircraft continued to descend and the left wing impacted the runway surface. The aircraft progressed off the runway onto the snow-covered infield.

Conclusion: Most probably, the accident with the AN-2 RA-33599 aircraft occurred as a result of it reaching overcritical angles of attack and stall mode after performing takeoff with the maximum permissible weight and reduced power of the power plant. Most probably, the reduced power was caused by setting the PM-1 magneto switch to position ""1"" before takeoff instead of position ""1+2"" as stipulated by the flight manual. The most likely contributing factors were: - long flight interruptions by both crew members prior to the emergency flight; - shortcomings in training and interaction of crew members, as well as insufficient flight training, which resulted in loss of control over flight speed.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: life.ru  EMERCOM Russia   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane was operated as an instructional flight. The pilot had recently retired from flying large category transport airplanes. He was recently hired Air Flamenco and had received some ground school training on the BN-2A-9, the company mission, routes, and destinations. The accident occurred on the first landing of his first flight, and it was his first ever landing at the accident airport. The pilot stated that he entered a left downwind for landing on runway 13, and the estimated winds were 090Â° at 15 to 16 knots. The approach was flown about 80 knots and about 100 ft above the normal flight path, the stated to the NTSB. After touchdown the airplane ""leaned to the right"" and veered off the right side of the runway. The commercial pilot seated in the back stated it was not a hard landing, but it was ""harder than anything he had experienced before at that airport."" The right-hand wing was partially severed at the wing root and the airplane came to a stop in the grass on the left side of the runway. The right propeller blades displayed tip curling and the orange-painted wingtip displayed impact damage and longitudinal scraping and asphalt transfer. Probable Cause: The flight crewÂs failure to arrest the descent rate during the non-standard approach, which resulted in a hard landing and failure of the right-wing structure. Contributing was the flight instructorÂs selection of a challenging approach for initial training.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA22LA123 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: FAA   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The first leg was uneventful. The controller cleared the flight to back track on runway 06/24 to the threshold of runway 06 for takeoff. After having taxied about 200 m, the right engine apparently experienced a substantial periodic acceleration to a taxi speed of 36 knots, where a maximum speed of 10 knots is allowed by the manufacturer. After the right engine accelerated, there was a trajectory change to the left side of the runway centerline. The crew attempted to keep the aircraft within the runway, however, the crew's efforts did not have a positive result, allowing the aircraft to drift out of the runway into the safety zone. When the aircraft was over the safety zone, the crew attempted to use the braking system, however, the brakes were not effective due to the poor traction of the aircraft's wheels with the grass surface in the safety zone.  The aircraft continued to taxi to the left of the runway, until coming to a complete stop when the nose of the aircraft collided with a concrete wall bordering the airport.  The aircraft suffered substantial damage in the nose area, however, the stress concentration due to the impact was more evident in the left front fuselage area, structurally compromising a large part of the skin. Probable Cause Runway excursion, as a result of loss of directional control of the aircraft, when exceeding the maximum taxi speed allowed by the aircraft manufacturer. Contributing Factors Possible misuse of the nose wheel steering control system, nose wheel steering, by the crew when using it above the allowed speed, hindering directional control. Lack of standardization of the company's operating procedures, as it lacks its own taxiing policies and procedures. Probable self-imposed pressure from the crew, due to their desire to comply with the scheduled operation. Overconfidence, complacency, loss of situational awareness, and inadequate application of CRM by the crew, during a normal operation of the aircraft, which was apparently free of hazards.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Aerocivil Report number: COL-22-10-DIACC Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: Aerocivil   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were no injuries. According to the captain's statement to the NTSB, before departure, the airplane and runway were clear of any contaminants, all pre-takeoff checks were normal, and the flaps were set to 15Â°. During the takeoff clearance for runway 33, the air traffic control tower reported the wind was from 160Â° at 16 knots, gusting to 25 knots, and the instantaneous wind was from 180Â° at 10 knots. The captain performed a static takeoff, and the first officer made all of the callouts; airspeed alive, 80 knots, V1, and rotate. At rotation speed, the captain applied back pressure on the yoke; however, the airplane would not become airborne. The captain reported, ""the yoke did not have any air resistance or any pressure on it as we experience normally in Hawkers."" After a few seconds and without any indication the airplane would take off, the captain aborted the takeoff. The captain reduced the engines to idle, deployed the thrust reversers, and applied the brakes. The airplane subsequently departed the end of the runway into the snow.  Aspen Airport is located in a high mountain valley with mountainous terrain from 12500-14000 feet msl in near proximity to the airport. Instrument departures demand takeoff from runway 33 due to surrounding terrain. As N99AP was cleared for takeoff, ATC reported winds from 160 degrees at 16 knots, gusting to 25 knots. The Takeoff Runway Available (TORA) is 8006 feet (2440 m). Probable Cause and Findings The flight crewâs decision to takeoff in tailwind conditions that were consistently above the airplaneâs tailwind limitation, which resulted in a runway overrun following an aborted takeoff.  Contributing was the flight crewâs use of the instantaneous wind report for the decision to attempt the takeoff.METAR: 18:53 UTC / 11:53 local time: KASE 211853Z 16016G25KT 10SM FEW036 BKN060 01/M09 A2961 RMK AO2 PK WND 17027/1841 SLP988 T00111094Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN22LA130 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: www.aspentimes.com  www.aspendailynews.com  https://www.underwriterssalvagecompany.com/Listing/Details/733725/1999-Raytheon-Hawker-800-XP  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates01-Jul-2024 08:51 ASN Updated [Narrative, Accident report, ]08-Jul-2024 12:57 ASN Updated [Source, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot and passenger were seriously injured.  The pilot stated that the pilot-rated passenger was spending the day observing the skydiving operation. He had made three consecutive flights climbing to around 13,000 feet mean sea level (msl) to unload the skydivers. On the fourth flight, the pilot departed runway 25 and made a gradual climb to 12,700 ft msl as he circled back to the airport. The skydivers departed the airplane and the pilot initiated a steep, turning descent with the power at idle. He stated that the airplane was in âbeta modeâ but that the power lever was above the flight idle gate and the speed lever was left in the high position. The pilot stated that, while the airplane was on the base leg of the traffic pattern to runway 25, at an altitude about 4,000 ft msl and a descent rate of 4,500 fpm, he attempted to arrest the descent by adding power. The pilot further stated that despite his attempt to add power, the engine did not respond to movements of the power lever. He moved the propeller speed lever, which also had no effect. The pilot presumed that the engine had flamed out and attempted a restart. With the propeller still windmilling, he switched the ignition to âcontinuousâ and turned the boost pump on. He observed the torque gauge increase from 0% to 20%, but the engine was still unresponsive to movements of the power lever. He applied full nose-up trim and pulled the control yoke full aft against the stop, but the airplane would not maintain a level attitude. With the airplane in a noselow attitude, it collided with terrain about 1,400 ft short of the runway below). The pilot did not feather the propeller.  Probable Cause The pilotâs intentional inflight operation of the propeller in beta, which led to an aerodynamic lock, his inability to restore forward thrust, and subsequent collision with terrain.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: WPR22LA114 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: sandiegouniontribune.com  nbcsandiego.com History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  17 August 2008 F-OIJO Tropic Airlines 0 Saint BarthÃ©lÃ©my, French Antilles non Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates31-May-2024 07:30 ASN Updated [Aircraft type, Narrative, Accident report, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

After about 3 hours of total flight time, he proceeded to Pleasanton Municipal Airport (PEZ) to get fuel. During the descent, the ""left fuel low"" light illuminated, and shortly thereafter the ""reservoir fuel low"" light illuminated. The pilot ensured the fuel tanks, fuel pump, and igniters were on, and he diverted to a nearby private strip. Soon after, the airplaneÂs engine began to lose power. The pilot increased the throttle, but the engine lost total power. The airplane descended rapidly when it struck several trees and touched down on an upsloping field short of the runway. The wing spar in the airplaneÂs right wing sustained substantial damage.

The airplane was on approach to KHSA when the pilot attempted to extend the landing gear. During the gear extension process, the passengers heard a ""loud bang"" under the floor panels, and the pilot reported that the gear would not extend. The pilot diverted to GPT and attempted to extend the landing gear manually, which was unsuccessful as the system was jammed. The pilot landed with the gear retracted and the airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and empennage.

The flight crew reported they flew a normal flight and a stabilized approach in gusty wind conditions. Performance data indicated they would require about 3,000 ft of runway for landing on the 6,995 ft long runway, and they added 5 knots (kts) to the approach speed due to the gusts. Data indicated that the airplane landed in the touchdown zone and at an appropriate airspeed of 110 kts (104 kts groundspeed); however, the pilot's and co-pilot's application of brakes was unsuccessful in achieving sufficient braking action. The airplane departed the runway at a groundspeed of 58 kts and came to rest against a perimeter fence 450 ft past the runway. A witness stated the airplane landed long; however, his distance from the runway and his angle of view of the airplane may have prevented an accurate assessment.  Although the airplane flight manual states that if the brake system or antiskid fails, the pilot(s) are to attempt to pull the emergency brake, the pilots were unable to locate the emergency brake and instead pulled the parking brake. Although an examination of the braking system failed to find an anomaly, a performance study revealed that during the ground rollout the deceleration was primarily due to aerodynamic drag and free rolling 'unbraked' wheel friction for about 5,000 ft and that there was virtually no evidence of deceleration due to hydraulic or pneumatic wheel braking during the rollout. However, the pilots' inability to locate and use the emergency brake contributed to the insufficient braking. The crew failed to immediately recognize the issue and locate and utilize the emergency brake for supplemental braking authority. Probable Cause: And undetermined failure of the brake system. Contributing to the accident was the failure of the pilots to locate and operate the emergency brake control, which resulted in a runway excursion and collision with terrain and an object.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA22LA148 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources: www.wlox.com  FAA   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates04-Apr-2024 08:35 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The occupants suffered minor injuries. The aircraft was en route to an ice strip on Springpole Lake, Ontario. At 12:50, a snow squall began to move across CYXL, reducing ground visibility. The pilot taxied the aircraft to a position on the apron and waited for the fast-moving snow squall to pass. At 13:01, the pilot taxied the aircraft to runway 34 and took off in visual meteorological conditions. The aircraft climbed to approximately 1800 feet above sea level (ASL), then, once clear of the control zone, it descended to approximately 1600 to 1700 feet ASL, roughly 500 to 600 feet above ground level (AGL), to remain below the overcast ceiling. As the aircraft began to cross Lac Seul, Ontario, the visibility straight ahead and to the west was good. However, when the aircraft was roughly midway across the lake, it encountered turbulence and immediately became enveloped in whiteout conditions generated by a snow squall. The pilot turned his head to inspect the left wing and saw that ice appeared to be accumulating on the leading edge. He turned his attention back to the flight instruments and saw that the altimeter was descending rapidly. He then pulled back on the control column to stop the descent; however, within a few seconds, the aircraft struck the frozen surface of Lac Seul.

On 29 March 2022, the day before the accident, the pilot was flying the Cessna 208, registered as D-FLIC, from Costa dâArgento Airfield in Italy to the Siegerland Airport (EDSG) for maintenance. He flew over the SÃ¤ntis massif under visual flight rules at an altitude of approximately 8200 ft AMSL and on the same route as on the day of the accident, namely on the direct connecting line between the waypoints PELAD and DEGES provided for flights under instrument flight rules. On 30 March 2022 at 09:02 UTC, the pilot took off in the Cessna 208 from EDSG on a visual flight to the airport Arezzo (LIQB) in Italy. At 10:19 UTC, he passed the waypoint DEGES at 5400 ft AMSL. He was in radio contact with FIC Zurich, which had instructed him to remain under the Zurich terminal area (TMA). This airspace has a lower limit of 7500 ft AMSL at DEGES. After passing DEGES, the pilot flew as planned in the direction of waypoint PELAD and at 10:19:31 UTC the FIC informed him that the maximum permitted altitude for visual flights without authorisation to enter controlled airspace was now flight level 130: ""D-IC, report Bad Ragaz and now maximum flight level 130 possible"". The pilot replied with ""Roger, will report [unreadable] can you confirm start um higher?"" and wanted to make sure that he could now climb, which the FIC confirmed at 10:19:43 UTC with ""D-IC affirm, you may continue climb up to maximum flight level 130"". The pilot then replied: ""Roger, copied"". The rate of climb averaged around 550 ft/min. At 10:23 UTC, the aircraft collided with the northern flank of the GrÃ¼ehorn in the SÃ¤ntis massif at an altitude of 6800 ft AMSL on an unchanged flight path and flying in clouds.

The pilots and the two passengers sustained minor injuries.  According to the captain in the left seat, the airplane was established on a visual approach for landing on runway 23. The reported wind was from 340Â° at 3 knots gusting to 16 knots. The quartering tailwind was computed ""within limits,"" the thrust reversers were deployed at touchdown, and the airplane turned ""sharply to the right."" According to the captain, ""It felt unusual. Normal crosswind correction inputs made no difference, extreme inputs were made, and still no control was possible."" The airplane departed the right side of the runway, and the entire wing structure separated from the main fuselage, which continued for about 100 ft before coming to rest upright. The crew shut down the airplane and exited the main cabin door along with one passenger, while the second passenger egressed the airplane by the emergency exit. NTSB examination of track data and airport surveillance video revealed a nominal approach profile and that the airplane crossed the runway threshold about 120 knots groundspeed. About 9 seconds into the landing roll, the airplane turned sharply to its right. The airplane departed the runway, its left wingtip struck the ground, the entire wing structure (left wing/right wing/wingbox) separated from the airplane as one assembly, and the fuselage continued a short distance before it came to rest upright. The thrust reversers on each engine were deployed, and their positions were approximately matched.  The windsock in the foreground of the video was nearly parallel to the ground and pointed about 90Â° toward the runway and the airplane's right side. Probable Cause: The captainâs inadequate compensation for crosswind conditions, which resulted in a loss of directional control.METAR: 15:00 UTC / 11:00 local time: KMMU 021500Z 36009G14KT 10SM FEW250 06/M04 A301215:25 UTC / 11:25 local time: KMMU 021525Z 32006G14KT 10SM FEW250 07/M05 A301115:45 UTC / 11:45 local time: KMMU 021545Z 33007KT 10SM FEW250 07/M04 A3010Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA22LA175 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: eu.northjersey.com  ADS-B Exchange flight track   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates31-May-2024 07:22 ASN Updated [Narrative, Accident report, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft took off from SJO runway 07 at 15:36 UTC on a flight bound for Guatemala City. After ATC cleared the flight to FL220, the flight crew received a hydraulic system indication: ""HYDRAULIC QUANTITY"" followed by a second indication, this time for the left hydraulic system: ""HYDRAULIC SYSTEM PRESSURE (L ONLY)."" They also noticed that the left autopilot and yaw damper disengaged. From that point on, the captain took control of flying the aircraft while the first officer handled communications with ATC.  They performed the relevant procedures according to the checklist and decided to return to SJO. The flight crew prepared for an ILS approach for an emergency landing on runway 07. They knew they would not have autobrake, left reverser, rudder ratio, only some spoilers, and inoperative nose wheel steering.  During the approach, they extended the flaps and landing gear alternately. The captain adjusted the approach speed (Vapp) to 138-139 knots from the QRH's recommended 137 knots, with a Vref of 130 knots. ATC cleared them to land at 16:22 UTC with a reported wind from 240 degrees at 10 knots. On short final approach, the captain disconnected the autopilot and continued visually, executing a normal touchdown in the touchdown zone at 16:24 UTC. The landing was initially controlled by the flight crew, maintaining proper directional control with the rudder, differential brakes, right thrust reverser, and manual speed brake. However, at around 16:25 and nearing taxiway D, the aircraft began to turn right uncontrollably, resulting in an excursion off the runway at taxiway K to the south of the active runway.  There was no fire and the aircraft auffered major damage, as a result of the impact against the fence of an airport road and the rainwater collection slope. Contributing factors: 1. Fatigue and stress on the individual cables in the cross-section of the flexible hydraulic retraction hose of the L/H MLG down-locking actuator. 2. The probable inadvertent synchronised movement of the right Reverse Thrust Lever and left Engine Control Thrust Lever, as a reaction to muscle memory.METAR: 15:00 UTC / 09:00 local time: MROC 071500Z VRB04KT CAVOK 27/11 A3005 NOSIG16:00 UTC / 10:00 local time: MROC 071600Z 24008KT 200V270 CAVOK 27/16 A3005 NOSIG17:00 UTC / 11:00 local time: MROC 071700Z 24009KT 210V290 9999 FEW045 BKN250 27/19 A3003 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: DGAC Costa Rica Report number: CR-ACC-CO-02-2022 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: crprensa.com  nacion.com History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  11 February 2022 HP-2010DAE DHL Aero Expreso 0 Mexico City-Benito JuÃ¡rez International Airport (MEX/MMMX) unk 26 March 2022 HP-2010DAE DHL Aero Expreso 0 north of San JosÃ© non Loss of pressurization Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were no injuries, but the aircraft sustained substantial damage. The was operating a cargo flight from InÃ­rida (SKPD) to the San Felipe Airstrip (SKFP) with 2 crew and 12 passengers on board. The pilots carried out a visual approach to San Felipe runway 18. During the landing run, the left main gear tire exploded, and the aircraft pitched and rolled to the left. The pilot tried to control the aircraft's trajectory with brakes and engine differential power, as the directional control was not responding. The aircraft left the runway on the left side, towards the safety zone, which was flooded. The aircraft swung to the left, skidding to the right, causing the gear to fracture. The aircraft stopped and the crew shut down the engines and directed the evacuation of the passengers. Probable Cause: Lateral runway excursion, following loss of aircraft control, as a result of sudden loss of inflation pressure (blowout) of the left main landing gear tire, due to puncture of the tire by a ferrous rod (FOD) located on the runway surface. Contributing Factors Deficient safety conditions at the San Felipe airfield, due to the presence of FOD on the runway, as a consequence of the lack of an airfield maintenance program, the absence of perimeter fencing that favors the generation of foreign objects and the lack of an FOD prevention program. Deficient conditions of the safety zone of the San Felipe airfield, with an irregular, uneven and waterlogged surface, which contributed to cause or aggravate the damage to the aircraft. Non-observance by the San Felipe aerodrome administration of the recommendations issued in the Final Accident Investigation Report COL-18-28-GIA, occurred at the same aerodrome in 2018, due to a foreign object on the runway.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Aerocivil Report number: COL-22-21-DIACC Status: Investigation completedDuration: 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: www.semana.com   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight crew followed the QRH procedures and manually lowered the landing gear, and observed three green lights, indicating the gear was down and locked. The flight returned to CYMO, and the passengers were briefed on the situation and a landing was performed on runway 24. During touchdown, the flight crew heard an unusual noise from the left main gear location and felt the left wing begin to drop. The left main gear green indicator light also extinguished. The captain immediately aborted the landing, applied engine power, and became airborne, reportedly without any other parts of the aircraft coming into contact with the runway.

The pilot suffered fatal injuries. The aircraft departed Salt Lake City International Airport, Utah (SLC) at 07:00 hours local time (13:00 UTC) on a cargo flight to BYI.  The pilot aborted the first approach to runway 20 at BYI at 08:11. The pilot executed the published missed approach procedure and reported over IREME. The controller then cleared the pilot for another RNAV approach to runway 20. After the pilot reported that she had crossed the initial approach fix, the controller approved a change to BYI advisory frequency. According to a witness, the aircraft descended out of the clouds and then immediately went into a steam cloud, which was produced from a set of six smokestacks located on the roof of a processing plant. The witness heard the engine increase in sound and saw the nose lift shortly before the airplane struck the smokestack and descend to the rooftop. The aircraft crashed 700 m north-east of the threshold of runway 20. At the time of both approaches, visibility at the airport was limited due to snowfall. PROBABLE CAUSE: The pilotâs failure to maintain altitude during an instrument approach, which resulted in a descent below the approach path and impact with a vent stack. Also causal was the failure of the processing plant to correctly paint the vent stacks, which had been determined by the FAA to be a hazard to navigation due to their proximity to the landing approach path. Contributing to the accident was the likely distraction/illusion/obscuration created by steam from the processing plant, which intermittently obscured the runway.METAR: 14:01 UTC / 08:01 local time: KBYI 131401Z AUTO 20008KT 2 1/2SM -SN BR BKN026 OVC033 M03/M05 A2996 RMK AO2 P0000 T1028105014:10 UTC / 08:10 local time: KBYI 131410Z AUTO 19008KT 1SM -SN BR BKN023 OVC028 M03/M05 A2996 RMK AO2 P0000 T1033105014:40 UTC / 08:40 local time: KBYI 131440Z AUTO 21008KT 2 1/2SM -SN BKN030 OVC047 M03/M06 A2997 RMK AO2 P0000 T10281056Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: WPR22FA151 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: newsradio1310.com  kmvt.com  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates31-May-2024 07:20 ASN Updated [Narrative, ]12-Jun-2024 11:39 ASN Updated The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Runway 11 had a Landing Distance Available (LDA) of 1400 metres. The aircraft touched down on the runway just before the 1000 ft mark (c. 300 m). Normal braking began shortly after the aircraft touched down on the runway. The PF began the go around procedure and advanced the power levers to the TO/GA position. Shortly afterwards the PF returned the power levers to the idle position, continued applying the maximum brake and then activated the emergency brake (EPB). The aircraft travelled approximately 55 m over the stopway, coming to a stop outside the paved area.  Contributing factors. - Application of controls - contributed. The use of the emergency brake was inadequate, as it disabled the anti-skid and caused the wheels to lock, which worsened the aircraft's braking capacity, leading to the runway excursion. - Airport infrastructure - undetermined. It was not possible to determine the influence of aspects relating to the adherence conditions of the SIRI runway, provided mainly by friction and surface texture, on the runway excursion. - Pilot judgement - contributed. There was inadequate judgement in the use of the EPB, which deactivated the anti-skid system and allowed the wheels to lock, reducing braking efficiency and contributing to runway excursion. - Other/Legislation - undetermined. It is possible that the lack of a specific regulation assigning criteria for the operation and maintenance of registered aerodromes may have contributed to the occurrence, as there was no way to measure the adherence of the runway, since it was not required in the legislation.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CENIPA Report number: A-049/CENIPA/2022 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 12 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: CENIPA  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates08-Feb-2024 17:53 ASN Updated [Time, Operator, Location, ]01-May-2024 09:05 ASN Updated [Source, Damage, Narrative, Category, Accident report, ]09-Jul-2024 07:07 ASN Updated 12-Feb-2025 09:41 ASN Updated Corrections or additions? ...

One of the three crew members suffered fatal injuries. The aircraft had been stuck at OZH following the Russian invasion of Ukrainen that started on February 24, 2022. Almost two months later, UR-UZB was to be ferried to Uzhgorod Airport (UDJ), away from the OZH due to fighting going on in the vicinity. In the 90 days prior to the accident, the captain had just flown for 85 minutes while the copilot and flight engineer had not made any flights. Causes: The cause of the aviation incident (collision of an airworthy aircraft with an obstacle) was the decision of the captain to carry out the flight under Visual Flight Rules (VFR) conditions in foggy weather at a critically low altitude, leading to the loss of visual contact with the ground, uncontrolled increase in speed, and the aircraft colliding with a power transmission line. Contributing Factors: 1. The flight crew's failure to decide to switch to instrument flight and climb to a safe flight altitude when encountering weather conditions that did not meet the visual meteorological flight conditions. 2. Likely use of altimeters by the flight crew to maintain flight altitude in meters when the altimeter mode was set to indicate altitude in feet. 3. The decision of the flight crew to fly at critically low altitudes with the radio altimeter and GPWS turned off. 4. The flight crew's failure to follow the departure procedure from the aerodrome area under VFR, which was discussed in detail by the flight crew during pre-flight briefings. 5. Deterioration of weather conditions after takeoff. 6. Low crew resource management (CRM) skills. 7. Retraction of flaps in a turn at an altitude lower than recommended and at a speed higher than recommended for the An-26 aircraft. 8. The complex emotional state of the crew during both preparation and execution of the flight due to combat actions conducted by the Russian Federation near the departure aerodrome. 9. Conducting the flight without meteorological support, which contradicts aviation regulations. 10. The absence of procedures for conducting flights under VFR at low and critically low altitudes for An-26 aircraft in the operator's manuals.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NBAAI Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Nexta  NBAAI   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot was not injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135 on-demand air-cargo flight. The pilot reported no difficulties during the flight or landing. While taxing the airplane after landing, the green right landing gear position indicator light extinguished, and the red gear handle light illuminated. The pilot glanced over to the circuit breaker panel and noted that the landing gear control circuit breaker had tripped. After parking the airplane for refueling, he notified his company maintenance control group about the issue and was advised to not reposition the airplane after refueling. The pilot waited about 20 minutes for weather to clear before exiting the airplane. As the pilot prepared to exit, the right main landing gear collapsed and the airplaneâs right wing impacted the ground, resulting in substantial damage. Metallurgical examination of the separated fracture surface on the right landing gear drag leg support fitting revealed an area of fatigue in a machined radius adjacent to the center lug of the drag leg support. The remainder of the fracture exhibited features consistent with overload failure. An additional crack was found in the machined radius on the opposite side of the center lug. This portion of the part had not completely separated. Exposure of the crack revealed the existence of a fatigue crack in about the same area as the first crack, with overload signatures outside of the fatigue area. The airplane maintenance manual indicated that the subject part was to be cleaned and visually inspected at least every 7,500 cycles or every 5 years, whichever occurred first. Maintenance records indicated that the part had accumulated 762 cycles since the most recent inspection 23 months before the accident. After the accident, the operator examined the drag leg support fittings on their fleet of 9 other airplanes of the same model. Of the 18 fittings examined, 14 were found to be cracked. Of the 14 cracked fittings, 11 could only be detected using dye penetrant inspection, and could not be detected solely by visual inspection.  Probable Cause: A right main landing gear collapse due to fatigue failure of the landing gear drag leg support fitting.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN22LA188 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=105033  https://flightaware.com/live/flight/N699CZ History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  21 June 2008 N99NN Skydive Factory 1 near Bowling Green Municipal Airport (H19), MO non Location  Images: Photo: FAA Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates15-May-2022 05:06 Captain Adam Added 29-May-2022 11:39 Captain Adam Updated [Time, Phase, Narrative, Category, ]14-Mar-2024 19:27 Captain Adam Updated [Location, Source, Narrative, Accident report, Photo, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The pilot was flying the last rotation of the day, when at approximately 3,800 m, the low fuel level warning light lit up red. The pilot asked the 18 skydivers to jump as quickly as possible. The passenger voluntarily remained on board.  A minute later, once the drop was complete, the pilot began the descent. During this, the engine stopped. The pilot lengthened his trajectory so as not to interfere with the parachutists. He extended the flaps in landing configuration, but did not feather the propeller to avoid, according to him, a landing that took too long. On final, finding himself low on the glide path, he retracted the flaps hoping to reduce drag and thus be able to reach the runway. The aircraft lost lift and immediately sank, then touched down in a field before coming to rest in a ditch. Contributing factors: The following factors may have contributed to the forced landing short of the runway: - the decision to carry out the parachute-drop flight despite the low fuel level warning lights lighting up as soon as the engine was started, and the fuel quantities read on the gauges being less than the minimum quantity for carrying out this type of flight with this operator; - the lack of feathering of the propeller after engine shutdown, which resulted in additional drag and penalized the descent gradient; - the retraction of the flaps on final, resulting in a significant loss of lift.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Report number: BEA2022-0183 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: BEA   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot-in-command (PIC) was the pilot monitoring (PM) in the left seat, and the co-pilot was the pilot flying (PF) in the right seat and the second pilot was in the fourth cockpit seat (behind the left seat) as an observer. Investigation Conclusions As the aircraft accelerated to near V1 speed (145 knots),  while the co-pilot was holding the left rudder to maintain the direction  during the takeoff roll, the captain was distracted by items falling and lost the monitoring of the aircraft's status, and unconsciously held the left rudder which resulted in an unintended left deviation of the aircraft's direction.  After noticing the deviation, the crew did not execute the standard callouts, and the captain reduced the throttle to abort the takeoff. Due to the combined effects of maximum braking force and inertia, the crew was unable to correct effectively, causing the aircraft to veer off the runway at high speed (approximately 127 knots). After veering off the runway, the nose landing gear collided with and broke upon impact with a manhole cover and taxiway shoulder on the left side of runway 03. The aircraft continued forward due to inertia and struck an open drainage ditch 120 meters west of the runway centerline, causing the engines and main landing gear to detach. The aircraft belly touched the ground, and the aircraft caught fire and emitted smoke. Based on the extent of injuries and aircraft damage, this incident constitutes a general aviation accident caused by human error from the crew.METAR: 00:00 UTC / 08:00 local time: ZUCK 120000Z 08002MPS CAVOK 22/20 Q1010 NOSIG01:00 UTC / 09:00 local time: ZUCK 120100Z 09003MPS CAVOK 23/18 Q1010 NOSIG23:00 UTC / 07:00 local time: ZUCK 112300Z VRB01MPS CAVOK 20/20 Q1010 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: CAAC Report number: SWSW_AAR_2022_01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources: CAAC (Southwestern).

The pilot and three passengers were seriously injured. The aircraft sustained substantial damage. The pilot reported that during the takeoff roll from Yakutat Airport, he applied takeoff engine power and about 2 seconds later attempted to raise the tail of the airplane by applying forward elevator. He said that the tail came up slightly, but it subsequently settled back to the runway. He thought this was unusual but attributed it to an aft loaded airplane, applied additional nose down trim and departed without incident.  While enroute he stated that the tail of the airplane seemed to move up and down which he attributed to turbulence. Upon arrival at Dry Bay Airport he entered a left downwind for runway 23. At an altitude of about 600 ft, he reduced engine power and extended the flaps to 10Â° abeam the end of the runway. He turned base leg about half a mile from the approach end of the runway and slowed the airplane to 80 mph. While turning final he noticed the airplane seemed to pitch up, so he applied full nose down pitch trim and extended the flaps an additional 10Â°. On short final he applied full flaps, and the airplane abruptly pitched up to about a 45Â° angle. He stated that he applied full nose down elevator, verified the pitch trim, and reduced the power to idle. When the airplane was about 300 ft above ground level, the airplane stalled, broke slightly to the left and entered about a 45Â° nose down dive. After allowing the airplane to gain airspeed, he applied full back elevator. The airplane consequently impacted forested terrain near the approach end of runway 23 at an elevation of about 18 ft, which resulted in substantial damage to the fuselage, wings, and empennage. Probable Cause: The pilotâs failure to determine the actual weight and balance of the airplane before departure, which resulted in the airplane being operated outside of the aft center of gravity limits and the subsequent aerodynamic stall on final approach. Contributing to the accident was the Federal Aviation Administration's failure to require weight and balance documentation for 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135 single-engine operations.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ANC22LA035 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: adn.com  kinyradio.com  alaskasnewssource.com   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight was a regularly scheduled passenger flight from George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH), Houston, Texas. As a result of the turbulence, one flight attendant experienced a serious injury to their wrist. The aircraft received no damage and continued to its destination without further incident.  As stated by the first officer, dispatch remarks for this flight included a forecast for light to moderate turbulence over VORTACs BUM  - JOT between FL310 - 390. The captain conducted a pre-departure briefing with the flight attendants which included the possibility of experiencing turbulence. About two hours into the flight, two flight attendants were in the last three rows of the aft cabin conducting in-flight service when light turbulence commenced. The two flight attendants decided to âbring the cart back into the galley to finish the service.â As they were pushing back into the galley, the turbulence intensified, and one of the two flight attendants asked the other to sit down in their jump seat while the other set the brake on the cart. As the flight attendant was securing the cart, the captain made an announcement asking the flight attendants to take their seats. At that time, the flight attendant who was securing the cart lost their footing and fell back where the other flight attendant had taken their seat. The seated flight attendant attempted to brace the falling flight attendant and injured their wrist.  The captain stated that this instance of turbulence lasted about 15 seconds. In addition, he reported that that the seatbelt sign had been on for five minutes prior to this moderate turbulence as the aircraft flew through light turbulence earlier in the flight. The injured flight attendant was treated by an onboard doctor, and the flight proceeded to its destination without further incident. Upon arrival to Toronto, paramedics met the airplane.

The pilot-in-command stated that during the take-off run, the power was set for take-off at 1800 feet/pounds (lbs) of torque (TG) whilst the aircraft was still stationary with the brakes on. The flaps were configured for take-off/approach. Thereafter, the pilot-in-command released the brakes and proceeded with the take-off roll on runway 07. The aircraft continued with the take-off roll and the co-pilot made a 60 knots (kt) call. During this time, the aircraft rolled onto an uneven surface, which caused the aircraft to bounce and, as a quick resolve to prevent the nose wheel from slamming down hard on the ground, the pilot applied a slight back pressure on the control column. Following the bounce, the aircraft landed on its main wheels. Shortly thereafter, the aircraft experienced another unexpected bounce and was airborne in a high-nose attitude, and soon after, descended back onto the runway and veered off to the left-side. The pilot-in-command had the back pressure still applied, and he did not push the control column forward to make the wheels stick on the ground. This resulted in a premature take-off. To prevent the aircraft from veering off, the pilot applied the right rudder to bring the aircraft back on the runway, but the aircraft kept yawing to the left with a slight left roll. He further stated that he did not attempt to abort take-off as the aircraft was no longer above the runway.  The pilot-in-command reported that a decision to continue with the flight was taken, but due to the aircraftÂs speed that was below the required rotational (Vr) speed, a stall warning light illuminated, followed by an aural warning. A full right rudder was applied but the aircraft continued to yaw to the left. The aircraft stalled and later collided with the tree before it impacted the ground. It then skidded for approximately 350m before it hit a duiker/buck, which was fatally wounded. Probable cause: Loss of control during take-off as a result of an early rotation, causing a couple of bounces followed by a stall before the aircraft veered off to the left-side of the runway and, subsequently, crashed.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CAA S.A.

The Twin Otter finally departed at 09:55, after two aircraft of Summit Air had departed for Jomsom.  9N-AET was supposed to take-off as the second flight but the captain seemed hesitant to commence  the flight due to a weather report from the first Summit Air flight that, the en-route weather was not favorable for VFR flights and critical around LETE and TATOPANI. The cockpit voice recording revealed that someone, either ground staff or some intimate passenger to the crew, advised the PIC strongly to conduct the flight. The aircraft took off from Pokhara from runway 04. The Tower controller instructed to ""report 5 DME northwest runway 04"". Then after departure the aircraft turned left to maintain a heading of 345 and planned to join heading 305 degree towards Ghodepani. After four minutes, flight 197 reported, ""Now on course... 6000 climbing and ETA Jomsom 32"" (0432 UTC). At 04:21 UTC flight 197 reported to Pokhara Tower as position approaching Ghodepani 12000 climbing for 12500.  After 6 Seconds ATC Pokhara asked flight 197, ""confirm would like to change level and TRA 197 replied, ÂNo Ma'am we have crossed Ghodepani and like to be onÂ. Pokhara Tower  instructed, ÂTara 197 contact Jomsom Tower 122.5Â CVR recordings show that after flight 197 crossed Ghodepani, the PIC was not comfortable with the en-route weather. However, the flight was continued following the advice of the preceding Summit Air flight. At 04:26 UTC, flight 197 made the first contact with Jomsom AFS and reported its position to which Jomsom Tower conveyed the prevailing weather as ""Wind South Westerly up to 30 kts, QNH 1019, Temp 18Âº"". The PIC of flight 197 reconfirmed twice if the wind was maximum, up to 30 kts and currently South Westerly 25 kts. The crew was discussing about the bad weather being  encountered and the PIC himself voiced his dissatisfaction about the behavior of other pilots who conduct VFR flights in such unfavorable weather. The CVR recordings reveal that the aircraft was encountering clouds and the PIC was trying his best to remain clear of the clouds.  The PIC was searching for light and brighter areas and adamantly heading towards it. The aircraft was maintaining 12000 ft and was in a climbing attitude.  During the continuous attempts of crew to avoid the clouds with Terrain Avoidance and Warning System (TAWS) inhibited, the aircraft struck rocky terrain at an altitude of 4050 meters AMSL at Sanusare Mountain.  The cockpit voice recoerder readout showed that the aural GPWS warning, a function of TAWS, was triggered approximately 3 seconds prior to the impact. However, there was no aural warning of enhanced Forward Looking Terrain Alert (FLTA), Premature Descent Alert (PDA), and Imminent Terrain  Impact (ITI) Alert/Warning function of TAWS. Further investigation of tht TAWS showed that it was configured to use GPS altitude, however no data was received by the system. This was likely caused by the misconfiguration of the RS-232 output format from the Garmin GPS receiver. As a result Corrected Barometric Altitude (CBA), computed by the Air Data Computer (ADC), was the only altitude input. In order to compute a reliable CBA, a regional barometric pressure setting must be entered into the ADC. This had not been done, so during the previous flights the CBA was off by 73 to 866 feet. Due to an overabundance of nuisance alerts, the TAWS was inhibited. Probable Cause: The probable cause of this accident was the flight crew's failure to monitor and maintain the proper course while inadvertently flying in IMC conditions with the aircraft Terrain Avoidance and Warning System [TAWS] inhibited which resulted into a CFIT accident. Contributing factors: 1. The flight crew's failure to follow the SOP of company 2. The aircraft flight operation with TAWS inhibited during deteriorating en-route weather condition. 3. Loss of situational awareness of crew 4. Deteriorating en-route weather 5. Less experienced copilot for that sector and high crew gradient 6. Poor CRM during the flight 7. The whole cockpit duties [both PF and PM] were undertaken by the PlC, which likely impaired his performance. 8.

The pilot in training was fatally injured and the pilot was seriously injured.  The pilots were performing skydiving flights while the right-seated pilot was training the left-seated pilot on the operation. The pilots completed six flights without incident and completed the drop of the skydivers on the accident flight normally. The right-seated pilot could not completely recollect the minutes leading up to the accident due to his injuries. He did recall that airplane was descending as expected with the power at idle. The recorded ADS-B data revealed that after turning onto final approach, the airplane then completed a right 360Â° turn presumably because the altitude was too high. The right-seated pilot attempted to increase the power by slightly nudging the throttle forward and thought the engine power did not increase as expected.  A performance study revealed that in the last 70 seconds of recorded data, the airplane underwent a series of speed and thrust oscillations consistent with a pilot increasing and then decreasing the power lever. The right seat pilot recalls aiming for an open dirt field and observing a bermÂ in the immediate flight path. In an effort to avoid the berm, he maneuvered the airplane into a right turn. The airplane landed short of the runway, resulting in a collision with the berm. The engine was producing power at the time of impact. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.  The right-seated pilot was in the process of training the left-seated pilot and stated that he took over the controls during the final approach. It is unknown when he took over the controls, so it is unknown which pilot was at the controls during the speed oscillations. The right-seated pilot likely took over the controls too late and the airplane impacted the terrain. The left-seated pilot's ability to hear the changes in engine power might have been hindered because she was listening to music through her headset at an elevated decibel level.  The airplane was modified by a Supplemental Type Certificate that replaces the original Pratt & Whitney PT-6 turbine engine with a Honeywell TPE331 turbine engine. The TPE331 engine's characteristics are such that if the airplane is on final approach with the power near idle, the throttle sensitivity (change in thrust per unit of power lever movement) increases around the transition between the propeller-governing and underspeed-governing modes of the engine, which corresponds to a zero-thrust condition. Near this transition point, small movements of the power lever (about Â¼  to Â½ inch of deflection) can result in relatively large thrust changes that can surprise pilots inexperienced with this behavior and result in pilot-induced oscillations (PIO). Given the thrust oscillations observed shortly before the end of the ADS-B data, it is likely that the left-seated pilot was at the controls and experienced such a PIO on a short final approach to land. Probable Cause: The right-seated pilot's failure to correct the left-seated pilot's mismanagement of the engine thrust, which resulted in undesired speed and thrust oscillations during the final approach and a subsequent descent into terrain.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: WPR22FA197 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB WPR22FA197  flightaware.com History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  3 January 1997 C-FTZF Nakina Outpost Camps & Airservice 0 Nakina Airport, ON (YQN) sub 21 July 2016 N7581F Skydive Twin Cities 0 Baldwin Airport, WI sub Runway excursion Location  Images: Photo: NTSB Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates20-Jul-2024 09:18 ASN Update Bot Updated [Time, Operator, Other fatalities, Phase, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, Category, ]20-Jul-2024 09:25 ASN Updated [Operator, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, ]20-Jul-2024 09:26 ASN Updated [Photo, ]20-Jul-2024 09:27 ASN Updated Corrections or additions? ...

About the time the tug arrived, the crew said they felt the airplane move due to a ""hard connection"", but they were unaware of an airplane passing behind at that time. After the airplane was parked at the gate and passengers had disembarked, maintenance informed the flight crew of damage to the elevator, and it was determined to be from the ITA Airways A330 that had passed behind. The Air France flight crew said they tried to contact the Air Traffic Control Tower to stop the ITA Airways flight, but the conversation was lengthy, and the ITA Airways flight 611 took off without receiving timely notification of the collision. A controller then contacted AZ611, reporting: ""Another aircraft on the ground currently, Air France, said you hit them or something of that nature while you were taxiing. Did you experience any damage to the aircraft?"" The ITA Airways pilot responded: ""Negative, sir."" The flight continued to Rome, Italy, and landed normally.  EI-EJL resumed service after two days while F-GSPQ was ferried to Paris on July 12. Probable Cause: The ITA Airways flightcrewÂs misperception of the distance to maintain separation and safely pass the stopped Air France airplane.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA22LA135A Status: Investigation completedDuration: 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: www.lepoint.fr  flightradar24.com   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight departed Santo Domingo International Airport (SDQ), Dominican Republic , at 15:35. The aircraft was cleared for the ILS runway 09 at MIA and the crew reported that the approach was normal. The first officer stated to the NTSB that the landing was smooth, and they first touched down on the right main gear followed by the left main gear slightly right of centerline. The crew felt an increasing vibration on the left side of the airplane shortly after the left main gear touched down. During the landing roll out the left main gear collapsed, the airplane traveled to the left where it eventually departed the paved surface and impacted the runway 30 glide slope equipment shelter. During departure from the paved surface and impact with the steel and concrete shelter, the airplane's right main landing gear and nosewheel collapsed, and the fuel tanks were breached. Shortly after the airplane came to a stop, a post-crash fire began on the right wing. All 130 passengers and 10 crew evacuated the airplane, of which 4 passengers sustained minor injuries. Probable Cause: The structural failure of the left main landing gear downlock following ineffective shimmy dampening during the landing roll which caused the collapse of the left main landing gear, resulting in a runway excursion and post-flight fire.METAR: 20:53 UTC / 16:53 local time: KMIA 212053Z COR 05010G18KT 10SM FEW030 BKN250 30/19 A3008 RMK AO2 SLP187 CB DSNT SE AND SW MOV S T03000194 $21:53 UTC / 17:53 local time: KMIA 212153Z 05009G16KT 10SM FEW030 FEW045 BKN250 30/16 A3008 RMK AO2 SLP187 T03000161 $Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA22FA132 Status: Duration: 1 year and 10 monthsDownload report: Sources: wsvn.com  www.miamiherald.com  RED Air statement  NRSB   Location  Images: photo (c) FAA; Miami International Airport, FL (MIA); 21 June 2022; (publicdomain) photo (c) David Russell; Miami International Airport, FL (MIA); 29 April 2022 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates28-Apr-2024 08:36 ASN Updated [Narrative, ]28-Apr-2024 08:36 ASN Updated 17-May-2024 19:00 ASN Updated Corrections or additions? ...

The flight attendant fell, hitting the lower back on the floor (sacrum fracture). The aircraft landed at Itami Airport at 13:55. Probable Cause: The JTSB concludes that as while the Belt Sign was off, the Aircraft encountered an airflow disturbance due to convective clouds and was shaken violently, which made the body of L2 float in mid-air when the L2 was squatting while working in the galley in the aft side of the Aircraft, resulting in getting out of balance to fall down on the floor and most likely sustaining the injury.  It is possible that the aircraft encountered airflow turbulence caused by convective clouds because of inadequate maneuvering to avoid them, and besides because it was difficult to detect developing convective clouds from onboard weather radar, the aircraft was likely not to be able to maintain an adequate distance from them.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JTSB Report number: AA2023-7 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: https://jtsb.mlit.go.jp/jtsb/aircraft/detail2.php?id=2324  https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/ja854a#2c62e521 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  25 April 2017 JA854A All Nippon Airways - ANA 0 Chubu Centrair International Airport/Nagoya (NGO/RJGG) min Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates11-Jun-2024 17:56 ASN Updated [Narrative, Accident report, ] Corrections or additions? ...
