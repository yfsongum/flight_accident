Of the eight people on board, the pilot and four passengers sustained serious injuries, and three passengers sustained minor injuries. Visual meteorological conditions (VMC) prevailed at the Anaktuvuk Pass Airport at the time of the accident. The flight departed from the Fairbanks Airport, about 10:30, destined for Anaktuvuk Pass.  The pilot stated that he was flying along the John's River about 2,500 feet msl, 500 feet above ground level (agl) while en route to Anaktuvuk Pass Airport (AKP). About 10 miles from the airport, he began to climb to airport traffic pattern altitude and maintain a flight track on the east side of the river valley to conduct a straight-in approach to runway 2 at AKP. Although some ice was present on the windshield, the deice/anti-ice equipment was operating as designed, and the windshield hot plate remained free of contamination. He stated that due to the overcast skies and snow covered ground, a flat light condition was present. The aircraft impacted an area of snow-covered tundra, at an elevation of about 2,500 feet msl. The top of the ridge where the airplane impacted is at an approximate elevation of 3,000 feet msl. From the initial point of impact, the airplane traveled about 300 feet before coming to rest in an upright position. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and wings.  Immediately following the accident, a passenger utilized a cellular phone to call for rescue from Anaktuvuk Pass residents. About 20 minutes after the call, the airplane was located and rescue personnel began extricating passengers and transporting them via snow machine to Anaktuvuk Pass for medical attention.

The pilot performed the landing checklist, which included extending the landing gear when the airplane was about 7 miles from the destination airport. Upon contacting the control tower, he was informed that the airplane was number two to land and was provided a vector for sequencing. After about 4 minutes, the pilot was instructed to turn toward the airport and cleared to land. The pilot stated that during his preparation for a no flap landing, he forgot that he had retracted and not subsequently lowered the landing gear. During the landing flare, the control tower stated ""gear"" and he attempted to abort the landing; however, the airplane contacted the runway and slid to a stop, about 2,500 feet beyond the beginning of the runway. A fuel bladder leak resulted in a fire in the area of the left engine nacelle and substantial damage to the left wing. The pilot stated that he did not hear a landing gear warning horn prior to the accident. According to the airplane flight manual, the landing gear warning would activate intermittently with the gear not down below a certain power setting.

Both pilots were killed. The aircraft departed Oslo-Gardermoen Airport, Norway at 23:10 hours local time on a mail and package flight to TromsÃ¸, Norway.  The take-off, departure and climb to cruising altitude, flight level 330, were performed according to normal procedures. The flight was uneventful until one minute and 20 seconds before the impact. The event started at 00:19:20 hrs, one hour and ten minutes into the flight in night time conditions of darkness without moonlight, clouds or turbulence. The lack of external visual references meant that the pilots were totally dependent on their instruments which consisted of three independent attitude indicators. Suddenly a very fast increase in pitch was displayed on the left attitude indicator. The pilot in command, who was the pilot flying and seated in the left seat exclaimed a strong expression. The displayed pitch change meant that the pilot in command was subjected to a surprise effect and a degradation of spatial orientation. The autopilot was, most probably, disconnected automatically, a ""cavalry charge"" aural warning and a single chime was heard, the latter most likely as a result of miscompare between the left and right pilots' flying displays (PFD). Both elevators moved towards nose down and nose down stabilizer trim was gradually activated from the left control wheel trim switch. The airplane started to descend, the angle of attack and G-loads became negative up to -1 G. Both pilots exclaimed strong expressions and the co-pilot said ""come up"". About 13 seconds after the start of the event the crew were presented with two contradictory attitude indicators with red chevrons pointing in opposite directions. At the same time none of the instruments displayed any comparator caution due to the PFDs declutter function in unusual attitude. Bank angle warnings were heard and the maximum operating speed and Mach number were exceeded 17 seconds after the start of the event, which activated the overspeed warning. The speed continued to increase, a distress call was transmitted and acknowledged by the air traffic control and the engine thrust was reduced to flight idle. The crew was active during the entire event. The dialogue between the pilots consisted mainly of different perceptions regarding turn directions. They also expressed the need to climb. At this stage, the pilots were probably subjected to spatial disorientation. The aircraft collided with the ground one minute and twenty seconds after the initial height loss. Investigation revealed that the erroneous attitude indication on PFD 1 was caused by a malfunction of the Inertial Reference Unit (IRU 1). The pitch and roll comparator indications of the PFDs were removed when the attitude indicators displayed unusual attitudes. In the simulator, in which the crew had trained, the corresponding indications were not removed. During the event the pilots initially became communicatively isolated from each other. Factors as to cause and contributing factors: The accident was caused by insufficient operational prerequisites for the management of a failure in a redundant system. Contributing factors were: - The absence of an effective system for communication in abnormal and emergency situations. - The flight instrument system provided insufficient guidance about malfunctions that occurred. - The initial manoeuver that resulted in negative G-loads probably affected the pilots' ability to manage the situation in a rational manner. Factors as to risk The fact that fault descriptions regarding aircraft and its components are reported in a less detailed manner might imply that the faults will not be identified and corrected in an efficient way. This can in turn lead to a flight safety issue as, for instance, intermittent faults cannot always be detected by general tests.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: SHK Report number: SRL 2016:01e Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) Source: Swedish Accident Investigation Authority photo (c) Source: Swedish Accident Investigation Authority; January 2016 photo (c) Source: Swedish Accident Investigation Authority; January 2016 photo (c) Giuseppe Battioli; Oslo-Gardermoen Airport (OSL/ENGM) [LN]; 23 August 2015 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Both occupants died in the accident. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed in the area, and an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan was filed for the personal cross-country flight from Salt Lake City International Airport, Utah, about 09:50, with an intended destination of Tucson International Airport, Arizona. The pilot contacted the SLC departure controller at 0951:59 and reported that he was climbing through 7,500 ft mean sea level (msl) for 10,000 ft. The controller then cleared the pilot to climb to and maintain Flight Level 230 (FL230), and to delete speed restrictions; the pilot confirmed the clearance. At 0952:21, the controller instructed the pilot to maintain 14,000 ft, to delete all speed restrictions, and asked him what speed he was climbing at; the pilot confirmed the clearance and stated that he was climbing at 200 knots (kts). At 0955:01, while approaching 14,000 ft the pilot reported that he had a failure with his Flight Management System (FMS), that he was ""switching to NAV for a second,"" and would be exceeding the assigned altitude. This was followed by an unintelligible transmission. At 0955:16, the controller instructed the pilot to descend and maintain 14,000 ft and to fly his present heading. About 10 seconds later, the pilot advised the controller that he had an autopilot failure, and requested a climb to visual meteorological conditions. The controller instructed the pilot to climb and maintain FL180. At 0955:47, the pilot responded by confirming the climb to FL180. The controller then asked the pilot if he needed assistance. The pilot did not immediately respond, and the controller asked him a second time. At 0956:16, the pilot responded ""negative,"" saying that he was ""just trying to get to clear skies,"" and was climbing to FL180. The pilot stated that his ""number 2"" was working, and that his ""altitude"" had failed. The pilot concluded the transmission by saying, ""...so, uh, my number two is working, climbing to one eight thousand."" At 0956:32, the controller advised the pilot that traffic would be crossing above him at FL190, and that it was important that he level the airplane at FL180; the pilot replied, ""We'll be watching."" At 0956:45, the controller advised the pilot of two areas of light precipitation directly ahead of the airplane, and asked the pilot if he would need vectors to clear the weather. At 0956:59, the pilot responded that he would appreciate any vectors possible. Shortly thereafter, at 0957:06, the controller asked the pilot to ""...paint a picture for me of where you think the clearest skies would be. I can vector you wherever you need to go."" At 0957:12, the pilot replied that he was heading to TUS, his altitude would not hold, and that he was hand flying the airplane. About this time, radar showed the airplane beginning a right turn from its previously-established southerly heading to a southwesterly heading, though the airplane had neither been cleared to do so by the controller nor had the pilot informed the controller of the deviation. About 0957:20, the pilot transmitted that he would appreciate any vectors possible. About 15 seconds later, the controller advised the pilot that he was showing him at 17,500 ft, directed the pilot to fly his present heading, and stated that the airplane would be clear of the precipitation in about 4 miles. About 17 seconds later, the pilot transmitted, ""...ok, MAYDAY. I do need to get up higher. I am losing different instruments. I'd really like to get clear of weather."" At 0958:01, the controller issued the pilot a clearance to climb and maintain FL230, which the pilot confirmed. About 0958:26, the controller amended the previous clearance and instructed the pilot to climb to and maintain FL310, which the pilot initially confirmed, but shortly thereafter stated, ""...yeah. I can't even dial that in. Still climbing, passing twenty thousand, so I'm just going to be reading it out to be sure my second is operating correctly."" At 0958:46, the controller stated that he was showing the airplane climbing through 20,200 ft, and asked the pilot if he wanted to continue to TUS; the pilot replied, ""That is affirmative."" At 0958:53, when the airplane was at 20,700 ft, the controller issued the pilot a no-gyro turn to the left for vectors to the southeast; this occurred about 1 minute 41 seconds after the airplane had turned southwest. Radar data showed that the pilot initiated a right turn from a southwesterly heading at an altitude of 20,700 ft. At 0959:12, the airplane reached an altitude of 21,300 ft. msl, and was still in the right turn. At 0959:13, the controller stated, ""November one bravo x-ray. I show you in a right turn. Can you turn left?"" At 0959:17, while climbing out of 21,300 ft, the pilot replied that he was ""trying to climb."" About 0959:47, the controller advised the pilot that he had lost the airplane's altitude readout, and asked the pilot the airplane's altitude. There were no further transmissions received from the pilot. Between 0959:49 and 0959:58, the airplane descended from an altitude of 21,300 ft to 16,000 ft, with its rate of descent during this time increasing from 9,600 ft per minute (fpm) to 36,000 fpm. The airplane's wreckage was located in open, flat pasture ground, about 1 nautical mile southwest of Cedar Fort, Utah, and about 28 nm south-southwest of SLC. A survey of the accident site revealed that the linear debris path of wreckage extended for about 1 nm on a west to east orientation. Probable Cause: ""The pilot's loss of control due to spatial disorientation while operating in instrument meteorological conditions, which resulted in an exceedance of the airplane's design stress limitations, and a subsequent in-flight breakup. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's reported inflight instrumentation anomaly, the origin of which could not be determined during the investigation.""METAR: 09:53 UTC / 16:53 local time: KSLC 181653Z 13004KT 10SM -RA FEW030 BKN046 OVC060 03/01 A3009 RMK AO2 RAE01B51 SLP191 P0000 T0033000610:53 UTC / 17:53 local time: KSLC 181753Z 17005KT 10SM FEW030 BKN044 OVC065 04/01 A3008 RMK AO2 RAE44 SLP186 P0000 60006 T00440011 10044 20022 50002Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: WPR16FA054 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  FOX 13  LiveATC   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; 1,9 km SW of Cedar Fort, UT; 18 January 2016; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; 1,9 km SW of Cedar Fort, UT; 18 January 2016; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; 1,9 km SW of Cedar Fort, UT; 18 January 2016; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; 1,9 km SW of Cedar Fort, UT; 18 January 2016; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; 1,9 km SW of Cedar Fort, UT; 18 January 2016; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; 1,9 km SW of Cedar Fort, UT; 18 January 2016; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; 1,9 km SW of Cedar Fort, UT; 18 January 2016; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; 1,9 km SW of Cedar Fort, UT; 18 January 2016; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were no injuries to the 153 passengers and crew members onboard the MD-88 or to the one person aboard the B767 nor to the four ground crew personnel.  There was substantial damage to the horizontal stabilizer and elevator of the MD-88. According to the operator, after landing the MD-88 crew taxied into the alley in the vicinity of gate 36, awaiting gate 41B to clear, and set the parking brake.   Airport Customer Service (ACS) representatives were towing the B767 to gate 42 (the ACS personnel were not aboard with the intent for flight), and following a Port Authority vehicle to gate 42.  The ACS agents and the MD-88 flight crew reported that the ramp conditions were very slushy and limited space was available.  The ACS representative aboard the B767 requested that the MD-88 pull forward, to allow clearance between the two aircraft, and the flight crew complied with the request.  The captain stated that he could only move about 15 to 20 feet due to the ramp conditions. Shortly afterward, the flight crew felt the impact and noted that the two aircraft had made contact.  The tug driver was not aware of the impact until after arrival at gate 42.  The MD-88 was towed to the gate and passengers deplaned via the jetway.  The MD-88 received substantial damage to the left elevator, elevator tab, and horizontal stabilizer tip. The left winglet of the B767 received minor damage. Probable Cause: the ground crew's misjudgment of the distance between the B767 wingtip and the MD-88 tail.

Of the 148 passengers and crew members onboard, one flight attendant was seriously injured and the airplane was not damaged. The airplane was operating under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121as a regularly scheduled passenger flight from T. F. Green Airport (PVD), Providence, Rhode Island. According to the operator, the flights routing passed east of Jacksonville, Florida over the Atlantic to the east of the Florida peninsula.  A frontal system and jet stream stretched to the west and northwest of the flight's routing with turbulence forecast and reported on the western portions of the peninsula.  The flight crew reported that they were in cruise at FL380 in smooth air but were aware of potential turbulence throughout the flight.  Upon initial descent, the captain illuminated the fasten seat belt sign and advised the passengers to remain seated.  While descending through approximately FL320, the airplane encountered turbulence in clear air lasting approximately 3 seconds. At the time of the turbulence encounter, two flight attendants (FA) were securing the aft galley for landing when one fell to the floor injuring her ankle.  Medically trained passengers assisted the injured FA who could not complete her duties.  The flight crew advised the FLL station of the event and requested medical assistance upon landing.  The airplane landed at FLL with no further incident.  The flight attendant was transported to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a broken ankle.

The tour was originally planned to include a landing at Whitehaven Beach, however wind conditions at the time required the water landing be altered to Chance Bay. The aircraft approach Whitsunday Island from the north and conduct an orbit about 2 km north of Whitehaven Beach at about 15:10, before heading toward Whitehaven Beach. It flew over the southern end of Whitehaven Beach and the strip of land that separates it from Chance Bay. The pilot advised that he flew over the western end of Chance BayÂs main beach in order to conduct a visual pre-landing check of the bay. The pilot noted the positions of various vessels moored in the bay to determine the best taxi path to the beach. During this fly-over, the pilot also noted the sea state and observed evidence of wind gusts on the water surface. The pilot then initiated a right downwind turn toward the landing area. The approach was from the south with the intent to land in the most suitable location within the designated landing area and then taxi to the beach. The pilot reported setting up for landing at about 50 ft above the water and then delayed the landing in order to fly through an observed wind gust. Passenger video footage indicated that, during the subsequent landing, WTY bounced three times on the surface of the water. After the second bounce, with WTY getting closer to the beach and terrain, the pilot increased engine power and initiated a go-around. The third bounce, which occurred almost immediately after the second, was the most pronounced and resulted in the aircraft rebounding about 30 to 50 ft above the water. While increasing power, the pilot perceived that the torque was indicating red, suggesting an over-torque for the selected propeller configuration. Noticing that the climb performance was less than expected with the flaps at 30Â°, the pilot stopped increasing power and reduced the flap to 20Â°. As the aircraft climbed straight ahead towards a saddle, climb performance was still below the pilotÂs expectations and he assessed that WTY would not clear the terrain. In response, the pilot turned right to avoid the surrounding rising terrain. The aircraft clipped trees during this turn, before colliding with terrain and coming to rest in dense scrub about 150 m from the eastern end of the main beach, near the top of the ridge. The pilot promptly advised the passengers to exit and move away from the aircraft. Some of the 11 people on board suffered minor injuries but all were able to quickly leave the aircraft. There was no post-impact fire. Contributing factors - The aircraft's initial touches with water were past the nominated decision point and beyond the northern boundary of the ALA, which reduced the safety margins available for a successful water landing or go-around. - The pilot initiated a go-around without using all available power and the optimal speed, turned towards higher terrain and placed the aircraft in a down-wind situation, which ultimately resulted in the collision with terrain. Other findings - The aircraft was equipped with lap-sash seatbelts, which have been demonstrated to reduce injury, and the use of emergency beacons and satellite phone facilitated a timely response to the accident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ATSB Report number: AO-2016-007 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 years and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Daily Mercury  7News Brisbane  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The explosion occurred on the right hand side of the aircraft, just behind the R2 door, at seat 16F. A large hole was blown in the fuselage and one passenger fell out of the aircraft and was killed. Three other passengers were injured.  The aircraft returned to Mogadishu where it landed safely at 08:53 UTC (11:53 hours local time). An investigation revealed that the 55-year old passenger that was killed, was booked on Turkish Airlines flight TK689, which routes to Djibouti and Istanbul, Turkey.  On February 1 and 2 Turkish Airlines cancelled the return leg between Djibouti to Mogadishu and passengers had to take D3 159, which departed 65 minutes after the scheduled departure time of TK689. Somali intelligence officials say two airport workers handled the laptop believed to have contained the bomb. They handed over the laptop to the passenger that was killed. In May 2016 a military court in Somalia sentence ten people involved in the bombing.

LESSONS AND CONCLUSIONS The captain had checked the operation of the brakes during the procedure before start up but had not engaged the parking brake. Pressed by the falling rain, thinking that the parking brake was engaged, the first officer signalled the ramp agent to remove the chocks. In fact, after asking the captain if the brakes were ""OK"", the first officer assumed they were referring to the ""parking brake"" but he did not explain that clearly. The outward vision of the commander was changed by rainwater running down the windshield, which did not allow him to detect the plane's rolling. Despite intervention by the first officer on the movement of the aircraft, the captain did not have time to slow down. Since then, the aerodrome operator has modified the procedures for ramp agents on this parking area. They are now required to place the wedges on the front until the departure of the aircraft. Furthermore, a NOTAM was published and attracted the attention of crews on the peculiarity of this parking area. An amendment to the aerodrome VAC (AIP) chart must be issued.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Report number: BEA2016-0077 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft was pushed back from stand 15 at 14:34 JST. Subsequently engines no.2 and 1 were started and the aircraft began taxing. However heavy snowfall forced the plane back to a gate. While moving towards stand 20, about 15:06,  smoke entered the cabin and a tailpipe fire occurred on engine no.2. The aircraft was evacuated. One passenger was seriously injured (broken thoracic vertebrae) and two passengers were slightly injured during the evacuation. It appears that extreme snowfall caused ice on the fan blades and in the LPC (Low Pressure Chamber) of both engines, obstructing the air flow. Oil from the bearing sump was discharged, entering the cabin recirculation system and engine no. 2 tail pipe. This caused a mist in the aircraft cabin and ignition of oil in the hot tail pipe, causing flames.

All 23 on board suffered fatal injuries. The aircraft departed at 07:50 hours local time from Pokhara Airport (PKR) on a domestic 20-minute flight to Jomsom Airport (JMO), Nepal. The copilot acted as Pilot Flying, the captain as Pilot Monitoring during the flight. En route the flight deviated to the left and climbed to 12000 feet to avoid clouds.  Over the Ghorepani area the GPWS began to sound. The aircraft was flying through clouds with a little visibility in between and a descent to 10000 feet was initiated. At 10200 feet the GPWS sounded again but the captain responded not to worry about it. The captain was used to hearing these warnings in normal flight, so it became a habit to disregard the warnings. About one minute before the accident the captain took over control and initiated a climb. The aircraft impacted a mountainside at 10700 feet, coming to rest at an elevation of 10982 feet. According to a statement by the airline, the aircraft crashed near Tirkhe Dungha, Dana VDC of Myagdi district. Probable Cause: The Commission concludes that the probable cause of this accident was the fact that despite of unfavourable weather conditions, the crew's repeated decision to enter into cloud during VFR flight and their deviation from the normal track due to loss of situational awareness aggravated by spatial disorientation leading to CFIT accident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Nepal AAIC Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Hemant Arjyal  The Himalayan Times  Tara Air   Location  Images: photo (c) Google / annotations by ASN; Dana, Myagdi district; 24 February 2016 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft landed safely on runway 27 and was about to vacate the runway via taxiway N9 when the right main landing gear collapsed. There were no injuries to any person onboard the aircraft. The aircraft sustained substantial damage. The landing was carried out by co-pilot and captain was carrying out Supervised Line Flying (SLF). During landing flare, aircraft floated a little and the touchdown was normal. The aircraft landed with a  vertical acceleration of 1.44 G. About 16 seconds after touch down, at a speed of around 58 kts, there was right roll of 4.57Â° and the aircraft started veering to the right with a noise which felt like a tire burst to the cockpit crew. To maintain directional control first officer moved the tiller. The aircraft vacated via taxiway N9 and stopped on the taxiway with the tail of the aircraft not fully clear of runway 27. Taxiway N9 is about 2600 meters/8550 feet down the runway 27. Flaps were moved to 40, in case if the situation warranted an evacuation. Thereafter, the captain contacted the Jet Airways dispatcher. Also, the APU was started and engine no.2 was shut down, followed by engine no.1.  Meanwhile the airport fire service attended as the ATC controller had observed sparks from the right side of the aircraft after landing. On arrival of passenger stairs, the occupants were safely disembarked through the L1 door and no emergency evacuation was carried out. An investigation revealed that a main landing gear aft trunnion pin had failed as a result of improper grinding during overhaul. Several trunnion pins were overhauled by the same company. The first failure occurred on April 13, 2015 to a Jet Airways Boeing 737-800. During landing rollout at Khajuraho Airport, the left hand main gear aft trunnion pin failed.  According to maintenance records two sets of trunnion pins had been overhauled. As a precautionary measure, on 20 August 2015, the aft trunnion pins of VT-JGC were removed from the aircraft. After the accident involving VT-JGD, it appeared from maintenance records that in fact three sets of trunnion pins (including VT-JGD) had been overhauled by the same company. PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT: The Committee of inquiry determined the cause of accident as ""The RH Aft landing Gear trunnion pin failed due to base metal heat damage as a result of abusive grinding of the chrome plate that likely occurred during the last overhaul"".METAR: 16:00 UTC / 21:30 local time: VABB 031600Z 23007KT 3000 FU FEW100 32/15 Q1013 NOSIG16:30 UTC / 22:00 local time: VABB 031630Z 02003KT 3000 FU FEW100 32/15 Q1013 NOSIG17:00 UTC / 22:30 local time: VABB 031700Z 30006KT 3000 FU NSC 31/15 Q1014 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB India Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Boeing 737-800 VT-JGA 13 April 2015 accident, same cause   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Neither of the 2 flight crew were injured. The flight originated from the Louisville International Airport (SDF), Kentucky. The airplane sustained damage to a 23 foot long section of lower fuselage skin, 4 fuselage stringers, 5 fuselage frames, 3 floor stringers and the tail skid. The replacement of the frames and stringers was considered a major repair. According to the operator, the captain was the pilot flying, and the first officer the pilot monitoring for the flight from SDF-ABQ. Ground operations were normal in SDF and no aircraft loading or Weight and Balance discrepancies were noted. The climb, cruise, and descent portion of the flight were uneventful. Weather conditions at ABQ prior to arrival were reported as visual conditions, with wind from 090 at 20 knots gusting to 29 knots. The target approach speed used was 146 knots. The crew was vectored to the ILS approach to runway 03 and joined the localizer and glideslope using the autopilot. The autopilot was then disengaged at 1103 feet Height Above Touchdown (HAT) and at 1000 feet HAT the approach met all UPS Stabilized Approach criteria with the aircraft fully configured at flaps 30, gear down, and speed 145 knots. At 500 feet HAT the approach continued to meet all stabilized approach criteria with speed 146 knots. Flight data indicated that the crosswind component at this point was 23 knots from the right. At 158 feet above touchdown the approach met all stabilized approach criteria and the captain disconnected the autothrottles. UPS guidance recommends use of the autothrottle until 50 feet above touchdown. From this point on the approach until touchdown, the aircraft pitch attitude began to increase as the airspeed slowly decreased. Flight Data indicates that the thrust levers were at a reduced thrust setting when the autothrottles were disconnected and remained at that setting until touchdown. At 1.75 seconds from touchdown the airspeed had decayed to 129 knots and the aircraft pitch had increased to 7.2 degrees. The crosswind had also decreased and was now 13 knots from the right. At touchdown the airspeed was 128 knots and pitch attitude 8.4 degrees. The tailskid impacted the runway at touchdown followed immediately by the lower aft fuselage as the pitch attitude increased momentarily to 8.6 degrees. Initial tailskid impact occurred at approximately 800 feet from the runway threshold. The crew reported that they encountered a 10 knot wind loss just prior to touchdown and landed firmer than normal, but didn't suspect that they had struck the tailskid. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The pilot flying's failure to maintain airspeed and correct pitch attitude. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's failure to maintain appropriate thrust after disconnecting the autothrottles. Also contributing was the first officer's failure to monitor the decaying airspeed and increasing pitch.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA16CA113 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  7 February 2019 N305UP UPS 0 175 nm NE of Goose Bacy, Canada non Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Albuquerque Sunport Airport, NM (ABQ/KABQ); March 2016; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Three Ukrainian crew members died in the crash and another was critically injured.  The aircraft operated a scheduled cargo flight from Cox's Bazar to Jessore in Bangladesh. The on board cargo consisted of 802 boxes of shrimp weighing 4800 kg. The flight crew requested startup clearance at 02:58 UTC. The aircraft was then cleared to taxi to runway 35 via taxiway S.  Takeoff clearance was given 03:05 UTC.  During takeoff a drop in oil pressure in the torque meter system of engine no.1 caused the engine to lose power the cruise mode. The captain decided to continue takeoff. Immediately after becoming airborne the pilot reported an engine failure and requested for immediate return back to Cox's Bazar Airport. He was advised by ATC to report left hand down wind.  Within 60 seconds after takeoff the no. 1 lost power completely. The captain initially tried to maneuver the aircraft to land on runway 17 (departure runway, opposite direction), but was unable to line up with the runway. The crew decided to continue on a right hand downwind at around 1000 feet with a IAS of 300km/h in clean configuration. The aircraft turned to final and fully configured for landing and stable at around 3.5 NM from the runway. But at 1.2 NM for reasons unknown the captain decided to go around and climbed to 400-500 feet.  ATC advised the captain to report left hand down wind. But there was no response from the crew. The aircraft had impacted the shallow waters on the coast, 3 km West of the airport. Causes: a) Failure to initiate a rejected take off during take off roll following the indication of engine failure; b) Failure to adhere to the company SOP following the detection of the engine failure during take off; c) Considering the poor visibility at Cox's Bazar Airport, diverting to the alternate airfield Chittagong Airport located only 50 nm away that has the provision for full ILS approach facility. This could have helped the crew in carrying out a proper one engine out precision approach landing; d) The aircraft flew at a speed much lower than the clean configuration speed. The aircraft flew at 225 km/h in clean configuration whereas the minimum clean configuration speed is 290 km/hr. e) As per the FDR data the aircraft stalled while making a turn towards the side of the failed engine at a very low altitude;Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIG-BD Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) Hunter_UA; Kirovograd Airport (KGO/UKKG); 08 October 2015 photo (c) Hunter_UA; Kirovograd Airport (KGO/UKKG); 16 October 2014 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

According to flight crew statements, the captain was the flying pilot and the first officer (FO) was the pilot monitoring.Â  The airplane was level at flight level (FL) 270, with the autopilot off, in clear air with noÂ convective activity in the vicinity.Â  Immediately before before beginning the descent into IAH, the flight encountered a momentary pocket of moderate to severe turbulence with the airplane banking approximately 25 Ã¢ÂÂ 30 degrees to the right, and the altitude fluctuating from 100 feet up to 60 - 160 feet down. Â The flight crew did not recall seeing anything on the onboard weather radar or TCAS (traffic collision avoidance system).Â  The captain immediately turned on the seat belt signÂ and made an announcement on the public address for the passengers to fasten their seat belts. Shortly after, the flight crew were informed that a flight attendant FA was injured. The captain called the cabin and was informed thatÂ one of the FAs was severely injured.Â  The flight crew declared a medical emergency and arranged for paramedics to meet the flight at the gate.Â  The FA was transported to a local hospital and diagnosed with serious injuries. According to a weather analysis conducted by United Airlines, satellite imagery indicated no significant cloud features over the route of flight, with the moisture channel imagery indicating moisture channel darkening or drier air in the middle tropospheric levels across the northern half of Texas and southern Los Angeles with increasing moisture further to the south with the stronger jet stream winds.Â Â A review ofÂ pilot reportsÂ (PIREPs) across the region leading up to the turbulence only indicated light turbulence being encountered.Â Â Consequently, The Weather Company forecasts only called for light turbulence for the route.Â Â However, several Aircraft Meteorological Data and Reporting (AMDAR) automated reports across the region indicated that winds were stronger than predicted at higher levels and indicated a strong vertical wind shear at higher levels than originally forecast. Probable Cause: an inadvertent encounter with clear air turbulence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA16CA181 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA16CA181 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  17 February 2014 N23708 United Airlines 0 Kaycee, Wyoming non Turbulence Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates02-Jun-2023 13:51 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

Russell Regional Airport (RMG), Georgia. The pilot was uninjured and the co-pilot received minor injuries.  According to the crew, the automated surface observing system at the airport indicated the winds were variable at 6 knots. They requested and were cleared for the visual approach to runway 7, which was 4,495 feet-long. While in the traffic pattern and abeam the runway numbers, the crew lowered the landing gear and deployed 20 degrees of flaps, followed by 30 degrees on the base leg. On final approach, the crew stated that the turbulence was moderate and the airspeed started fluctuate and decreased to Vref. They responded by adjusting engine power on short final, and noted that ""considerable power"" was necessary to maintain airspeed. The airplane touched down at the Vref speed of 112 kts inside the touchdown zone, but the ground speed appeared to be fast. The crew activated the speed brakes, and the pilot applied the wheel brakes (the airplane was not equipped with thrust reversers). The crew then increased their braking to maximum, and when it was evident that the airplane not going to stop before the end of the runway, they activated the emergency brake. The airplane departed the end of the runway and travelled into the safety area, where it sank into the grass and mud as it continued forward in a slight left turn. The nose landing gear collapsed and the forward fuselage struck the ground resulting in substantial damage to the airframe. The airplane came to rest approximately 350 feet from the departure end of the runway. One of the flight crew members of the aircraft stated to ASN that NO tailwind was involved, contrary to what ASN previously reported based on a statement from an airport spokesman in local media. Instead, N465FL had three previous documented brake failures in the months preceding this accident.METAR: 17:53 UTC / 13:53 local time: METAR KRMG 141753Z AUTO 21012G17KT 10SM FEW044 SCT055 BKN095 22/14 A2977 RMK AO2 SLP074 T02220139 10233 20111 5802018:53 UTC / 14:53 local time: METAR KRMG 141853Z AUTO VRB04KT 10SM SCT043 SCT055 BKN100 24/13 A2975 RMK AO2 SLP067 T0239013319:53 UTC / 15:53 local time: METAR KRMG 141953Z AUTO 23013G21KT 190V260 10SM BKN050 BKN090 OVC110 23/13 A2974 RMK AO2 PK WND 21026/1904 SLP063 T02280128 Sources: NTSB   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft taxied out at 08:05 hours local time. The aircraft start up and taxiing was normal. The flight was given runway 25L for takeoff and the aircraft lined up on the runway. After obtaining takeoff clearance, the flight crew completed pre take off checks with no abnormalities observed. At 08:23:06, take off thrust was applied very gradually and the aircraft started to roll. Five seconds after reaching maximum power, at 08:23:35 the PM announced the speed being 80 kts. FDR data indicated an increasing trend in torque and drop in propeller rpm of engine no. 2, which was not monitored by the flight crew. The propeller rpm dropped to a minimum 709 rpm in the next 11 seconds. Also, torque of engine no.1 began to drop, without any significant change in rpm. The aircraft was still rolling for takeoff and accellerating through 95 kts. When the no. 2 engine propeller rpm started to drop, the PF announced that the aircraft began drifting towards the right. The PM replied ""continue...continue"". At 08:23:44 when the aircraft was reaching 96 kts, the PM asked PF to turn left and apply left rudder.  The flight crew did not realize at this stage that there was a problem with both engines and they were still below V1 which, as per pre flight calculation, was 104 kts.  At 08:23:49 the first officer asked the captain to increase the power of the left engine. By this time the drop in no. 1 engine torque had been arrested. It appears that the first officer had a glance on torque indicator and asked the captain to increase power.  At 08:23:53 the captain glanced at the engine instruments and wanted to express his concern about loss of power. Before being able the first officer announced ÂV1...rotateÂ at 08:23:55 and 101 kts of speed. After getting airborne, the aircraft continued to drift towards the right. In order to control the dropping speed and direction loss, the first officer took over the controls. At 08:24:08 when decreasing speed had reached 98 kts the first officer asked the captain to raise the landing gears in order to reduce drag and gain speed. The aircraft had climbed to approximately 39 feet above ground and the captain asked the first officer to lower the nose in order to gain speed. At 08:24:19 when the aircraft was at 101 kts and approximately 41 feet above ground level, the first officer asked the captain to raise the flaps. While the aircraft was losing altitude, the maximum speed of 105 kts was recorded and aircraft was passing through 10 feet above ground level. Also, at this time the first officer asked the captain to reduce left engine power. The first officer judged that there was no option other than to make the aircraft land on the remaining runway. The aircraft hit the runway surface with landing gear retracted, approximately 9000 ft from the beginning of runway 25L. The aircraft continued to drag on the runway while continuously drifting right for 800 ft before departing towards right side on the fair weather strip. After travelling approximately 600 ft on the fair weather strip, the aircraft veered towards the left and came to a final stop on the runway 1050 ft short from end of runway. As the captain was seriously injured, the first officer brought fuel control levers, propeller levers and power levers back; put the battery and generators off after the aircraft came to halt. An immediate evacuation of the passengers was carried out. Cause of Occurrence The investigation therefore, concludes that: 1. Some internal malfunction of the Propeller Governor Part No. 8210-410 Serial No. 2490719 was the cause of experienced uncommanded auto feather. However, exact cause of the occurrence could not be determined. 2. Continuing take off below V1 speed (104kts) after encountering engine malfunction and after takeoff raising flaps below recommended height (400ft AGL) lead to decrease in lift and unsustainability of flight.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: PakCAA Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane was destroyed and the 55 passengers and 7 crew fatally injured. Flight 981 departed Dubai at 18:37 hours UTC on March 18. The en route part of the flight was normal. The flight arrived near Rostov and the crew performed a manual approach to runway 22 with the autopilot disconnected. Weather conditions were poor with a cloud base at 630 meters, wind 230 degrees at 13 meters per second, maximum 18 meters per second, light rain shower, mist, severe turbulence and moderate windshear. At 22:42 UTC (01:42 local time) in the course of the initial approach at a height of 340 meters (1115 feet), the flight received a windshear alert. The flight crew decided to go around and then continued to a holding pattern waiting for improved weather conditions. The flight left the holding pattern at 00:28 UTC (03:28 LT) and descended towards Rostov for another approach to runway 22.  As the crew were proceeding with another manual approach, they decided to go around again at a height of 220 meters (721 feet), 4,5 km before the runway after receiving another windshear alert. They initiated a climb with a vertical speed of up to 20 m/s and setting the engines to maximum takeoff/go-around (TOGA) thrust. In the course of the go-around the crew set flaps to 15Â° and retracted the landing gear. At the height of 1900 ft (approx. 600 m) after reaching the pitch angle of 18Â° the pilot flying pushed on the control column, which led to a decrease in vertical acceleration of up to 0.5, increase in forward speed and, consequently, automatic retraction of flaps from 15Â° to 10Â° at a speed of over 200 knots. The short-term decrease in engine thrust within 3 seconds resulted in decreasing speed and flaps extension to 15Â°, although the following crew inputs to regain maximum takeoff/go-around thrust led to speed increase and reiterated automatic flaps retraction to 10Â°. The flaps remained in the latter configuration until the impact. The pilot flying, by pulling up the control column, continued climbing with a vertical speed of as much as 16 m/s. At a height of 900 m there was a simultaneous control column nose down input and stabilizer nose down deflection from -2,5 deg (6,5 units) to +2,5 deg (1,5 units). The FDR recorded a nose down stabilizer input from the stabilizer trim switch of the control wheel lasting 12 seconds, while the CVR record contains a specific noise of rotation of the trim wheels located on both sides of the central pedestal. As a result the aircraft, having climbed to about 1000 m, turned into descent with a negative vertical acceleration of -1g. The following crew recovery actions did not allow to avoid an impact with the ground. The aircraft hit the runway about 120 m from the threshold with a speed of over 600 km/h and over 50 degrees nose down pitch.

The fatal air accident to the Boeing 737-8KN A6-FDN aircraft occurred during the second go around, due to an incorrect aircraft configuration and crew piloting, the subsequent loss of PICÂs situational awareness in nighttime in IMC. This resulted in a loss of control of the aircraft and its impact with the ground. The accident is classified as Loss of Control In-Flight (LOC-I) occurrence. Most probably, the contributing factors to the accident were: - the presence of turbulence and gusty wind with the parameters, classified as a moderate to-strong ""windshear"" that resulted in the need to perform two go-arounds; - the lack of psychological readiness (not go-around minded) of the PIC to perform the second go-around as he had the dominant mindset on the landing performance exactly at the destination aerodrome, having formed out of the ""emotional distress"" after the first unsuccessful approach (despite the RWY had been in sight and the aircraft stabilized on the glide path, the PIC had been forced to initiate go-around due to the windshear warning activation), concern on the potential exceedance of the duty time to perform the return flight and the recommendation of the airline on the priority of landing at the destination aerodrome; - the loss of the PICÂs leadership in the crew after the initiation of go-around and his ""confusion"" that led to the impossibility of the on-time transition of the flight mental mode from ""approach with landing"" into ""go-around""; - the absence of the instructions of the maneuver type specification at the go-around callout in the aircraft manufacturer documentation and the airline OM; - the crewÂs uncoordinated actions during the second go-around: on the low weight aircraft the crew was performing the standard go-around procedure (with the retraction of landing gear and flaps), but with the maximum available thrust, consistent with the Windshear Escape Maneuver procedure that led to the generation of the substantial excessive nose-up moment and significant (up to 50 lb/23 kg) ""pushing"" forces on the control column to counteract it; - the failure of the PIC within a long time to create the pitch, required to perform go around and maintain the required climb profile while piloting aircraft unbalanced in forces; - the PICÂs insufficient knowledge and skills on the stabilizer manual trim operation, which led to the long-time (for 12 sec) continuous stabilizer nose-down trim with the subsequent substantial imbalance of the aircraft and its upset encounter with the generation of the negative G, which the crew had not been prepared to. The potential impact of the somatogravic ""pitch-up illusion"" on the PIC might have contributed to the long keeping the stabilizer trim switches pressed; - the psychological incapacitation of the PIC that resulted in his total spatial disorientation, did not allow him to respond to the correct prompts of the F/O; - the absence of the criteria of the psychological incapacitation in the airline OM, which prevented the F/O from the in-time recognition of the situation and undertaking more decisive actions; - the possible operational tiredness of the crew: by the time of the accident the crew had been proceeding the flight for 6 hours, of which 2 hours under intense workload that implied the need to make non-standard decisions; in this context the fatal accident occurred at the worst possible time in terms of the circadian rhythms, when the human performance is severely degraded and is at its lower level along with the increase of the risk of errors. The lack of the objective information on the HUD operation (there were no flight tests of the unit carried out into the entire range of the operational G, including the negative ones; the impossibility to reproduce the real HUD readings in the progress of the accident flight, that is the image the pilot was watching with the consideration of his posture in the seat trough the stream video or at the FFS) did not allow making conclusion on its possible impact on the flight outcome.

The aircraft, approached runway 25 for landing at the Rio Grande Airport in good visibility. Wind was 260 degrees at 19 knots. A normal landing was carried out in the first third of the runway. Deceleration started normally but at some point the aircraft maintained its speed.  The pilot proceeded to apply maximum reverse and maximum brakes and the airplane decelerated until a speed of approximately 20-30 kts. It traveled the last 600-800 meters of runway without increasing or reducing speed. Subsequently the pilot-in-command decided to steer the plane off the runway to avoid collision with the ILS system and stopped both engines. The aircraft collided with a mound of earth, causing structural damages. Conclusions of the analysis On a general aviation flight, during landing at the International Airport Governor Ramon Trejo, there was runway excursion 25 on the right side of the runway. The aircraft was stopped by impact against a mound, causing the recorded damage. The reasons for the runway excursion could not be established with certainty due to the lack of solid evidence. However, we were able to identify two factors of relevance to operational safety: - The divergence from the regulations referring to runway margins, which caused the damage to the aircraft. While this deficiency was not related to causality with the accident, influenced the severity of it. - The absence of a brake system failure procedure.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JIAAC Report number: 91845/16 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources: JIAAC   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Dark, night time conditions existed at the time of the accident. The ATR-42-600, operated by TransNusa Aviation Mandiri and registered PK-TNJ, was parked at stand B-1 on the north apron of Halim Airport and was to be moved from the north to the south apron. For this the aircraft had to cross the active runway. A towing car was used with a driver and one supporting personnel. Two engineers occupied the pilot seats in the aircraft. The engineers were assigned to apply aircraft brakes if required during the towing process. The towed aircraft was towed without aircraft electrical power fed to the system and the navigation light, strobe light and the aircraft radio communications were off. The communication between the towing car driver and Halim Tower was performed by a handheld radio communication on frequency 152.7 MHz. At 19:45 local time flight ID7703 requested pushback clearance to the Halim Tower controller on frequency 118.6 MHz. The aircraft was parked on parking stand B-2 and was approved to push back.  After the ID7703 completed the pushback, the towing car driver of the towed aircraft requested clearance to Halim Tower Control Unit to reposition from parking stand B-1 to the south apron. The towing car driver was instructed to follow ID7703 and to report when on taxiway C. The communication between the towing car driver and Halim Tower was handled by the assistant controller. The controller heard the communication between the assistant and towing car driver, he recognized the position of the towed aircraft was on the parking stand B-1.  The ID7703 flight crew did not know that there was a towing aircraft behind as communications with the car were on a different frequency. At 19:48, ID7703 received taxi clearance to runway 24 via taxiway C. At 19:50, the controller instructed ID7703 to hold on taxiway C due to an arriving aircraft. The assistant stated that when ID7703 was holding on short taxiway C, the towing car began moving the ATR-42. At 19:53, ID7703 received clearance from controller to enter runway 24 to back track for departure. The aircraft that had just arrived would use parking stand B-1. Therefore, the assistant controller instructed the towing car driver to expedite the tow and report when on taxiway C. The controller was not observing the ATR at that time. The towing car was about to enter taxiway C at that time. At 19:56, ID7703 reported ready for takeoff. The controller did not see any vehicle or object on the runway then issued clearance for takeoff. The pilot stated that during line up, the lights surrounding the turn pad were very bright and affected his forward vision for a short time. It was common practice in Halim to lineup at the turn pad beyond the threshold runway 24. After receiving the takeoff clearance, the Second in Command (SIC) as pilot flying (PF) opened the power and pressed the Take Off / Go Around (TOGA) button. The towing car driver stated that, when he saw ID7703 was lining up for takeoff, he asked Halim Tower whether ID7703 was initiating the takeoff. There was no reply from Halim Tower. The towing car driver then sped up the towing and turned to the right side of the runway. When ID7703 was accelerating through approximate 80 knots, the SIC saw an object warned the captain. The pilots could not identify the object but later on when the object became closer, the SIC realized that there was an aircraft. The captain took over control and applied the right rudder towards the right side of runway centerline and maintained a course between the runway centerline and the runway edge. The PIC intended to reject the takeoff shortly after they felt an impact. The impact occurred at a ground speed of about 130 knots, after passing V1. The pilot rejected takeoff and the aircraft stopped at approximately 400 meter from the towed aircraft which stopped at the left of the runway 24 centerline at approximately 100 meters from taxiway G. The captain noticed fire on the left wing tip and immediately shut down both engines, activated the fire extinguishers of both engines and Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) and commanded to the flight attendant ""evacuation from the right"". The flight attendants opened all aircraft passenger doors and the escape slides deployed. Most of passengers were evacuated from the left forward door (L1). Both aircraft sustained substantial damage. There were no reported injuries to the accident.  The outer portion of the left wing of the Boeing 737, about 5,75 m, was severed. The ATR-42s left hand wing, outboard of the no.1 engine, was severed, along with the entire empennage. Contributing Factors: - Handling of two movements in the same area with different controllers on separate frequencies without proper coordination resulted in the lack of awareness to the controllers, pilots and towing car driver. - The communication misunderstanding of the instruction to follow ID 7703 most likely contributed the towed aircraft enter the runway. - The lighting environments in the tower cab and turning pad area of runway 24 might have diminished the capability to the controllers and pilots to recognize the towed aircraft that was installed with insufficient lightings.METAR: 12:00 UTC / 19:00 local time: WIHH 041200Z 04006KT 5000 HZ FEW017CB SCT018 30/25 Q1010 RMK CB TO SWAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSC Report number: KNKT.16.04.07.04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources: Batik Air statement  NTSC   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSC; Jakarta-Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport (HLP); 04 April 2016 photo (c) Galih Mahastra; Jakarta-Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport (HLP); 2017 photo (c) NTSC; Jakarta-Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport (HLP); 04 April 2016 photo (c) NTSC; Jakarta-Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport (HLP); 04 April 2016 photo (c) NTSC; Jakarta-Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport (HLP); 04 April 2016 photo (c) Leslie Snelleman; Toulouse-Blagnac Airport (TLS/LFBO); 14 September 2014 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Approximately two minutes before 9H-AMZ landed, with the aircraft flying a stabilised final approach about 4 NM from the runway threshold, an Airbus A319 commenced its take-off run from the start of runway 05 and took off around 40 seconds later. The crew of 9H-AMZ flew over the displaced threshold of runway 05 with the correct approach profile and at the correct reference speed, and commenced the flare at a radio altitude of 10 ft. Moments later, the aircraft was caught by a positive wind shear of around 13 kt and rolled into a slight right bank, which the crew countered with an aileron deflection to the left. Immediately afterwards, the aircraft suddenly and severely rolled on its longitudinal axis to a left bank angle of 12.1Â°. The crew immediately countered this with a vigorous aileron deflection to the right. Nevertheless, 9H-AMZ struck the runway with its left wingtip and subsequently touched down with the main landing gear whilst at an almost horizontal bank attitude. The process of slowing down and taxiing from the runway was uneventful.  The occupants of 9H-AMZ were not injured. The aircraft was damaged on the left outer leading-edge slat. Causes The accident, in which a business aircraft touched the runway with one wingtip (wingtip strike), can be attributed to a high bank angle during the landing flare. The most probable cause for this high bank angle was found to be wake turbulence from a commercial aircraft that had previously taken off on the runway, which caused the business aircraft to roll around its longitudinal axis. The accident was caused by the combination of the following factors: - Light wind weather conditions, which delayed the decay of wingtip vortices; - A prolonged landing flare near the ground, which led to a touchdown at the end of the landing zone at low airspeed; - Insufficient distance between the displaced runway threshold and the point of rotation of an aircraft, which had previously taken off.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: STSB Report number: 2359 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 years and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The accident plane took off from Iruma at 08:49 for a check flight to Kanoya Air Base, and after planned check at Kanoya in the morning, it landed at Kanoya at 12:06.  After refueling, the plane took off at 13:15, and performed the remaining check of the JAT TACAN.  At 14:31, the plane began the 'alignment orbit check' following a low pass over runway 08R.  In this check, the plane lost radar contact while flying an anti-clock-wise 6nm arc with an altitude of 3000 feet after climbing from 2500 feet.  The wreckage was found by a search party of Japan Grand Self-Defense Force on 7th April on Ontake peak of Mt. Takakuma, which has an elevation of 1182m (3875 feet). At the time of the accident, the captain acted as Pilot Not Flying and F/O was Pilot Flying. A GPWS warning sounded 12 seconds before the crash, however, the warning was switched off 2 seconds before the crash without any avoidance maneuvers. The cause of the accident was continued flight until the crash on 6nm arc from Kanoya JAT TACAN with an altitude of 3000 feet.  The factors of the accident were: PIC's misidentification on the heights of mountains under the planned flight path, visual obscuration near and/or in the clouds after climbing from 2500 feet to 3000 feet, and no adequate response to the GPWS warning. A contribution factor of insufficient supervision to the flight plan is also identified.Sources: Yahoo Japan  mainichi.jp   Location  Images: photo (c) Esa Kaihlanen; Ibaraki Airport (RJAH); 30 October 2013 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The three occupants were injured.  The aircraft took off from runway 04 at Puerto GaitÃ¡n Airport about 06:22 hours local time. Upon rotation of the aircraft, the crew heard an explosion from the no.1 (left) engine. The pilot noticed that the no.1 engine cover had torn away, hitting the propeller blades. The aircraft began to lose height and speed and the crew decided to perform an emergency landing in a field.  The aircraft struck the ground causing detachment of the propellers and parts of the aircraft. After coming to rest, a post-impact fire started that consumed much of the aircraft.  An inspection of the engine revealed that one of the cylinder heads had broken away. Parts were found near the end of the runway. Probable cause: Wrong application by the crew of the emergency procedure due to engine No. 1 failure, since they reduced the RPM of the operative engine (No. 2), causing the BMEP limit to be exceeded, producing an engine stall (No. 2), making the flight of the plane impossible and forcing the execution of a forced landing.

The aircraft took off from Tekin Airport at 13:56 hours local time on a VFR flight to Kiunga. On board were the pilot-in-command and 11 passengers: eight adults and three infants. In addition to the passengers and their baggage, the aircraft was carrying a significant quantity of vegetables.  The weather at Kiunga was reported to be fine. As the aircraft entered the Kiunga circuit area, the pilot cancelled SARWATCH with Air Traffic Services (ATS). The pilot did not report an emergency to indicate a safety concern. Witnesses reported that during its final approach, the aircraft suddenly pitched up almost to the vertical, the right wing dropped, and the aircraft rolled inverted and rapidly ""fell to the ground"". It impacted the terrain about 1,200 metres west of the threshold of runway 07. The impact was vertical, with almost no forward motion. The aircraft was destroyed, and all occupants were fatally injured. The investigation found that the right-wing fuel tank was empty. There was no evidence of pre- or postimpact fuel leakage. The backing plate behind the fuel selectors was bent during the impact, and had jammed the left selector in its selected position. It appeared that the pilot may have been cross feeding fuel from the left-wing tank to feed the right engine. The aircraft had been reweighed 5 months prior to the accident. The operator had not sought to obtain CASA approval of the new weight and balance data sheet for inclusion in the Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM). There was no evidence that the pilot had computed load distribution within the aircraft. The investigation determined that while the aircraft was within the weight limitations, the load distribution placed it in a significantly aft centre of gravity (c of g) situation for takeoff and landing.  The investigation determined that the right engine had failed, probably subsequent to the SARWATCH broadcast, but sufficiently before the aircraft pitched nose up, in order for the pilot to have had time to wind in full nose-left rudder trim to counteract the aerodynamic forces imposed by the failure of the right engine. Contributing factor: The aircraftÂs centre of gravity was significantly aft of the aft limit. When landing flap was set, full nose-down elevator and elevator trim was likely to have had no effect in lowering the nose of the aircraft. Unless the flaps had been retracted immediately, the nose-up pitch may also have resulted in tailplane stall, exacerbating the pitch up. The wings stalled, followed immediately by the right wing dropping. Recovery from the stall at such a low height was not considered possible. Other factors Other factors is used for safety deficiencies or concerns that are identified during the course of the investigation, that while not causal to the accident, nevertheless should be addressed with the aim of accident and serious incident prevention, and the safety of the travelling public. a) Following the reweighing of SBC, the operator did not make adjustments to account for the shift of the moment arm as a result of the reweighing. Specifically, a reduction of allowable maximum weight in the baggage compartment. b) The pilot, although signing the flight manifest on previous flights attesting that the aircraft was loaded within c of g limits, had not computed the c of g. No documentation was available to confirm that the pilot had computed the c of g for the accident flight, or any recent flights. c) All of the High Frequency radio transmissions between Air Traffic Services and SBC were significantly affected by static interference and a lot of hash, making reception difficult, and many transmissions unclear and unreadable. This is a safety concern to be addressed to ensure that vital operational radio transmissions are not missed for the safety of aircraft operations, and the travelling public.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIC PNG Report number: AIC 16-1002 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  23 April 2014 P2-SBC Sunbird Aviation PNG 0 Kikori Airport (KRI) sub Runway excursion Location  Images: photo (c) Flite Sefti; Kiunga Airport (UNG/AYKI); 23 April 2016 photo (c) Flite Sefti; Kiunga Airport (UNG/AYKI); 23 April 2016 photo (c) PNG AIC; near Kiunga Airport (UNG/AYKI); 13 April 2016 photo (c) PNG AIC; near Kiunga Airport (UNG/AYKI); 13 April 2016 photo (c) PNG AIC; near Kiunga Airport (UNG/AYKI); April 2016 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft, a Beechcraft 1900D, was scheduled to depart Goose Bay Airport at 19:20 and arrive at the Gander at 20:54. The flight was operated by Exploits Valley Air Services. Before departing, the captain checked the weather at Gander and the alternate airport, Deer Lake Airport (CYDF). The visibility at Gander was 1/8 statute miles (sm) in heavy snow. The weather forecast for the time of arrival was wind 360Â° magnetic (M) at 35 knots, gusting to 55 knots; visibility 1/4 sm in heavy snow and blowing snow; vertical visibility 100 feet above ground level (agl). Starting at 22:30, the visibility was forecast to increase to 1/2 sm in moderate snow and blowing snow, and the vertical visibility was to improve to an overcast ceiling at 400 feet agl. A significant meteorological information (SIGMET) message was issued indicating severe turbulence below 3000 feet agl over an area of Newfoundland that included Gander. The crew planned to conduct the instrument landing system with distance measuring equipment precision approach for runway 03 (ILS/DME RWY 03) at Gander.  The captain called the company's acting operations manager to discuss the potential operational impact if the flight had to divert to its alternate. At first, the intent was to delay the flight for an hour to wait for the snowfall intensity to diminish and for the visibility to improve. However, after speaking with the acting operations manager, the captain decided to depart as scheduled, anticipating that the weather conditions would improve by the time they reached Gander. The crew was unaware that other carriers had cancelled their flights to Gander.  The aircraft departed at 19:45 on an instrument flight rules flight plan. There were 14 passengers and 2 crew members on board. The first officer (F/O) was the pilot flying. While en route, the F/O indicated that he did not feel comfortable conducting the approach and landing due to his limited experience and the potential challenges associated with the anticipated weather conditions. The captain agreed to conduct the approach and landing. During the flight, the crew received updated weather reports from both the Gander Area Control Centre and Gander Tower, which indicated an increase in visibility from 1/8 sm to 1/2 sm and a reduction in the snowfall intensity from heavy to light. The crew decided that the visibility was sufficient to conduct the approach as initially planned. The winds and blowing snow were not identified as concerns. While the flight was en route, snow removal was in progress at Gander. The airport plows were focused on clearing the middle 120 feet of the 200-foot-wide runway. The plows had pushed the snow into windrows along both sides of the runway, about 60 feet from the centreline. The crew contacted the tower controller for the runway surface condition report. The latest runway condition report for runway 03, taken at 2044, was as follows: 120 feet cleared width, 40% dry snow with a depth of 0.13 inches and 60% bare and dry; remaining width 100% dry snow with a depth of 4 inches; remarks - windrows along reported width with a depth of 10 inches. The snowplows continued plowing the runway until about 21:10, at which point they began to plow a path for the aircraft to follow from the runway to the apron. On the approach, about 12 minutes before touchdown, the aircraft began to encounter moderate turbulence through 5700 feet above sea level. This turbulence continued until landing and was significant enough that the passengers were experiencing discomfort. Once the aircraft intercepted the localizer, control of the aircraft was transferred to the captain as planned. The landing gear was lowered and the flaps were set to full, as per the company's standard operating procedures. At 21:24, the tower controller cleared flight 7804 to land and provided the crew with the current tower winds of 360Â°M at 36 knots, gusting to 44 knots. The crew acquired the runway approach lighting at about 800 feet agl, more than 2 nautical miles (nm) from the threshold. At approximately 21:30, while on short final, the crew asked for a wind update. The tower controller informed the crew that the tower winds were currently unavailable and provided the last aerodrome special meteorological report (SPECI), which had been taken 18 minutes before. The SPECI indicated that the winds were 350Â°M at 29 knots, gusting to 41 knots. In the landing flare, the captain asked the F/O to call out the heights on the radar altimeter to help them determine how high they were above the ground. Almost immediately, the 10- and 0-foot calls were made. There was no indication that the crew lost visual contact with the runway edge lighting. At about 21:30, the aircraft touched down on its main landing gear (MLG) to the right of the centreline at a normal descent rate and in a relatively flat attitude about 2800 feet from the threshold. The crew was unaware how far to the right of the centreline they were when they touched down. Almost immediately, the aircraft veered to the right when the right-side MLG encountered snow. The nose landing gear (NLG) struck the windrow of compacted snow, which caused the NLG to collapse. As the aircraft's nose began to drop, the propeller blades struck the snow and runway surface. All of the left-side propeller blades and 3 of the right-side propeller blades separated at the blade root. A portion of a blade tip from the right-side propeller penetrated the cabin wall at floor level. The aircraft slid down the runway, with the nose coming within 27 feet of the runway edge, before crossing back through the windrow toward the centreline. The aircraft came to a stop about 14 seconds after touchdown on a heading of about 350Â°M. The nose was about 15 feet to the right of the centreline and 3400 feet from the threshold. Once the aircraft came to a stop, the F/O opened the cabin door and evacuated the passengers. The captain shut down the engines. The tower controller did not have any ground radar and was unaware that the aircraft was stopped on the runway. The captain contacted the tower controller to report the situation and request assistance. The tower controller immediately activated the crash bell. The first fire truck left the station within 1 minute of the crash bell being activated. About 2 minutes later, the plow drivers, who were cross-trained as fire rescue personnel, drove the remaining 2 fire trucks and the rescue vehicle to the aircraft. Because the location of the aircraft was not known, the vehicles started at the north end of runway 03. They proceeded cautiously because of the reduced visibility from blowing snow and because the passengers were out on the runway. The first fire truck arrived at the aircraft about 6 minutes after the accident. In total, 3 fire trucks, 1 rescue vehicle, and 2 pickup trucks responded. Once the firefighters established that there was no fire, the rescue vehicle and pickup trucks started transporting passengers to the terminal. Within 25 minutes of the crash bell being activated, all passengers and crew had been transported to the terminal. Three passengers sustained minor injuries. None of the injuries were attributed to the portion of the propeller blade that had penetrated the cabin. Findings as to causes and contributing factors: 1. Neither pilot had considered that the combination of landing at night, in reduced visibility, with a crosswind and blowing snow, on a runway with no centreline lighting, was a hazard that may create additional risks. 2. The blowing snow made it difficult to identify the runway centreline markings, thereby reducing visual cues available to the captain. This situation was exacerbated by the absence of centreline lighting and a possible visual illusion caused by blowing snow. 3. Due to the gusty crosswind conditions, the aircraft drifted to the right during the landing flare, which was not recognized by the crew. 4. It is likely that the captain had difficulty determining aircraft position during the landing flare. 5. The flight crew's decision to continue with the landing was consistent with plan continuation bias. 6. During landing, the nosewheel struck the compacted snow windrow on the runway, causing the nose landing gear to collapse.METAR: 00:00 UTC / 21:30 local time: METAR CYQX 210000Z CCB 33036G52KT 1/2SM R03/2800V5000FT/N R13/3000V5500FT/N -SN BLSN OVC007 M03/M04 A2930 RMK BLSN6SF2 /S33/SLP931=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A16A0041 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: CADORS  Air Canada   Location  Images: photo (c) Transportation Safety Board of Canada; Gander Airport, NF (YQX/CYQX); 20 April 2016; (CC:by-nc-nd) photo (c) Transportation Safety Board of Canada; Gander Airport, NF (YQX/CYQX); 20 April 2016; (CC:by-nc-nd) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane sustained substantial damage and there were no reported injuries among the 6 crew and 87 passengers onboard. The aircraft departed Quito at 06:51 hours local time.  During the landing preparation briefing, at 07:34, the pilot indicated that they would hold the glide slope until they had a runway in sight, inhibit the glide slope alarm, and continue visual. Four minutes later the flight was cleared for the VOR ILS ZULU approach for runway 23. The runway was wet due to drizzle and the braking efficiency reported by an Airbus A319 was good to average. The A319 had landed on the runway in Cuenca 36 minutes before flight 173.  At 07:46, the flight radioed that they were ten miles out and established on the localizer. They were cleared to the ILS approach for runway 23. Three minutes later the controller reported that they had flight 173 in sight and informed that the wind was calm, and cleared the flight to land on runway 23. T At 07:50, the pilot indicated that he had three red and one white lights on the PAPI system.  The aircraft crossed the runway threshold at 37 feet high instead of 50 feet, which meant the aircraft approached below the normal glidepath. It touched down 277 m past the threshold at an airspeed of 127 knots. Spoilers were deployed 585 meters from the threshold, followed by reverses at 643 m. The pilot, not feeling an effective braking of the aircraft, tried to activate the autobrake system but this did not work. The aircraft was hydroplaning and could not be brought to a halt on the runway. The pilot groundlooped the aircraft on the grass. Runway 23 is a 1900 m long runway with an upslope of 15 m (+0.78%). Distance from the centre of the end of the paved runway to the boundary fence and an active road is 31 m.	The Operational Landing Distance calculations with manual braking for the weight of the aircraft with wind on touchdown, indicate that a runway length of 2,122 meters was necessary. PROBABLE CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS (translated from Spanish language report) The Accident Investigation Board determines that the probable causes of this accident were: 1. The condition of the runway at Cuenca airport, which at the time of the plane's landing was contaminated with water and slippery. 2. The landing was made after a non-stabilized approach with a tailwind. 3. The non-application of the Maximum Performance Landing procedure recommended by the aircraft manufacturer for landing on contaminated runways. The following factors contributed to this event: 1. The dispatch of the flight with 1,500 kg of fuel more than the amount of fuel usually used for this flight. 2. Omission of the runway length calculation necessary to perform the landing using the braking efficiency information. 3. The crew's decision to make the final approach with three red and one white lights, using the PAPI system, induced by the information in the Terminal Information document issued by the company, which authorised this procedure. 4. The use of confusing terminology in the Terminal Information document, which used terms applicable to the Airbus fleet, instead of Embraer's. 5. The crew's decision not to perform the thwarted approach maneuver after the maximum allowable vertical speed was exceeded and visibility was apparently limited after the minima were exceeded. 6. Incorrect use of aircraft braking aids, in this case reverse braking aids 7. The application of the emergency brake that inhibits the antiskid system. 8. Lack of implementation of adequate management of crew resources, particularly within the cockpit. 9. Lack of training in the use of tables for track distance calculation.METAR: 12:00 UTC / 07:00 local time: SECU 281200Z 35003KT 9999 -RA FEW010 OVC030 13/12 Q102713:00 UTC / 08:00 local time: SECU 281300Z 33003KT 8000 -RA FEW010 OVC030 13/12 Q1028Wind: 330 degrees at 3 knots; visibility 8000 m in light rain; few clouds at 1000 feet, overcast at 3000 feet; Temperature 13Â°C; Dew point 12Â°C; QNH 1028 mbAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: JIA Ecuador Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Cuenca Airport statement  aerospotter.blogspot.com   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft, a Fokker 50, operated by Amapola Flyg on behalf of Air VallÃ©e, departed Rimini at 08:49 on a domestic service to Catania. The aircraft was approaching runway 08 at Catania Airport when the nose landing gear failed to deploy. The approach was abandoned about 10:37 hours. The airplane climbed to 2900 feet and entered a holding pattern to the east of the airport while the crew tried to troubleshoot the problem.  Finally a forced landing was carried out on runway 08 at 11:34 with the nose gear doors open but the nose gear retracted. CAUSES   The accident was caused by the failure of the nose landing gear (nose gear up) due to over-extension of the shock absorber which caused interference between the tires and the NLG compartment and locked the NLG in a retracted position.  The over-extension was caused by the incorrect installation of some internal components of the shock absorber during the replacement of the internal seals the day before the accident.   The following factors contributed significantly to the improper activity conducted at maintenance:  - the insufficient experience of technical personnel in carrying out the maintenance tasks conducted on the NLG;  - the lack of controls on the operations carried out, deemed unnecessary by the CAMO engineering department;  - the lack of definition of roles and tasks during the planning phase of the maintenance work;  - the operational pressure on maintenance personnel, arising from the need to conclude maintenance operations quickly in order not to penalize the management of the aircraft;  - the insufficient clarity and lack of sensitive information in the maintenance tasks and related figures contained in the AMM, regarding the replacement of internal shock absorber seals, subsequently made clearer by the manufacturer;  - the reported black and white printing of the applied AMM procedures, which could have made the warnings in the manual barely legible.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ANSV Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 years and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: ANSV  Repubblica.it  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane was operated by the pilot as a familiarization flight. The commercial pilot and sole passenger were not injured. The airplane departed the Upland-Cable Airport, California, about 11:45.  The pilot stated to the NTSB that the flight was a familiarization flight for a new member of their chapter of the Commemorative Air Force. The flight departed the Cable airport and flew east along the mountains, headed to San Bernardino. They contacted the San Bernardino tower and were instructed to enter the crosswind for runway 24. As part of the before landing checklist, the pilot turned on the carburetor heat and switched the fuel tank selector to the right fuel tank. Shortly thereafter, the engine lost all power. The pilot attempted numerous times to restart the engine, but was unsuccessful.  The pilot realized that he would not be able to reach the airport, and decided to make a forced landing to a small field in a residential area. During the landing approach, the airplane contacted a power line. After touching down in the field the airplane nosed over and came to rest inverted, which resulted in substantial damage to the wings and fuselage. During the postaccident examination of the airplane, about 16 ounces of water were removed from the fuel system.  Water was present in the lower gascolator, the fine fuel filter (upper gascolator), and subsequent fuel line to the carburetor inlet.  A brass screen at the carburetor inlet and 2 carburetor fuel bowl thumb screens also contained corrosion, water, and rust.   The approved aircraft inspection checklist called for washing the carburetor and main fuel filter every 50 hours and cleaning and/or replacing the fine fuel filter every 100 hours.  The fine fuel filter is not easily accessible and not able to be drained during a preflight inspection. The mechanic who completed the most recent inspection stated that he did not drain or check the fine fuel filter. The last logbook entry that specifically stated the fuel filters were cleaned was about 4 years before the accident. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The mechanicÂs failure to inspect the fine fuel filter gascolator as required during the most recent inspection, which resulted in a total loss of engine power due to fuel contamination.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: WPR16LA101 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 12 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft departed Delhi Airport as flight 9W2793 at 17:40 local time (12:10 UTC). While en route ATIS was obtained by the crew approximately at 115 NM from Indore and the arrival briefing was completed at 100 NM from Indore. The crew asked ATC for permission to descend at 19:10, much before their descent point, so as to keep clear of weather and avoid turbulence. The winds reported by ATC were 130Â° and 08 knots. As the winds were favourable for runway 07 the crew decided for a VOR approach to runway 07 via DME arc. At 19:23 crew reported commencing the arc. While on final approach the crew asked for winds, ATC informed crew that the winds were 320Â° and 12 knots. The crew also saw tail winds on their Primary Flight Display (PFD) and decided to discontinue the approach. ATC then cleared the aircraft for an ILS approach to runway 25 from overhead. The crew then requested an ILS approach to runway 25 via the DME arc, as there was weather overhead. This was accepted by ATC at 19:31. At the same time ATC also informed crew that winds were then 100Â° and 12 knots. The aircraft climbed 4000 feet and was kept left of the runway, keeping runway in visual contact. The crew continued with the approach and went out for 15 NM to avoid weather before turning right to intercept the ILS. The flight reported established on localizer at 19:37 and was informed by ATC of moderate rain on airfield. At 19:38 crew reported intercepting ILS and was cleared to land with reported winds of 13 knots at 160Â°. As per the statement of crew the approach was clear and runway lights could be seen from 13 NM. The runway lights and PAPI lights appeared bright and hence the crew requested ATC to reduce the intensity of the lights. As the aircraft descended through 600 feet, auto pilot was disconnected. After the aircraft touched down, it veered to the right. The PIC tried to control the aircraft using rudder to turn it to the left. However aircraft went excessively to the left. The PIC was also warned by the co-pilot about the aircraft heading. The aircraft continued going left even after application of full right rudder by the PIC. The aircraft subsequently went out of the runway into the unpaved surface on left, damaging runway edge lights, runway marking light and a taxiway edge light. The aircraft travelled approximately 180 meters on the unpaved surface while jumping a pit and crossing taxiway F near the isolation bay before coming to halt 78 meters away from runway centre line, with heading 204Â°. Probable cause of the Accident: Improper cross wind landing technique and failure to use nose wheel steering or differential braking after rudder efficiency was diminished due to decreasing speed caused the aircraft to veer out of runway. The runway condition was a contributory factor.METAR: 13:00 UTC / 18:30 local time: VAID 071300Z 10009KT 5000 -TS FEW020 SCT025 FEWCB030 33/16 Q1009 NOSIG15:00 UTC / 20:30 local time: VAID 071500Z 18014KT 5000 -TS FEW020 SCT025 FEWCB030 27/19 Q1010 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB India Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources: Images: photo (c) AAIB India; Indore Airport (IDR); 07 May 2016 photo (c) AAIB India; Indore Airport (IDR); 07 May 2016 photo (c) AAIB India; Indore Airport (IDR); 07 May 2016 photo (c) Flightradar24; Indore Airport (IDR); 07 May 2016 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane sustained substantial damage. The pilot, flight instructor, and two passengers were uninjured. The airplane was operated as an instructional flight that was not operating on a flight plan. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight that last departed from Jonesboro Municipal Airport, Arkansas at 16:50 and was destined to DXE. The pilot stated that the purpose of the flight was a Beechcraft B100 initial training flight with a second pilot who occupied the right pilot seat. According to the Federal Aviation Administration inspector, the flight instructor was in a non-seated position between both pilots. The left seat pilot stated that they flew about 3 hours and had taken turns performing turns, stalls, slow flight and approaches. He stated that the accident landing was the third landing of the day that he performed. He said that during the left downwind approach for landing on runway 18, he performed the airplane checklist items that the flight instructor read to him. The left seat pilot said that the landing gear extended, and the three landing gear position indicator lights illuminated green. The left seat pilot said that during touchdown, the right side of the airplane descended lower than the left side and then the right main landing gear collapsed. The airplane veered off and into a grass area adjacent to the runway. The aircraft came to rest approximately 2,518 feet from runway 18 touchdown end and 100 feet west of the runway edge in a field of grass. The right hand main gear was collapsed, right hand prop blades were bent and the right wing leading edge and tip was damaged. Evidence of fuel leakage was noted surrounding the right wing in the grass. The wing top skin outboard of the engine nacelle displayed evidence of wrinkling. Post-accident examination revealed the bottom right wing skin to the integral fuel tank was torn resulting in an approximate five by three inch hole. The right main gear actuator assembly exhibited numerous bent parts and was broken out of its mounting structure. The inboard top actuator mounting structure was torn away from the airframe. The right nacelle fuel tank bulkhead was ruptured with the top of the gear actuator resting inside the tank area. The top wing skin wrinkling was not as evident post recovery but still shows signs of damage. Puncture damage to the fuselage pressure vessel was noted in 5 places below the copilot side window and a two-inch crack or tear was found on the belly skin approximately centered between the main gear legs. The rigging for the landing gear system could not be checked nor could functional gear swing test be performed due to damage incurred to the system from the accident. The accident aircraft, N86TR, was involved in a gear-up landing incident On November 17, 2005 at Fulton County Airport, Atlanta.

The pilot suffered a minor injury, but none of the 17 skydivers on board were injured. The pilot reported that following takeoff from runway 26, he made a right turn and continued his climb for the skydive drop, however, while passing through 1,000 feet above ground level, the engine lost power. The pilot initiated a turn toward the airport, however, realized he was unable to make it, and landed in an open field. During the landing roll, the airplane exited the field, crossed E Jahant Road, impacted a truck, continued into a vineyard, and nosed over. Postaccident examination of the engine revealed that the fuel pressure line that connects the fuel control unit to the airframe fuel pressure transducer was fractured below the fuel control unit fitting's swaged seat. In addition, a supporting clamp for the fuel pressure fuel line was fractured and separated. The operator reported that the fractured fuel line had been replaced the night before the accident and had accumulated about 4 hours of operational time. The previously-installed line had also fractured. Probable Cause and Findings: ""A total loss of engine power due to a fatigue fracture of the fuel pressure line that connected the fuel control unit and the fuel flow transducer due to vibration as the result of a fatigue fracture of an associated support clamp.

Seven of the nine occupants suffered fatal injuries. The crew planned to fly from Baku (Azerbaijan) to Bagram (Afghanistan), Dwyer (Afghanistan), Mary (Turkmenistan) and then back to Baku. The flight legs to Dwyer Airport were uneventful.  At 13:11 the crew started the engines on the apron at Dwyer Airport. Engine no.2 was the last to be started up at 13:47 hours. Before the takeoff the captain distributed the duties within the crew, nominating the first officer as the Pilot Flying, and himself as Pilot Monitoring. After the engine startup the crew initiated taxiing to perform takeoff on runway 23. The concrete runway at Dwyer measured 2439 m by 37 m.  In the course of the takeoff preparations, at 13:57:56 the flight mechanic reported an increase in MGT of engine no.3 above the acceptable level: ""Engine 3, look, engine temperature over six hundred, over seven hundred"", which was confirmed by the first officer: ""Yes, itÂs getting temperature"" while the captain asked to be more attentive. The takeoff was performed with Flaps 15. As the checklist was being read, the captain ordered to lock the propellers. After the captain's order to lock the propellers a slight increase in torque values was recorded on engine no.1 and 4, and in 17 seconds also engine no.2. There was no evidence that the propeller of engine no.3 was locked. At 13:59:42 the crew initiated the takeoff. Before the takeoff the ATC advised the crew on the wind direction and speed on the runway: 280Â° 14 knots (7 m/sec) gusting 26 knots (13 m/sec). Thus it was quartering headwind and the headwind component might have been 5 to 9 m/sec. While performing takeoff the crew first increased thrust on engines no.1 and no.4 and then on engine no.2 after 10 seconds. The thrust of the three engines was about 50 kg/sq.cm as per torque indicator (lower than takeoff mode). The third engine was still operating in the ground idle mode, though the CVR did not record any crew callouts concerning engine no.3 operation parameters. Based on the CCTV system of Dwyer Airport the takeoff roll was initiated almost from the runway threshold and was conducted to the left of the runway centerline. No significant deviations from the takeoff course during the takeoff roll were recorded. During the takeoff roll the rudder was deflected left close to extreme. Probably the pilots were also applying differential control on engine no.2 to decrease the right torque moment. At 14:00:14 at approximately 120 km/h IAS the ""Engine no.3 negative thrust"" signal started. At that time the aircraft was about 430 m away from the start of the takeoff roll. At 14:00:42 engines no.1 and no.4 thrust was increased up to 63 kg/sq.cm as per torque indicator (consistent with takeoff mode for the actual flight conditions). At that time the IAS was about 150 km/h. Engine no.2 thrust was increased up to the same value only 23 seconds later at about 200 km/h IAS. At that time the aircraft was about 840 m away from the runway end. Engine no.3 was still operating in ground idle mode. Approximately 260 m before the runway end at a speed of 220 km/h IAS (maximum speed reached) nose up input on the control column was started. The aircraft did not lift off. After rolling all along the runway the aircraft overran the runway onto the ground at a speed of 220 km/h. While moving on the ground the aircraft sustained significant damage, which led to a post-crash fire that destroyed most of the aircraft structures. Out of the nine persons on board seven were killed and two were seriously injured and taken to hospital. The accident with the An-12B 4K-AZ25 aircraft was caused by the decision of the crew to take off with a failed engine No. 3, the propeller of which was not feathered. During the entire takeoff run, engine No. 3 remained at ground idle, as a result of which the engine propeller created a negative thrust that increased as the speed increased, preventing the crew from reaching the take-off speed of the aircraft from the runway.

Flight MS804 departed Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport, France, at 21:21 UTC (23:21 hours local time on May 18). Scheduled departure time was 22:45 LT. Destination of the flight was Cairo, Egypt. At 23:22 UTC the flight entered Greek airspace at FL370. Last radio contact was at 23:48 UTC during a radio frequency change. At 00:25:24 UTC a hissing sound was heard in the cockpit, followed by a 'pop' and a second hissing sound. The captain, copilot and a flight attendant sitting in the jump seat all exclaimed ""fire!"". The copilot then called for a fire extinguisher. From 00:25:58 UTC on the Flight Data Recorder began logging multiple warnings, like 'Lavatory smoke', 'Avionic smoke', and Master Warnings. This continued with additional warnings and errors until the end of the recording. At 00:27:23, ATC instructed the flight to contact Cairo ACC, but no reply was received. The aircraft suddenly taking a 90 degree turn left, followed by a 360 degree turn to the right as it descended from FL370 to FL150 before disappearing off radars. The aircraft impacted the surface of the sea. The Flight Data Recorder and Cockpit Voice Recorder were both recovered from the sea bed on June 16, 2016.  The Egyptian AAID published its final report on October 30, 2024, concluding: Probable cause The aircraft flight path was uncontrollable as the aircraft and the flight crew were severely affected by fire and smoke. This resulted from the effects of the explosive materials located at the forward galley just behind the rear section of the cockpit. The aircraft crashed into the sea. Contributing factors - The fire/smoke event took place very quickly and flight crew were disabled. - Several aircraft systems failure. - Explosion resulted in oxygen flow in the cockpit, which enriched the fire/ smoke. BEA France commented on the EAAID's findings and remarked: The factual accuracy of the report is questionable, and the reasoning for the scenarios appears to distort the facts. The report repeatedly mentions the presence of French experts concerning the discovery of TNT. The BEA would like to emphasize that the French experts acted as advisors and observers and had neither the role nor the possibility of validating any findings concerning the presence of explosives on human remains. The French experts involved indicated that the results obtained do not allow for a definitive conclusion regarding the presence of TNT. However, the presence of TNT is never questioned and is taken as an assumption or even as a starting point in all scenario analyses. This leads to an unrealistic scenario incompatible with the sequence of warnings, failures and crew announcements. The BEA disagrees with the scenario established by the investigation committee and maintains the conclusions drawn from its study: The accident sequence began while the aeroplane was cruising at FL370, with a cabin crew member present in the cockpit, the captain resting in his seat and the co-pilot flying. It has not been possible to precisely explain the start of the accident sequence. It is likely to have been an oxygen flow resulting either from a component failure (in the oxygen storage box or in the upstream distribution system) or from pressing the EMERGENCY knob on the co-pilot's oxygen mask. A fire then started in the mask storage box, and was fed by a leak of pressurised oxygen. It has not been possible to determine which came first: the fire or the oxygen leak. Whichever the case, the oxygen-fed fire spread to the outside of the storage box. This type of fire is rapid, large-scale and uncontrollable. It produces a characteristic noise comparable to that of a blowtorch. The protective and extinguishing equipment items in the cockpit were not sufficient to bring the fire under control. The fire damaged the computer power supply systems, which led to the disconnection of the autopilot in particular. No crew actions were recorded in the cockpit. It has not been possible to determine whether the crew remained in the cockpit, whether they were unconscious or whether they fled the fire and then returned or remained outside the cockpit. The aeroplaneâs flight path was uncontrolled and the aircraft collided with the sea.

The airplane stopped on the runway at the intersection C5, about 1500m down of 3360m long runway , with spread debris and trace of the brakes in the last 700m. The flight crew used two extinguishing bottles on engine no.1 to put out the fire. At 12:43, five minutes after the aircraft came to a stop, the flight crew ordered an evacuation since they received a new fire indication for engine no.1. All 319 onboard were evacuated on the runway using emergency slides from right side doors.  No serious injuries were found among 302 passengers and 17 crew members, however, 19 had medical treatments for smoke inhalation and/or bruises during evacuation, 12 sent to hospital. The accident runway were closed for five and a half hours, and three remaining runways were also closed for two hours. This incident caused more than 400 of other commercial flights to be cancelled, as well as many more diversions, delays and returns to the destination. Probable Causes It is highly probable that the causes of this accident were the fracture of the high pressure turbine (HPT) disk of the No.1 (left-side) engine during the takeoff ground roll, the penetration of the fragment through the engine case and the occurrence of subsequent fires. Regarding the cause for the 1st stage HPT disk to be fractured, it is probable that a step was machined exceeding the allowable limit when machining U-shaped groove on the aft side of the 1st stage HPT disk to manufacture the engine and from this step the low-cycle fatigue crack was initiated and propagated during running of engine. Regarding why the step could not be found, it is somewhat likely that defects failed to be detected at the time of the inspection by the manufacturer during the production process. And as for the cracks that were not found, it is somewhat likely that those cracks failed to be detected at non-destructive inspection on the disk by the Company at the time of maintenance of the engine in use. Regarding the fire breakout from the No.1 engine, it is probable that due to the impact forces generated by the release of the fragment from the ruptured rim part of the 1st stage HPT disk through the engine case and the engine rundown loads generated when the engine stopped suddenly, the cracks were developed in the outer case of the Fuel Oil Heat Exchanger and the fuel and engine oil leaking through these cracks contacted the hot area of engine cases of the No.1 engine to be ignited.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JTSB Report number: AA2018-5 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Images: photo (c) JTSB; Tokyo-Haneda Airport (HND); 27 May 2016 photo (c) JTSB; Tokyo-Haneda Airport (HND); 27 May 2016 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were no injuries among the five passengers and three crew members. The aircraft operated on a flight from Krasnodar to Neryungri with an en route stop at Tyumen. The night time approach was conducted with a visibility of 10+ km. Wind was from 350Â° at 2 m/s. There were broken clouds at 190 m and overcast with cumulonimbus clouds at 510 m. Temperature and dew point were both +4Â°C. QFE pressure was 685 mm Hg (913 hPa). During the descent the air traffic controller informed the crew that QFE (field elevation) pressure was 685 mm Hg and QNH (sea level) pressure was 1012 hPa. The flight crew radioed: ""I confirm 685, [...] is 1012 hectopascals, do we understand it correctly?"" To which the controller replied ""...QNH 1012, for information the height of the threshold is 08, 857 meters."" This was misunderstood by the flight crew. They did not convert the pressure at the runway level of 685 mm Hg to hectopascals (685 mm Hg corresponds to 913 hPa), but instead set the pressure at 1012 hPa on the altimeters and continued the descent. At 23:13:33 hours the EGPWS sounded: ""Sink rate"", followed a second later by ""Caution terrain!"" At 23:13:36 hours the EGWS again sounded: ""PULL UP"". At 23:13:53 hours, at a distance of 18 km from the threshold of runway 08, the aircraft impacted trees. The flight crew managed to regain height and performed a safe landing at Neryungri Airport. A post-flight inspection revealed damage to the wing leading edges and winglets, dents on the no.2 engine cowling, dents to the flaps and right hand horizontal stabilizer. Contributing factors (Translated from Russian): - Insufficient preparation of the crew for the flight, expressed in the fact that the crew did not have the Neryungri airfield (Chulman) ATIS frequency and had a lack of knowledge of the AIP requirements about the additional request to the ATC controller to obtain aerodrome pressure in hectopascals. There were no reference data on the Neryungri airfield (Chulman) in the airlineÂs Operations Manual; - Inattention of the crew in interpreting the QNH and QFE pressures transmitted by the controller to the aircraft; - The Standard Operating Procedures for the Air Traffic Controllers of the Neryungri Air Traffic Service Centre did not contain specific instructions for the adjustment of the Complex of the Automatic Air Traffic Control System ""Alpha""  - The Standard Operating Procedures of the Neryungri (Chulman) airport control tower did not contain control procedures for the assigned flight altitude on the descent and approach of the aircraft.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: MAK  Ministry of Transport RF   Location  Images: photo (c) MAK; Neryungri Airport (NER); June 2016 photo (c) MAK; Neryungri Airport (NER); June 2016 photo (c) MAK; Neryungri Airport (NER); June 2016 photo (c) MAK; Neryungri Airport (NER); June 2016 photo (c) MAK; Neryungri Airport (NER); June 2016 photo (c) MAK; Neryungri Airport (NER); June 2016 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft, an McDonnell Douglas MD-11F cargo plane was bound for Anchorage, Alaska.  The aircraft's takeoff weight was 629,600 lbs, which was below the maximum allowable take-off weight of 630,500 lbs. The flight was cleared for takeoff from runway 33L. The aircraft reached V1 speed after a ground run of 6413 feet. About that time the crew heard a noise, originating from the failure of the no.9 tire (the left-hand tire on the central landing gear). The no.10 tire on the same landing gear also ruptured. Vibration and torsion forces then caused the lower drag brace of the central landing gear to break. The drag brace then hit the body several times. This caused a rupture of the hydraulic system of brake system 1, reducing the total brake efficiency to about 48% as the crew rejected the takeoff. With 4,635 feet of runway remaining the aircraft began to decelerate. The aircraft required a deceleration distance of at least about 5,550ft from the position where the takeoff was rejected. As a result, the MD-11 stopped at approximately 1,591 ft (485 m) past the end of the runway 33L. The nose gear collapsed and the no. 1 and 3 engines contacted the grass. The ARAIB investigators noted that there is an inherent difficulty in determining the flight performance of an aircraft after V1 when limited information and little time is available to the crew for a go/no-go decision. The UPS flight operations manual states that after V1, rejecting takeoff is not recommended unless the captain judges that aircraft can not fly, but the manual does not establish a definition of 'non-flying'. ARAIB notes that it would be beneficial for the aviation industry to provide flight crews with definitions of 'non-flightability' and additional guidance and training as to how to judge aircraft flight performance under certain circumstances, especially after V1. CAUSE (translated from Korean): After the take-off determination speed (V1), the high-speed takeoff abandonment is performed by the tire of the central landing gear and the drag brace defect, and the runway is separated. Contributing factor is "" (1) For limited time and available information on the encountered situation, (2) Dynamic instability of dragging of central landing gear after tire failure. (3) Decrease in braking performance due to rupture of hydraulic pipe of brake system 1 "".METAR: 13:30 UTC / 22:30 local time: RKSI 061330Z 36001KT 9000 SCT040 BKN120 19/14 Q1012 NOSIG14:00 UTC / 23:00 local time: RKSI 061400Z 36002KT 9000 SCT040 BKN120 20/14 Q1012 NOSIG14:30 UTC / 23:30 local time: RKSI 061430Z 28003KT 250V320 9000 SCT040 BKN120 20/14 Q1012 NOSIG15:00 UTC / 00:00 local time: RKSI 061500Z 12002KT 8000 SCT040 BKN120 20/14 Q1012 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: ARAIB Report number: ARAIB/AAR1606 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years Download report:  Final report Sources: Yonhap  Korea Times   Location  Images: photo (c) ARAIB; Seoul-Incheon International Airport (ICN); June 2016 photo (c) ARAIB; Seoul-Incheon International Airport (ICN); June 2016 photo (c) ARAIB; Seoul-Incheon International Airport (ICN); June 2016 photo (c) ARAIB; Seoul-Incheon International Airport (ICN); June 2016 photo (c) ARAIB; Seoul-Incheon International Airport (ICN); 06 June 2016 photo (c) ARAIB; Seoul-Incheon International Airport (ICN); 06 June 2016 photo (c) Konstantin Von Wedelstaedt; Dubai Airport (DXB/OMDB); 24 October 2008 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Of the eight people on board, the pilot and four passengers sustained serious injuries, and three passengers sustained minor injuries. Visual meteorological conditions (VMC) prevailed at the Anaktuvuk Pass Airport at the time of the accident. The flight departed from the Fairbanks Airport, about 10:30, destined for Anaktuvuk Pass.  The pilot stated that he was flying along the John's River about 2,500 feet msl, 500 feet above ground level (agl) while en route to Anaktuvuk Pass Airport (AKP). About 10 miles from the airport, he began to climb to airport traffic pattern altitude and maintain a flight track on the east side of the river valley to conduct a straight-in approach to runway 2 at AKP. Although some ice was present on the windshield, the deice/anti-ice equipment was operating as designed, and the windshield hot plate remained free of contamination. He stated that due to the overcast skies and snow covered ground, a flat light condition was present. The aircraft impacted an area of snow-covered tundra, at an elevation of about 2,500 feet msl. The top of the ridge where the airplane impacted is at an approximate elevation of 3,000 feet msl. From the initial point of impact, the airplane traveled about 300 feet before coming to rest in an upright position. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and wings.  Immediately following the accident, a passenger utilized a cellular phone to call for rescue from Anaktuvuk Pass residents. About 20 minutes after the call, the airplane was located and rescue personnel began extricating passengers and transporting them via snow machine to Anaktuvuk Pass for medical attention.

Both pilots were killed. The aircraft departed Oslo-Gardermoen Airport, Norway at 23:10 hours local time on a mail and package flight to TromsÃ¸, Norway.  The take-off, departure and climb to cruising altitude, flight level 330, were performed according to normal procedures. The flight was uneventful until one minute and 20 seconds before the impact. The event started at 00:19:20 hrs, one hour and ten minutes into the flight in night time conditions of darkness without moonlight, clouds or turbulence. The lack of external visual references meant that the pilots were totally dependent on their instruments which consisted of three independent attitude indicators. Suddenly a very fast increase in pitch was displayed on the left attitude indicator. The pilot in command, who was the pilot flying and seated in the left seat exclaimed a strong expression. The displayed pitch change meant that the pilot in command was subjected to a surprise effect and a degradation of spatial orientation. The autopilot was, most probably, disconnected automatically, a ""cavalry charge"" aural warning and a single chime was heard, the latter most likely as a result of miscompare between the left and right pilots' flying displays (PFD). Both elevators moved towards nose down and nose down stabilizer trim was gradually activated from the left control wheel trim switch. The airplane started to descend, the angle of attack and G-loads became negative up to -1 G. Both pilots exclaimed strong expressions and the co-pilot said ""come up"". About 13 seconds after the start of the event the crew were presented with two contradictory attitude indicators with red chevrons pointing in opposite directions. At the same time none of the instruments displayed any comparator caution due to the PFDs declutter function in unusual attitude. Bank angle warnings were heard and the maximum operating speed and Mach number were exceeded 17 seconds after the start of the event, which activated the overspeed warning. The speed continued to increase, a distress call was transmitted and acknowledged by the air traffic control and the engine thrust was reduced to flight idle. The crew was active during the entire event. The dialogue between the pilots consisted mainly of different perceptions regarding turn directions. They also expressed the need to climb. At this stage, the pilots were probably subjected to spatial disorientation. The aircraft collided with the ground one minute and twenty seconds after the initial height loss. Investigation revealed that the erroneous attitude indication on PFD 1 was caused by a malfunction of the Inertial Reference Unit (IRU 1). The pitch and roll comparator indications of the PFDs were removed when the attitude indicators displayed unusual attitudes. In the simulator, in which the crew had trained, the corresponding indications were not removed. During the event the pilots initially became communicatively isolated from each other. Factors as to cause and contributing factors: The accident was caused by insufficient operational prerequisites for the management of a failure in a redundant system. Contributing factors were: - The absence of an effective system for communication in abnormal and emergency situations. - The flight instrument system provided insufficient guidance about malfunctions that occurred. - The initial manoeuver that resulted in negative G-loads probably affected the pilots' ability to manage the situation in a rational manner. Factors as to risk The fact that fault descriptions regarding aircraft and its components are reported in a less detailed manner might imply that the faults will not be identified and corrected in an efficient way. This can in turn lead to a flight safety issue as, for instance, intermittent faults cannot always be detected by general tests.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: SHK Report number: SRL 2016:01e Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) Source: Swedish Accident Investigation Authority photo (c) Source: Swedish Accident Investigation Authority; January 2016 photo (c) Source: Swedish Accident Investigation Authority; January 2016 photo (c) Giuseppe Battioli; Oslo-Gardermoen Airport (OSL/ENGM) [LN]; 23 August 2015 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Both occupants died in the accident. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed in the area, and an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan was filed for the personal cross-country flight from Salt Lake City International Airport, Utah, about 09:50, with an intended destination of Tucson International Airport, Arizona. The pilot contacted the SLC departure controller at 0951:59 and reported that he was climbing through 7,500 ft mean sea level (msl) for 10,000 ft. The controller then cleared the pilot to climb to and maintain Flight Level 230 (FL230), and to delete speed restrictions; the pilot confirmed the clearance. At 0952:21, the controller instructed the pilot to maintain 14,000 ft, to delete all speed restrictions, and asked him what speed he was climbing at; the pilot confirmed the clearance and stated that he was climbing at 200 knots (kts). At 0955:01, while approaching 14,000 ft the pilot reported that he had a failure with his Flight Management System (FMS), that he was ""switching to NAV for a second,"" and would be exceeding the assigned altitude. This was followed by an unintelligible transmission. At 0955:16, the controller instructed the pilot to descend and maintain 14,000 ft and to fly his present heading. About 10 seconds later, the pilot advised the controller that he had an autopilot failure, and requested a climb to visual meteorological conditions. The controller instructed the pilot to climb and maintain FL180. At 0955:47, the pilot responded by confirming the climb to FL180. The controller then asked the pilot if he needed assistance. The pilot did not immediately respond, and the controller asked him a second time. At 0956:16, the pilot responded ""negative,"" saying that he was ""just trying to get to clear skies,"" and was climbing to FL180. The pilot stated that his ""number 2"" was working, and that his ""altitude"" had failed. The pilot concluded the transmission by saying, ""...so, uh, my number two is working, climbing to one eight thousand."" At 0956:32, the controller advised the pilot that traffic would be crossing above him at FL190, and that it was important that he level the airplane at FL180; the pilot replied, ""We'll be watching."" At 0956:45, the controller advised the pilot of two areas of light precipitation directly ahead of the airplane, and asked the pilot if he would need vectors to clear the weather. At 0956:59, the pilot responded that he would appreciate any vectors possible. Shortly thereafter, at 0957:06, the controller asked the pilot to ""...paint a picture for me of where you think the clearest skies would be. I can vector you wherever you need to go."" At 0957:12, the pilot replied that he was heading to TUS, his altitude would not hold, and that he was hand flying the airplane. About this time, radar showed the airplane beginning a right turn from its previously-established southerly heading to a southwesterly heading, though the airplane had neither been cleared to do so by the controller nor had the pilot informed the controller of the deviation. About 0957:20, the pilot transmitted that he would appreciate any vectors possible. About 15 seconds later, the controller advised the pilot that he was showing him at 17,500 ft, directed the pilot to fly his present heading, and stated that the airplane would be clear of the precipitation in about 4 miles. About 17 seconds later, the pilot transmitted, ""...ok, MAYDAY. I do need to get up higher. I am losing different instruments. I'd really like to get clear of weather."" At 0958:01, the controller issued the pilot a clearance to climb and maintain FL230, which the pilot confirmed. About 0958:26, the controller amended the previous clearance and instructed the pilot to climb to and maintain FL310, which the pilot initially confirmed, but shortly thereafter stated, ""...yeah. I can't even dial that in. Still climbing, passing twenty thousand, so I'm just going to be reading it out to be sure my second is operating correctly."" At 0958:46, the controller stated that he was showing the airplane climbing through 20,200 ft, and asked the pilot if he wanted to continue to TUS; the pilot replied, ""That is affirmative."" At 0958:53, when the airplane was at 20,700 ft, the controller issued the pilot a no-gyro turn to the left for vectors to the southeast; this occurred about 1 minute 41 seconds after the airplane had turned southwest. Radar data showed that the pilot initiated a right turn from a southwesterly heading at an altitude of 20,700 ft. At 0959:12, the airplane reached an altitude of 21,300 ft. msl, and was still in the right turn. At 0959:13, the controller stated, ""November one bravo x-ray. I show you in a right turn. Can you turn left?"" At 0959:17, while climbing out of 21,300 ft, the pilot replied that he was ""trying to climb."" About 0959:47, the controller advised the pilot that he had lost the airplane's altitude readout, and asked the pilot the airplane's altitude. There were no further transmissions received from the pilot. Between 0959:49 and 0959:58, the airplane descended from an altitude of 21,300 ft to 16,000 ft, with its rate of descent during this time increasing from 9,600 ft per minute (fpm) to 36,000 fpm. The airplane's wreckage was located in open, flat pasture ground, about 1 nautical mile southwest of Cedar Fort, Utah, and about 28 nm south-southwest of SLC. A survey of the accident site revealed that the linear debris path of wreckage extended for about 1 nm on a west to east orientation. Probable Cause: ""The pilot's loss of control due to spatial disorientation while operating in instrument meteorological conditions, which resulted in an exceedance of the airplane's design stress limitations, and a subsequent in-flight breakup. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's reported inflight instrumentation anomaly, the origin of which could not be determined during the investigation.""METAR: 09:53 UTC / 16:53 local time: KSLC 181653Z 13004KT 10SM -RA FEW030 BKN046 OVC060 03/01 A3009 RMK AO2 RAE01B51 SLP191 P0000 T0033000610:53 UTC / 17:53 local time: KSLC 181753Z 17005KT 10SM FEW030 BKN044 OVC065 04/01 A3008 RMK AO2 RAE44 SLP186 P0000 60006 T00440011 10044 20022 50002Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: WPR16FA054 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  FOX 13  LiveATC   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; 1,9 km SW of Cedar Fort, UT; 18 January 2016; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; 1,9 km SW of Cedar Fort, UT; 18 January 2016; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; 1,9 km SW of Cedar Fort, UT; 18 January 2016; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; 1,9 km SW of Cedar Fort, UT; 18 January 2016; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; 1,9 km SW of Cedar Fort, UT; 18 January 2016; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; 1,9 km SW of Cedar Fort, UT; 18 January 2016; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; 1,9 km SW of Cedar Fort, UT; 18 January 2016; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; 1,9 km SW of Cedar Fort, UT; 18 January 2016; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The ACS representative aboard the B767 requested that the MD-88 pull forward, to allow clearance between the two aircraft, and the flight crew complied with the request.  The captain stated that he could only move about 15 to 20 feet due to the ramp conditions. Shortly afterward, the flight crew felt the impact and noted that the two aircraft had made contact.  The tug driver was not aware of the impact until after arrival at gate 42.  The MD-88 was towed to the gate and passengers deplaned via the jetway.  The MD-88 received substantial damage to the left elevator, elevator tab, and horizontal stabilizer tip. The left winglet of the B767 received minor damage. Probable Cause: the ground crew's misjudgment of the distance between the B767 wingtip and the MD-88 tail.  Contributing to the accident was the slushy condition of the ramp which limited the maneuvering space available.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA16CA070 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  6 November 2012 N908DE Delta Air Lines 0 Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, GA (ATL/KATL) non Uncontained engine failure Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates08-Oct-2018 16:42 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

Of the 148 passengers and crew members onboard, one flight attendant was seriously injured and the airplane was not damaged. The airplane was operating under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121as a regularly scheduled passenger flight from T. F. Green Airport (PVD), Providence, Rhode Island. According to the operator, the flights routing passed east of Jacksonville, Florida over the Atlantic to the east of the Florida peninsula.  A frontal system and jet stream stretched to the west and northwest of the flight's routing with turbulence forecast and reported on the western portions of the peninsula.  The flight crew reported that they were in cruise at FL380 in smooth air but were aware of potential turbulence throughout the flight.  Upon initial descent, the captain illuminated the fasten seat belt sign and advised the passengers to remain seated.  While descending through approximately FL320, the airplane encountered turbulence in clear air lasting approximately 3 seconds. At the time of the turbulence encounter, two flight attendants (FA) were securing the aft galley for landing when one fell to the floor injuring her ankle.  Medically trained passengers assisted the injured FA who could not complete her duties.  The flight crew advised the FLL station of the event and requested medical assistance upon landing.  The airplane landed at FLL with no further incident.  The flight attendant was transported to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a broken ankle. Probable Cause: an inadvertent encounter with clear air turbulence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA16CA077 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: NTSB History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  27 December 2012 N718SW Southwest Airlines 0 Islip, Lonmg Island non Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates19-Aug-2017 13:17 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

The pilot was conducting his third flight of the day when the aircraft departed Hamilton Island Airport at about 14:15 local time with 10 passengers on board. The tour included a scenic flight over the Great Barrier Reef for about 50 minutes before heading to Chance Bay, on the south-east tip of Whitsunday Island, about 11 km north east of Hamilton Island Airport. Following a water landing at Chance Bay, the group was to spend 90 minutes at the beach before a short flight back to Hamilton Island. The tour was originally planned to include a landing at Whitehaven Beach, however wind conditions at the time required the water landing be altered to Chance Bay. The aircraft approach Whitsunday Island from the north and conduct an orbit about 2 km north of Whitehaven Beach at about 15:10, before heading toward Whitehaven Beach. It flew over the southern end of Whitehaven Beach and the strip of land that separates it from Chance Bay. The pilot advised that he flew over the western end of Chance BayÂs main beach in order to conduct a visual pre-landing check of the bay. The pilot noted the positions of various vessels moored in the bay to determine the best taxi path to the beach. During this fly-over, the pilot also noted the sea state and observed evidence of wind gusts on the water surface. The pilot then initiated a right downwind turn toward the landing area. The approach was from the south with the intent to land in the most suitable location within the designated landing area and then taxi to the beach. The pilot reported setting up for landing at about 50 ft above the water and then delayed the landing in order to fly through an observed wind gust. Passenger video footage indicated that, during the subsequent landing, WTY bounced three times on the surface of the water. After the second bounce, with WTY getting closer to the beach and terrain, the pilot increased engine power and initiated a go-around. The third bounce, which occurred almost immediately after the second, was the most pronounced and resulted in the aircraft rebounding about 30 to 50 ft above the water. While increasing power, the pilot perceived that the torque was indicating red, suggesting an over-torque for the selected propeller configuration. Noticing that the climb performance was less than expected with the flaps at 30Â°, the pilot stopped increasing power and reduced the flap to 20Â°. As the aircraft climbed straight ahead towards a saddle, climb performance was still below the pilotÂs expectations and he assessed that WTY would not clear the terrain. In response, the pilot turned right to avoid the surrounding rising terrain. The aircraft clipped trees during this turn, before colliding with terrain and coming to rest in dense scrub about 150 m from the eastern end of the main beach, near the top of the ridge. The pilot promptly advised the passengers to exit and move away from the aircraft. Some of the 11 people on board suffered minor injuries but all were able to quickly leave the aircraft. There was no post-impact fire. Contributing factors - The aircraft's initial touches with water were past the nominated decision point and beyond the northern boundary of the ALA, which reduced the safety margins available for a successful water landing or go-around. - The pilot initiated a go-around without using all available power and the optimal speed, turned towards higher terrain and placed the aircraft in a down-wind situation, which ultimately resulted in the collision with terrain. Other findings - The aircraft was equipped with lap-sash seatbelts, which have been demonstrated to reduce injury, and the use of emergency beacons and satellite phone facilitated a timely response to the accident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ATSB Report number: AO-2016-007 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 years and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Daily Mercury  7News Brisbane  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The plane began to roll back and the main gear ran into a gutter. The rear fuselage came to rest on the ground. It appeared the parking brake had not been set. LESSONS AND CONCLUSIONS The captain had checked the operation of the brakes during the procedure before start up but had not engaged the parking brake. Pressed by the falling rain, thinking that the parking brake was engaged, the first officer signalled the ramp agent to remove the chocks. In fact, after asking the captain if the brakes were ""OK"", the first officer assumed they were referring to the ""parking brake"" but he did not explain that clearly. The outward vision of the commander was changed by rainwater running down the windshield, which did not allow him to detect the plane's rolling. Despite intervention by the first officer on the movement of the aircraft, the captain did not have time to slow down. Since then, the aerodrome operator has modified the procedures for ramp agents on this parking area. They are now required to place the wedges on the front until the departure of the aircraft. Furthermore, a NOTAM was published and attracted the attention of crews on the peculiarity of this parking area. An amendment to the aerodrome VAC (AIP) chart must be issued.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Report number: BEA2016-0077 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Of the 100 passengers and crew onboard, one passenger received serious injuries.Â  The airplane was not damaged. The regularly scheduled passenger flight was operating under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 from Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (PHX), Phoenix, Arizona, to MSP. The flight crew stated that at FL350, prior to their planned top-of-descent, Minneapolis Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) informed them to expect light turbulence during the descent through about FL280. The captain made a public address announcement to the passengers and cabin crew to expect light turbulence so to fasten their seatbelts. The seatbelt sign was on at that time, and had been on most of the flight due to light turbulence.Â  As the flight was descending through about FL310, the nose of the airplane dipped down and the airspeed increased, and to avoid an overspeed the pilot flying pitched the nose up and deployed the speed brakes. Subsequently, they received a call from the flight attendants that a passenger had been injured after having stood up ""to stretch"" just before the turbulence.Â  After arriving at the gate, the passenger was transported to the hospital and diagnosed with a broken leg. Probable Cause: an encounter with turbulence that resulted in a serious injury to a passenger who was standing when the fasten seatbelt sign was illuminated.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA16CA089 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA16CA089  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates02-Jun-2023 13:56 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

While moving towards stand 20, about 15:06,  smoke entered the cabin and a tailpipe fire occurred on engine no.2. The aircraft was evacuated. One passenger was seriously injured (broken thoracic vertebrae) and two passengers were slightly injured during the evacuation. It appears that extreme snowfall caused ice on the fan blades and in the LPC (Low Pressure Chamber) of both engines, obstructing the air flow. Oil from the bearing sump was discharged, entering the cabin recirculation system and engine no. 2 tail pipe. This caused a mist in the aircraft cabin and ignition of oil in the hot tail pipe, causing flames.

All 23 on board suffered fatal injuries. The aircraft departed at 07:50 hours local time from Pokhara Airport (PKR) on a domestic 20-minute flight to Jomsom Airport (JMO), Nepal. The copilot acted as Pilot Flying, the captain as Pilot Monitoring during the flight. En route the flight deviated to the left and climbed to 12000 feet to avoid clouds.  Over the Ghorepani area the GPWS began to sound. The aircraft was flying through clouds with a little visibility in between and a descent to 10000 feet was initiated. At 10200 feet the GPWS sounded again but the captain responded not to worry about it. The captain was used to hearing these warnings in normal flight, so it became a habit to disregard the warnings. About one minute before the accident the captain took over control and initiated a climb. The aircraft impacted a mountainside at 10700 feet, coming to rest at an elevation of 10982 feet. According to a statement by the airline, the aircraft crashed near Tirkhe Dungha, Dana VDC of Myagdi district. Probable Cause: The Commission concludes that the probable cause of this accident was the fact that despite of unfavourable weather conditions, the crew's repeated decision to enter into cloud during VFR flight and their deviation from the normal track due to loss of situational awareness aggravated by spatial disorientation leading to CFIT accident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Nepal AAIC Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Hemant Arjyal  The Himalayan Times  Tara Air   Location  Images: photo (c) Google / annotations by ASN; Dana, Myagdi district; 24 February 2016 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft landed safely on runway 27 and was about to vacate the runway via taxiway N9 when the right main landing gear collapsed. There were no injuries to any person onboard the aircraft. The aircraft sustained substantial damage. The landing was carried out by co-pilot and captain was carrying out Supervised Line Flying (SLF). During landing flare, aircraft floated a little and the touchdown was normal. The aircraft landed with a  vertical acceleration of 1.44 G. About 16 seconds after touch down, at a speed of around 58 kts, there was right roll of 4.57Â° and the aircraft started veering to the right with a noise which felt like a tire burst to the cockpit crew. To maintain directional control first officer moved the tiller. The aircraft vacated via taxiway N9 and stopped on the taxiway with the tail of the aircraft not fully clear of runway 27. Taxiway N9 is about 2600 meters/8550 feet down the runway 27. Flaps were moved to 40, in case if the situation warranted an evacuation. Thereafter, the captain contacted the Jet Airways dispatcher. Also, the APU was started and engine no.2 was shut down, followed by engine no.1.  Meanwhile the airport fire service attended as the ATC controller had observed sparks from the right side of the aircraft after landing. On arrival of passenger stairs, the occupants were safely disembarked through the L1 door and no emergency evacuation was carried out. An investigation revealed that a main landing gear aft trunnion pin had failed as a result of improper grinding during overhaul. Several trunnion pins were overhauled by the same company. The first failure occurred on April 13, 2015 to a Jet Airways Boeing 737-800. During landing rollout at Khajuraho Airport, the left hand main gear aft trunnion pin failed.  According to maintenance records two sets of trunnion pins had been overhauled. As a precautionary measure, on 20 August 2015, the aft trunnion pins of VT-JGC were removed from the aircraft. After the accident involving VT-JGD, it appeared from maintenance records that in fact three sets of trunnion pins (including VT-JGD) had been overhauled by the same company. PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT: The Committee of inquiry determined the cause of accident as ""The RH Aft landing Gear trunnion pin failed due to base metal heat damage as a result of abusive grinding of the chrome plate that likely occurred during the last overhaul"".METAR: 16:00 UTC / 21:30 local time: VABB 031600Z 23007KT 3000 FU FEW100 32/15 Q1013 NOSIG16:30 UTC / 22:00 local time: VABB 031630Z 02003KT 3000 FU FEW100 32/15 Q1013 NOSIG17:00 UTC / 22:30 local time: VABB 031700Z 30006KT 3000 FU NSC 31/15 Q1014 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB India Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Boeing 737-800 VT-JGA 13 April 2015 accident, same cause   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Neither of the 2 flight crew were injured. The flight originated from the Louisville International Airport (SDF), Kentucky. The airplane sustained damage to a 23 foot long section of lower fuselage skin, 4 fuselage stringers, 5 fuselage frames, 3 floor stringers and the tail skid. The replacement of the frames and stringers was considered a major repair. According to the operator, the captain was the pilot flying, and the first officer the pilot monitoring for the flight from SDF-ABQ. Ground operations were normal in SDF and no aircraft loading or Weight and Balance discrepancies were noted. The climb, cruise, and descent portion of the flight were uneventful. Weather conditions at ABQ prior to arrival were reported as visual conditions, with wind from 090 at 20 knots gusting to 29 knots. The target approach speed used was 146 knots. The crew was vectored to the ILS approach to runway 03 and joined the localizer and glideslope using the autopilot. The autopilot was then disengaged at 1103 feet Height Above Touchdown (HAT) and at 1000 feet HAT the approach met all UPS Stabilized Approach criteria with the aircraft fully configured at flaps 30, gear down, and speed 145 knots. At 500 feet HAT the approach continued to meet all stabilized approach criteria with speed 146 knots. Flight data indicated that the crosswind component at this point was 23 knots from the right. At 158 feet above touchdown the approach met all stabilized approach criteria and the captain disconnected the autothrottles. UPS guidance recommends use of the autothrottle until 50 feet above touchdown. From this point on the approach until touchdown, the aircraft pitch attitude began to increase as the airspeed slowly decreased. Flight Data indicates that the thrust levers were at a reduced thrust setting when the autothrottles were disconnected and remained at that setting until touchdown. At 1.75 seconds from touchdown the airspeed had decayed to 129 knots and the aircraft pitch had increased to 7.2 degrees. The crosswind had also decreased and was now 13 knots from the right. At touchdown the airspeed was 128 knots and pitch attitude 8.4 degrees. The tailskid impacted the runway at touchdown followed immediately by the lower aft fuselage as the pitch attitude increased momentarily to 8.6 degrees. Initial tailskid impact occurred at approximately 800 feet from the runway threshold. The crew reported that they encountered a 10 knot wind loss just prior to touchdown and landed firmer than normal, but didn't suspect that they had struck the tailskid. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The pilot flying's failure to maintain airspeed and correct pitch attitude. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's failure to maintain appropriate thrust after disconnecting the autothrottles. Also contributing was the first officer's failure to monitor the decaying airspeed and increasing pitch.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA16CA113 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  7 February 2019 N305UP UPS 0 175 nm NE of Goose Bacy, Canada non Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Albuquerque Sunport Airport, NM (ABQ/KABQ); March 2016; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Three Ukrainian crew members died in the crash and another was critically injured.  The aircraft operated a scheduled cargo flight from Cox's Bazar to Jessore in Bangladesh. The on board cargo consisted of 802 boxes of shrimp weighing 4800 kg. The flight crew requested startup clearance at 02:58 UTC. The aircraft was then cleared to taxi to runway 35 via taxiway S.  Takeoff clearance was given 03:05 UTC.  During takeoff a drop in oil pressure in the torque meter system of engine no.1 caused the engine to lose power the cruise mode. The captain decided to continue takeoff. Immediately after becoming airborne the pilot reported an engine failure and requested for immediate return back to Cox's Bazar Airport. He was advised by ATC to report left hand down wind.  Within 60 seconds after takeoff the no. 1 lost power completely. The captain initially tried to maneuver the aircraft to land on runway 17 (departure runway, opposite direction), but was unable to line up with the runway. The crew decided to continue on a right hand downwind at around 1000 feet with a IAS of 300km/h in clean configuration. The aircraft turned to final and fully configured for landing and stable at around 3.5 NM from the runway. But at 1.2 NM for reasons unknown the captain decided to go around and climbed to 400-500 feet.  ATC advised the captain to report left hand down wind. But there was no response from the crew. The aircraft had impacted the shallow waters on the coast, 3 km West of the airport. Causes: a) Failure to initiate a rejected take off during take off roll following the indication of engine failure; b) Failure to adhere to the company SOP following the detection of the engine failure during take off; c) Considering the poor visibility at Cox's Bazar Airport, diverting to the alternate airfield Chittagong Airport located only 50 nm away that has the provision for full ILS approach facility. This could have helped the crew in carrying out a proper one engine out precision approach landing; d) The aircraft flew at a speed much lower than the clean configuration speed. The aircraft flew at 225 km/h in clean configuration whereas the minimum clean configuration speed is 290 km/hr. e) As per the FDR data the aircraft stalled while making a turn towards the side of the failed engine at a very low altitude;Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIG-BD Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) Hunter_UA; Kirovograd Airport (KGO/UKKG); 08 October 2015 photo (c) Hunter_UA; Kirovograd Airport (KGO/UKKG); 16 October 2014 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

According to flight crew statements, the captain was the flying pilot and the first officer (FO) was the pilot monitoring.Â  The airplane was level at flight level (FL) 270, with the autopilot off, in clear air with noÂ convective activity in the vicinity.Â  Immediately before before beginning the descent into IAH, the flight encountered a momentary pocket of moderate to severe turbulence with the airplane banking approximately 25 Ã¢ÂÂ 30 degrees to the right, and the altitude fluctuating from 100 feet up to 60 - 160 feet down. Â The flight crew did not recall seeing anything on the onboard weather radar or TCAS (traffic collision avoidance system).Â  The captain immediately turned on the seat belt signÂ and made an announcement on the public address for the passengers to fasten their seat belts. Shortly after, the flight crew were informed that a flight attendant FA was injured. The captain called the cabin and was informed thatÂ one of the FAs was severely injured.Â  The flight crew declared a medical emergency and arranged for paramedics to meet the flight at the gate.Â  The FA was transported to a local hospital and diagnosed with serious injuries. According to a weather analysis conducted by United Airlines, satellite imagery indicated no significant cloud features over the route of flight, with the moisture channel imagery indicating moisture channel darkening or drier air in the middle tropospheric levels across the northern half of Texas and southern Los Angeles with increasing moisture further to the south with the stronger jet stream winds.Â Â A review ofÂ pilot reportsÂ (PIREPs) across the region leading up to the turbulence only indicated light turbulence being encountered.Â Â Consequently, The Weather Company forecasts only called for light turbulence for the route.Â Â However, several Aircraft Meteorological Data and Reporting (AMDAR) automated reports across the region indicated that winds were stronger than predicted at higher levels and indicated a strong vertical wind shear at higher levels than originally forecast. Probable Cause: an inadvertent encounter with clear air turbulence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA16CA181 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA16CA181 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  17 February 2014 N23708 United Airlines 0 Kaycee, Wyoming non Turbulence Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates02-Jun-2023 13:51 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

Russell Regional Airport (RMG), Georgia. The pilot was uninjured and the co-pilot received minor injuries.  According to the crew, the automated surface observing system at the airport indicated the winds were variable at 6 knots. They requested and were cleared for the visual approach to runway 7, which was 4,495 feet-long. While in the traffic pattern and abeam the runway numbers, the crew lowered the landing gear and deployed 20 degrees of flaps, followed by 30 degrees on the base leg. On final approach, the crew stated that the turbulence was moderate and the airspeed started fluctuate and decreased to Vref. They responded by adjusting engine power on short final, and noted that ""considerable power"" was necessary to maintain airspeed. The airplane touched down at the Vref speed of 112 kts inside the touchdown zone, but the ground speed appeared to be fast. The crew activated the speed brakes, and the pilot applied the wheel brakes (the airplane was not equipped with thrust reversers). The crew then increased their braking to maximum, and when it was evident that the airplane not going to stop before the end of the runway, they activated the emergency brake. The airplane departed the end of the runway and travelled into the safety area, where it sank into the grass and mud as it continued forward in a slight left turn. The nose landing gear collapsed and the forward fuselage struck the ground resulting in substantial damage to the airframe. The airplane came to rest approximately 350 feet from the departure end of the runway. One of the flight crew members of the aircraft stated to ASN that NO tailwind was involved, contrary to what ASN previously reported based on a statement from an airport spokesman in local media. Instead, N465FL had three previous documented brake failures in the months preceding this accident.METAR: 17:53 UTC / 13:53 local time: METAR KRMG 141753Z AUTO 21012G17KT 10SM FEW044 SCT055 BKN095 22/14 A2977 RMK AO2 SLP074 T02220139 10233 20111 5802018:53 UTC / 14:53 local time: METAR KRMG 141853Z AUTO VRB04KT 10SM SCT043 SCT055 BKN100 24/13 A2975 RMK AO2 SLP067 T0239013319:53 UTC / 15:53 local time: METAR KRMG 141953Z AUTO 23013G21KT 190V260 10SM BKN050 BKN090 OVC110 23/13 A2974 RMK AO2 PK WND 21026/1904 SLP063 T02280128 Sources: NTSB   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The mishap flight was a chartered flight to transport personnel of Pakistan Petroleum Limited from Karachi to Sui. The takeoff weight was within limits. The calculated V1 and V2 speeds were 104 Kts and 106 Kts respectively, whereas the stalling speed was 84 Kts. The captain was Pilot Flying (PF) and the first officer was Pilot Monitoring (PM) for this sector. However, the first officer was a qualified captain on Beechcraft 1900D aircraft. The aircraft taxied out at 08:05 hours local time. The aircraft start up and taxiing was normal. The flight was given runway 25L for takeoff and the aircraft lined up on the runway. After obtaining takeoff clearance, the flight crew completed pre take off checks with no abnormalities observed. At 08:23:06, take off thrust was applied very gradually and the aircraft started to roll. Five seconds after reaching maximum power, at 08:23:35 the PM announced the speed being 80 kts. FDR data indicated an increasing trend in torque and drop in propeller rpm of engine no. 2, which was not monitored by the flight crew. The propeller rpm dropped to a minimum 709 rpm in the next 11 seconds. Also, torque of engine no.1 began to drop, without any significant change in rpm. The aircraft was still rolling for takeoff and accellerating through 95 kts. When the no. 2 engine propeller rpm started to drop, the PF announced that the aircraft began drifting towards the right. The PM replied ""continue...continue"". At 08:23:44 when the aircraft was reaching 96 kts, the PM asked PF to turn left and apply left rudder.  The flight crew did not realize at this stage that there was a problem with both engines and they were still below V1 which, as per pre flight calculation, was 104 kts.  At 08:23:49 the first officer asked the captain to increase the power of the left engine. By this time the drop in no. 1 engine torque had been arrested. It appears that the first officer had a glance on torque indicator and asked the captain to increase power.  At 08:23:53 the captain glanced at the engine instruments and wanted to express his concern about loss of power. Before being able the first officer announced ÂV1...rotateÂ at 08:23:55 and 101 kts of speed. After getting airborne, the aircraft continued to drift towards the right. In order to control the dropping speed and direction loss, the first officer took over the controls. At 08:24:08 when decreasing speed had reached 98 kts the first officer asked the captain to raise the landing gears in order to reduce drag and gain speed. The aircraft had climbed to approximately 39 feet above ground and the captain asked the first officer to lower the nose in order to gain speed. At 08:24:19 when the aircraft was at 101 kts and approximately 41 feet above ground level, the first officer asked the captain to raise the flaps. While the aircraft was losing altitude, the maximum speed of 105 kts was recorded and aircraft was passing through 10 feet above ground level. Also, at this time the first officer asked the captain to reduce left engine power. The first officer judged that there was no option other than to make the aircraft land on the remaining runway. The aircraft hit the runway surface with landing gear retracted, approximately 9000 ft from the beginning of runway 25L. The aircraft continued to drag on the runway while continuously drifting right for 800 ft before departing towards right side on the fair weather strip. After travelling approximately 600 ft on the fair weather strip, the aircraft veered towards the left and came to a final stop on the runway 1050 ft short from end of runway. As the captain was seriously injured, the first officer brought fuel control levers, propeller levers and power levers back; put the battery and generators off after the aircraft came to halt. An immediate evacuation of the passengers was carried out. Cause of Occurrence The investigation therefore, concludes that: 1. Some internal malfunction of the Propeller Governor Part No. 8210-410 Serial No. 2490719 was the cause of experienced uncommanded auto feather. However, exact cause of the occurrence could not be determined. 2. Continuing take off below V1 speed (104kts) after encountering engine malfunction and after takeoff raising flaps below recommended height (400ft AGL) lead to decrease in lift and unsustainability of flight.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: PakCAA Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane was destroyed and the 55 passengers and 7 crew fatally injured. Flight 981 departed Dubai at 18:37 hours UTC on March 18. The en route part of the flight was normal. The flight arrived near Rostov and the crew performed a manual approach to runway 22 with the autopilot disconnected. Weather conditions were poor with a cloud base at 630 meters, wind 230 degrees at 13 meters per second, maximum 18 meters per second, light rain shower, mist, severe turbulence and moderate windshear. At 22:42 UTC (01:42 local time) in the course of the initial approach at a height of 340 meters (1115 feet), the flight received a windshear alert. The flight crew decided to go around and then continued to a holding pattern waiting for improved weather conditions. The flight left the holding pattern at 00:28 UTC (03:28 LT) and descended towards Rostov for another approach to runway 22.  As the crew were proceeding with another manual approach, they decided to go around again at a height of 220 meters (721 feet), 4,5 km before the runway after receiving another windshear alert. They initiated a climb with a vertical speed of up to 20 m/s and setting the engines to maximum takeoff/go-around (TOGA) thrust. In the course of the go-around the crew set flaps to 15Â° and retracted the landing gear. At the height of 1900 ft (approx. 600 m) after reaching the pitch angle of 18Â° the pilot flying pushed on the control column, which led to a decrease in vertical acceleration of up to 0.5, increase in forward speed and, consequently, automatic retraction of flaps from 15Â° to 10Â° at a speed of over 200 knots. The short-term decrease in engine thrust within 3 seconds resulted in decreasing speed and flaps extension to 15Â°, although the following crew inputs to regain maximum takeoff/go-around thrust led to speed increase and reiterated automatic flaps retraction to 10Â°. The flaps remained in the latter configuration until the impact. The pilot flying, by pulling up the control column, continued climbing with a vertical speed of as much as 16 m/s. At a height of 900 m there was a simultaneous control column nose down input and stabilizer nose down deflection from -2,5 deg (6,5 units) to +2,5 deg (1,5 units). The FDR recorded a nose down stabilizer input from the stabilizer trim switch of the control wheel lasting 12 seconds, while the CVR record contains a specific noise of rotation of the trim wheels located on both sides of the central pedestal. As a result the aircraft, having climbed to about 1000 m, turned into descent with a negative vertical acceleration of -1g. The following crew recovery actions did not allow to avoid an impact with the ground. The aircraft hit the runway about 120 m from the threshold with a speed of over 600 km/h and over 50 degrees nose down pitch.

The fatal air accident to the Boeing 737-8KN A6-FDN aircraft occurred during the second go around, due to an incorrect aircraft configuration and crew piloting, the subsequent loss of PICÂs situational awareness in nighttime in IMC. This resulted in a loss of control of the aircraft and its impact with the ground. The accident is classified as Loss of Control In-Flight (LOC-I) occurrence. Most probably, the contributing factors to the accident were: - the presence of turbulence and gusty wind with the parameters, classified as a moderate to-strong ""windshear"" that resulted in the need to perform two go-arounds; - the lack of psychological readiness (not go-around minded) of the PIC to perform the second go-around as he had the dominant mindset on the landing performance exactly at the destination aerodrome, having formed out of the ""emotional distress"" after the first unsuccessful approach (despite the RWY had been in sight and the aircraft stabilized on the glide path, the PIC had been forced to initiate go-around due to the windshear warning activation), concern on the potential exceedance of the duty time to perform the return flight and the recommendation of the airline on the priority of landing at the destination aerodrome; - the loss of the PICÂs leadership in the crew after the initiation of go-around and his ""confusion"" that led to the impossibility of the on-time transition of the flight mental mode from ""approach with landing"" into ""go-around""; - the absence of the instructions of the maneuver type specification at the go-around callout in the aircraft manufacturer documentation and the airline OM; - the crewÂs uncoordinated actions during the second go-around: on the low weight aircraft the crew was performing the standard go-around procedure (with the retraction of landing gear and flaps), but with the maximum available thrust, consistent with the Windshear Escape Maneuver procedure that led to the generation of the substantial excessive nose-up moment and significant (up to 50 lb/23 kg) ""pushing"" forces on the control column to counteract it; - the failure of the PIC within a long time to create the pitch, required to perform go around and maintain the required climb profile while piloting aircraft unbalanced in forces; - the PICÂs insufficient knowledge and skills on the stabilizer manual trim operation, which led to the long-time (for 12 sec) continuous stabilizer nose-down trim with the subsequent substantial imbalance of the aircraft and its upset encounter with the generation of the negative G, which the crew had not been prepared to. The potential impact of the somatogravic ""pitch-up illusion"" on the PIC might have contributed to the long keeping the stabilizer trim switches pressed; - the psychological incapacitation of the PIC that resulted in his total spatial disorientation, did not allow him to respond to the correct prompts of the F/O; - the absence of the criteria of the psychological incapacitation in the airline OM, which prevented the F/O from the in-time recognition of the situation and undertaking more decisive actions; - the possible operational tiredness of the crew: by the time of the accident the crew had been proceeding the flight for 6 hours, of which 2 hours under intense workload that implied the need to make non-standard decisions; in this context the fatal accident occurred at the worst possible time in terms of the circadian rhythms, when the human performance is severely degraded and is at its lower level along with the increase of the risk of errors. The lack of the objective information on the HUD operation (there were no flight tests of the unit carried out into the entire range of the operational G, including the negative ones; the impossibility to reproduce the real HUD readings in the progress of the accident flight, that is the image the pilot was watching with the consideration of his posture in the seat trough the stream video or at the FFS) did not allow making conclusion on its possible impact on the flight outcome.

The aircraft, approached runway 25 for landing at the Rio Grande Airport in good visibility. Wind was 260 degrees at 19 knots. A normal landing was carried out in the first third of the runway. Deceleration started normally but at some point the aircraft maintained its speed.  The pilot proceeded to apply maximum reverse and maximum brakes and the airplane decelerated until a speed of approximately 20-30 kts. It traveled the last 600-800 meters of runway without increasing or reducing speed. Subsequently the pilot-in-command decided to steer the plane off the runway to avoid collision with the ILS system and stopped both engines. The aircraft collided with a mound of earth, causing structural damages. Conclusions of the analysis On a general aviation flight, during landing at the International Airport Governor Ramon Trejo, there was runway excursion 25 on the right side of the runway. The aircraft was stopped by impact against a mound, causing the recorded damage. The reasons for the runway excursion could not be established with certainty due to the lack of solid evidence. However, we were able to identify two factors of relevance to operational safety: - The divergence from the regulations referring to runway margins, which caused the damage to the aircraft. While this deficiency was not related to causality with the accident, influenced the severity of it. - The absence of a brake system failure procedure.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JIAAC Report number: 91845/16 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources: JIAAC   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

After selecting the gear down, the pilots noticed that the nose landing gear was not fully extended and performed a go-around.  Numerous attempts were made to lower the gear as per emergency checklist. The decision was then made by the flight crew to land the aircraft in the configuration that it was jammed in. The aircraft slid down runway 14 coming to rest on the center line near intersection Bravo. The nearby awaiting fire trucks foamed the aircraft and its underbelly to prevent any post-crash fire. Conclusion The Air Accident Investigation Department has determined the probable cause of this accident to be system component failure or malfunction within the nose landing gear operating system. Analysis conducted uncovered that the nose gear was not centered during its transit to the down position, causing the gear to become jammed and never fully extended.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAID Bahamas Report number: AO-16-001208 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  12 February 2016 N273JB Jetblue Airways 0 Boston-Logan International Airport, MA (BOS/KBOS) min Collision with Ground support equipment Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

At 19:45 local time flight ID7703 requested pushback clearance to the Halim Tower controller on frequency 118.6 MHz. The aircraft was parked on parking stand B-2 and was approved to push back.  After the ID7703 completed the pushback, the towing car driver of the towed aircraft requested clearance to Halim Tower Control Unit to reposition from parking stand B-1 to the south apron. The towing car driver was instructed to follow ID7703 and to report when on taxiway C. The communication between the towing car driver and Halim Tower was handled by the assistant controller. The controller heard the communication between the assistant and towing car driver, he recognized the position of the towed aircraft was on the parking stand B-1.  The ID7703 flight crew did not know that there was a towing aircraft behind as communications with the car were on a different frequency. At 19:48, ID7703 received taxi clearance to runway 24 via taxiway C. At 19:50, the controller instructed ID7703 to hold on taxiway C due to an arriving aircraft. The assistant stated that when ID7703 was holding on short taxiway C, the towing car began moving the ATR-42. At 19:53, ID7703 received clearance from controller to enter runway 24 to back track for departure. The aircraft that had just arrived would use parking stand B-1. Therefore, the assistant controller instructed the towing car driver to expedite the tow and report when on taxiway C. The controller was not observing the ATR at that time. The towing car was about to enter taxiway C at that time. At 19:56, ID7703 reported ready for takeoff. The controller did not see any vehicle or object on the runway then issued clearance for takeoff. The pilot stated that during line up, the lights surrounding the turn pad were very bright and affected his forward vision for a short time. It was common practice in Halim to lineup at the turn pad beyond the threshold runway 24. After receiving the takeoff clearance, the Second in Command (SIC) as pilot flying (PF) opened the power and pressed the Take Off / Go Around (TOGA) button. The towing car driver stated that, when he saw ID7703 was lining up for takeoff, he asked Halim Tower whether ID7703 was initiating the takeoff. There was no reply from Halim Tower. The towing car driver then sped up the towing and turned to the right side of the runway. When ID7703 was accelerating through approximate 80 knots, the SIC saw an object warned the captain. The pilots could not identify the object but later on when the object became closer, the SIC realized that there was an aircraft. The captain took over control and applied the right rudder towards the right side of runway centerline and maintained a course between the runway centerline and the runway edge. The PIC intended to reject the takeoff shortly after they felt an impact. The impact occurred at a ground speed of about 130 knots, after passing V1. The pilot rejected takeoff and the aircraft stopped at approximately 400 meter from the towed aircraft which stopped at the left of the runway 24 centerline at approximately 100 meters from taxiway G. The captain noticed fire on the left wing tip and immediately shut down both engines, activated the fire extinguishers of both engines and Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) and commanded to the flight attendant ""evacuation from the right"". The flight attendants opened all aircraft passenger doors and the escape slides deployed. Most of passengers were evacuated from the left forward door (L1). Both aircraft sustained substantial damage. There were no reported injuries to the accident.  The outer portion of the left wing of the Boeing 737, about 5,75 m, was severed. The ATR-42s left hand wing, outboard of the no.1 engine, was severed, along with the entire empennage. Contributing Factors: - Handling of two movements in the same area with different controllers on separate frequencies without proper coordination resulted in the lack of awareness to the controllers, pilots and towing car driver. - The communication misunderstanding of the instruction to follow ID 7703 most likely contributed the towed aircraft enter the runway. - The lighting environments in the tower cab and turning pad area of runway 24 might have diminished the capability to the controllers and pilots to recognize the towed aircraft that was installed with insufficient lightings.METAR: 12:00 UTC / 19:00 local time: WIHH 041200Z 04006KT 5000 HZ FEW017CB SCT018 30/25 Q1010 RMK CB TO SWAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSC Report number: KNKT.16.04.07.04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources: Batik Air statement  NTSC   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSC; Jakarta-Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport (HLP); 04 April 2016 photo (c) Galih Mahastra; Jakarta-Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport (HLP); 2017 photo (c) NTSC; Jakarta-Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport (HLP); 04 April 2016 photo (c) NTSC; Jakarta-Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport (HLP); 04 April 2016 photo (c) NTSC; Jakarta-Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport (HLP); 04 April 2016 photo (c) Leslie Snelleman; Toulouse-Blagnac Airport (TLS/LFBO); 14 September 2014 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Approximately two minutes before 9H-AMZ landed, with the aircraft flying a stabilised final approach about 4 NM from the runway threshold, an Airbus A319 commenced its take-off run from the start of runway 05 and took off around 40 seconds later. The crew of 9H-AMZ flew over the displaced threshold of runway 05 with the correct approach profile and at the correct reference speed, and commenced the flare at a radio altitude of 10 ft. Moments later, the aircraft was caught by a positive wind shear of around 13 kt and rolled into a slight right bank, which the crew countered with an aileron deflection to the left. Immediately afterwards, the aircraft suddenly and severely rolled on its longitudinal axis to a left bank angle of 12.1Â°. The crew immediately countered this with a vigorous aileron deflection to the right. Nevertheless, 9H-AMZ struck the runway with its left wingtip and subsequently touched down with the main landing gear whilst at an almost horizontal bank attitude. The process of slowing down and taxiing from the runway was uneventful.  The occupants of 9H-AMZ were not injured. The aircraft was damaged on the left outer leading-edge slat. Causes The accident, in which a business aircraft touched the runway with one wingtip (wingtip strike), can be attributed to a high bank angle during the landing flare. The most probable cause for this high bank angle was found to be wake turbulence from a commercial aircraft that had previously taken off on the runway, which caused the business aircraft to roll around its longitudinal axis. The accident was caused by the combination of the following factors: - Light wind weather conditions, which delayed the decay of wingtip vortices; - A prolonged landing flare near the ground, which led to a touchdown at the end of the landing zone at low airspeed; - Insufficient distance between the displaced runway threshold and the point of rotation of an aircraft, which had previously taken off.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: STSB Report number: 2359 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 years and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft was attached to the Hiko Tenkentai Flight Check Squadron based at Iruma Air Base. The accident plane took off from Iruma at 08:49 for a check flight to Kanoya Air Base, and after planned check at Kanoya in the morning, it landed at Kanoya at 12:06.  After refueling, the plane took off at 13:15, and performed the remaining check of the JAT TACAN.  At 14:31, the plane began the 'alignment orbit check' following a low pass over runway 08R.  In this check, the plane lost radar contact while flying an anti-clock-wise 6nm arc with an altitude of 3000 feet after climbing from 2500 feet.  The wreckage was found by a search party of Japan Grand Self-Defense Force on 7th April on Ontake peak of Mt. Takakuma, which has an elevation of 1182m (3875 feet). At the time of the accident, the captain acted as Pilot Not Flying and F/O was Pilot Flying. A GPWS warning sounded 12 seconds before the crash, however, the warning was switched off 2 seconds before the crash without any avoidance maneuvers. The cause of the accident was continued flight until the crash on 6nm arc from Kanoya JAT TACAN with an altitude of 3000 feet.  The factors of the accident were: PIC's misidentification on the heights of mountains under the planned flight path, visual obscuration near and/or in the clouds after climbing from 2500 feet to 3000 feet, and no adequate response to the GPWS warning. A contribution factor of insufficient supervision to the flight plan is also identified.Sources: Yahoo Japan  mainichi.jp   Location  Images: photo (c) Esa Kaihlanen; Ibaraki Airport (RJAH); 30 October 2013 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Upon rotation of the aircraft, the crew heard an explosion from the no.1 (left) engine. The pilot noticed that the no.1 engine cover had torn away, hitting the propeller blades. The aircraft began to lose height and speed and the crew decided to perform an emergency landing in a field.  The aircraft struck the ground causing detachment of the propellers and parts of the aircraft. After coming to rest, a post-impact fire started that consumed much of the aircraft.  An inspection of the engine revealed that one of the cylinder heads had broken away. Parts were found near the end of the runway. Probable cause: Wrong application by the crew of the emergency procedure due to engine No. 1 failure, since they reduced the RPM of the operative engine (No. 2), causing the BMEP limit to be exceeded, producing an engine stall (No. 2), making the flight of the plane impossible and forcing the execution of a forced landing.

The aircraft took off from Tekin Airport at 13:56 hours local time on a VFR flight to Kiunga. On board were the pilot-in-command and 11 passengers: eight adults and three infants. In addition to the passengers and their baggage, the aircraft was carrying a significant quantity of vegetables.  The weather at Kiunga was reported to be fine. As the aircraft entered the Kiunga circuit area, the pilot cancelled SARWATCH with Air Traffic Services (ATS). The pilot did not report an emergency to indicate a safety concern. Witnesses reported that during its final approach, the aircraft suddenly pitched up almost to the vertical, the right wing dropped, and the aircraft rolled inverted and rapidly ""fell to the ground"". It impacted the terrain about 1,200 metres west of the threshold of runway 07. The impact was vertical, with almost no forward motion. The aircraft was destroyed, and all occupants were fatally injured. The investigation found that the right-wing fuel tank was empty. There was no evidence of pre- or postimpact fuel leakage. The backing plate behind the fuel selectors was bent during the impact, and had jammed the left selector in its selected position. It appeared that the pilot may have been cross feeding fuel from the left-wing tank to feed the right engine. The aircraft had been reweighed 5 months prior to the accident. The operator had not sought to obtain CASA approval of the new weight and balance data sheet for inclusion in the Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM). There was no evidence that the pilot had computed load distribution within the aircraft. The investigation determined that while the aircraft was within the weight limitations, the load distribution placed it in a significantly aft centre of gravity (c of g) situation for takeoff and landing.  The investigation determined that the right engine had failed, probably subsequent to the SARWATCH broadcast, but sufficiently before the aircraft pitched nose up, in order for the pilot to have had time to wind in full nose-left rudder trim to counteract the aerodynamic forces imposed by the failure of the right engine. Contributing factor: The aircraftÂs centre of gravity was significantly aft of the aft limit. When landing flap was set, full nose-down elevator and elevator trim was likely to have had no effect in lowering the nose of the aircraft. Unless the flaps had been retracted immediately, the nose-up pitch may also have resulted in tailplane stall, exacerbating the pitch up. The wings stalled, followed immediately by the right wing dropping. Recovery from the stall at such a low height was not considered possible. Other factors Other factors is used for safety deficiencies or concerns that are identified during the course of the investigation, that while not causal to the accident, nevertheless should be addressed with the aim of accident and serious incident prevention, and the safety of the travelling public. a) Following the reweighing of SBC, the operator did not make adjustments to account for the shift of the moment arm as a result of the reweighing. Specifically, a reduction of allowable maximum weight in the baggage compartment. b) The pilot, although signing the flight manifest on previous flights attesting that the aircraft was loaded within c of g limits, had not computed the c of g. No documentation was available to confirm that the pilot had computed the c of g for the accident flight, or any recent flights. c) All of the High Frequency radio transmissions between Air Traffic Services and SBC were significantly affected by static interference and a lot of hash, making reception difficult, and many transmissions unclear and unreadable. This is a safety concern to be addressed to ensure that vital operational radio transmissions are not missed for the safety of aircraft operations, and the travelling public.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIC PNG Report number: AIC 16-1002 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  23 April 2014 P2-SBC Sunbird Aviation PNG 0 Kikori Airport (KRI) sub Runway excursion Location  Images: photo (c) Flite Sefti; Kiunga Airport (UNG/AYKI); 23 April 2016 photo (c) Flite Sefti; Kiunga Airport (UNG/AYKI); 23 April 2016 photo (c) PNG AIC; near Kiunga Airport (UNG/AYKI); 13 April 2016 photo (c) PNG AIC; near Kiunga Airport (UNG/AYKI); 13 April 2016 photo (c) PNG AIC; near Kiunga Airport (UNG/AYKI); April 2016 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft, a Beechcraft 1900D, was scheduled to depart Goose Bay Airport at 19:20 and arrive at the Gander at 20:54. The flight was operated by Exploits Valley Air Services. Before departing, the captain checked the weather at Gander and the alternate airport, Deer Lake Airport (CYDF). The visibility at Gander was 1/8 statute miles (sm) in heavy snow. The weather forecast for the time of arrival was wind 360Â° magnetic (M) at 35 knots, gusting to 55 knots; visibility 1/4 sm in heavy snow and blowing snow; vertical visibility 100 feet above ground level (agl). Starting at 22:30, the visibility was forecast to increase to 1/2 sm in moderate snow and blowing snow, and the vertical visibility was to improve to an overcast ceiling at 400 feet agl. A significant meteorological information (SIGMET) message was issued indicating severe turbulence below 3000 feet agl over an area of Newfoundland that included Gander. The crew planned to conduct the instrument landing system with distance measuring equipment precision approach for runway 03 (ILS/DME RWY 03) at Gander.  The captain called the company's acting operations manager to discuss the potential operational impact if the flight had to divert to its alternate. At first, the intent was to delay the flight for an hour to wait for the snowfall intensity to diminish and for the visibility to improve. However, after speaking with the acting operations manager, the captain decided to depart as scheduled, anticipating that the weather conditions would improve by the time they reached Gander. The crew was unaware that other carriers had cancelled their flights to Gander.  The aircraft departed at 19:45 on an instrument flight rules flight plan. There were 14 passengers and 2 crew members on board. The first officer (F/O) was the pilot flying. While en route, the F/O indicated that he did not feel comfortable conducting the approach and landing due to his limited experience and the potential challenges associated with the anticipated weather conditions. The captain agreed to conduct the approach and landing. During the flight, the crew received updated weather reports from both the Gander Area Control Centre and Gander Tower, which indicated an increase in visibility from 1/8 sm to 1/2 sm and a reduction in the snowfall intensity from heavy to light. The crew decided that the visibility was sufficient to conduct the approach as initially planned. The winds and blowing snow were not identified as concerns. While the flight was en route, snow removal was in progress at Gander. The airport plows were focused on clearing the middle 120 feet of the 200-foot-wide runway. The plows had pushed the snow into windrows along both sides of the runway, about 60 feet from the centreline. The crew contacted the tower controller for the runway surface condition report. The latest runway condition report for runway 03, taken at 2044, was as follows: 120 feet cleared width, 40% dry snow with a depth of 0.13 inches and 60% bare and dry; remaining width 100% dry snow with a depth of 4 inches; remarks - windrows along reported width with a depth of 10 inches. The snowplows continued plowing the runway until about 21:10, at which point they began to plow a path for the aircraft to follow from the runway to the apron. On the approach, about 12 minutes before touchdown, the aircraft began to encounter moderate turbulence through 5700 feet above sea level. This turbulence continued until landing and was significant enough that the passengers were experiencing discomfort. Once the aircraft intercepted the localizer, control of the aircraft was transferred to the captain as planned. The landing gear was lowered and the flaps were set to full, as per the company's standard operating procedures. At 21:24, the tower controller cleared flight 7804 to land and provided the crew with the current tower winds of 360Â°M at 36 knots, gusting to 44 knots. The crew acquired the runway approach lighting at about 800 feet agl, more than 2 nautical miles (nm) from the threshold. At approximately 21:30, while on short final, the crew asked for a wind update. The tower controller informed the crew that the tower winds were currently unavailable and provided the last aerodrome special meteorological report (SPECI), which had been taken 18 minutes before. The SPECI indicated that the winds were 350Â°M at 29 knots, gusting to 41 knots. In the landing flare, the captain asked the F/O to call out the heights on the radar altimeter to help them determine how high they were above the ground. Almost immediately, the 10- and 0-foot calls were made. There was no indication that the crew lost visual contact with the runway edge lighting. At about 21:30, the aircraft touched down on its main landing gear (MLG) to the right of the centreline at a normal descent rate and in a relatively flat attitude about 2800 feet from the threshold. The crew was unaware how far to the right of the centreline they were when they touched down. Almost immediately, the aircraft veered to the right when the right-side MLG encountered snow. The nose landing gear (NLG) struck the windrow of compacted snow, which caused the NLG to collapse. As the aircraft's nose began to drop, the propeller blades struck the snow and runway surface. All of the left-side propeller blades and 3 of the right-side propeller blades separated at the blade root. A portion of a blade tip from the right-side propeller penetrated the cabin wall at floor level. The aircraft slid down the runway, with the nose coming within 27 feet of the runway edge, before crossing back through the windrow toward the centreline. The aircraft came to a stop about 14 seconds after touchdown on a heading of about 350Â°M. The nose was about 15 feet to the right of the centreline and 3400 feet from the threshold. Once the aircraft came to a stop, the F/O opened the cabin door and evacuated the passengers. The captain shut down the engines. The tower controller did not have any ground radar and was unaware that the aircraft was stopped on the runway. The captain contacted the tower controller to report the situation and request assistance. The tower controller immediately activated the crash bell. The first fire truck left the station within 1 minute of the crash bell being activated. About 2 minutes later, the plow drivers, who were cross-trained as fire rescue personnel, drove the remaining 2 fire trucks and the rescue vehicle to the aircraft. Because the location of the aircraft was not known, the vehicles started at the north end of runway 03. They proceeded cautiously because of the reduced visibility from blowing snow and because the passengers were out on the runway. The first fire truck arrived at the aircraft about 6 minutes after the accident. In total, 3 fire trucks, 1 rescue vehicle, and 2 pickup trucks responded. Once the firefighters established that there was no fire, the rescue vehicle and pickup trucks started transporting passengers to the terminal. Within 25 minutes of the crash bell being activated, all passengers and crew had been transported to the terminal. Three passengers sustained minor injuries. None of the injuries were attributed to the portion of the propeller blade that had penetrated the cabin. Findings as to causes and contributing factors: 1. Neither pilot had considered that the combination of landing at night, in reduced visibility, with a crosswind and blowing snow, on a runway with no centreline lighting, was a hazard that may create additional risks. 2. The blowing snow made it difficult to identify the runway centreline markings, thereby reducing visual cues available to the captain. This situation was exacerbated by the absence of centreline lighting and a possible visual illusion caused by blowing snow. 3. Due to the gusty crosswind conditions, the aircraft drifted to the right during the landing flare, which was not recognized by the crew. 4. It is likely that the captain had difficulty determining aircraft position during the landing flare. 5. The flight crew's decision to continue with the landing was consistent with plan continuation bias. 6. During landing, the nosewheel struck the compacted snow windrow on the runway, causing the nose landing gear to collapse.METAR: 00:00 UTC / 21:30 local time: METAR CYQX 210000Z CCB 33036G52KT 1/2SM R03/2800V5000FT/N R13/3000V5500FT/N -SN BLSN OVC007 M03/M04 A2930 RMK BLSN6SF2 /S33/SLP931=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A16A0041 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: CADORS  Air Canada   Location  Images: photo (c) Transportation Safety Board of Canada; Gander Airport, NF (YQX/CYQX); 20 April 2016; (CC:by-nc-nd) photo (c) Transportation Safety Board of Canada; Gander Airport, NF (YQX/CYQX); 20 April 2016; (CC:by-nc-nd) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane sustained substantial damage and there were no reported injuries among the 6 crew and 87 passengers onboard. The aircraft departed Quito at 06:51 hours local time.  During the landing preparation briefing, at 07:34, the pilot indicated that they would hold the glide slope until they had a runway in sight, inhibit the glide slope alarm, and continue visual. Four minutes later the flight was cleared for the VOR ILS ZULU approach for runway 23. The runway was wet due to drizzle and the braking efficiency reported by an Airbus A319 was good to average. The A319 had landed on the runway in Cuenca 36 minutes before flight 173.  At 07:46, the flight radioed that they were ten miles out and established on the localizer. They were cleared to the ILS approach for runway 23. Three minutes later the controller reported that they had flight 173 in sight and informed that the wind was calm, and cleared the flight to land on runway 23. T At 07:50, the pilot indicated that he had three red and one white lights on the PAPI system.  The aircraft crossed the runway threshold at 37 feet high instead of 50 feet, which meant the aircraft approached below the normal glidepath. It touched down 277 m past the threshold at an airspeed of 127 knots. Spoilers were deployed 585 meters from the threshold, followed by reverses at 643 m. The pilot, not feeling an effective braking of the aircraft, tried to activate the autobrake system but this did not work. The aircraft was hydroplaning and could not be brought to a halt on the runway. The pilot groundlooped the aircraft on the grass. Runway 23 is a 1900 m long runway with an upslope of 15 m (+0.78%). Distance from the centre of the end of the paved runway to the boundary fence and an active road is 31 m.	The Operational Landing Distance calculations with manual braking for the weight of the aircraft with wind on touchdown, indicate that a runway length of 2,122 meters was necessary. PROBABLE CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS (translated from Spanish language report) The Accident Investigation Board determines that the probable causes of this accident were: 1. The condition of the runway at Cuenca airport, which at the time of the plane's landing was contaminated with water and slippery. 2. The landing was made after a non-stabilized approach with a tailwind. 3. The non-application of the Maximum Performance Landing procedure recommended by the aircraft manufacturer for landing on contaminated runways. The following factors contributed to this event: 1. The dispatch of the flight with 1,500 kg of fuel more than the amount of fuel usually used for this flight. 2. Omission of the runway length calculation necessary to perform the landing using the braking efficiency information. 3. The crew's decision to make the final approach with three red and one white lights, using the PAPI system, induced by the information in the Terminal Information document issued by the company, which authorised this procedure. 4. The use of confusing terminology in the Terminal Information document, which used terms applicable to the Airbus fleet, instead of Embraer's. 5. The crew's decision not to perform the thwarted approach maneuver after the maximum allowable vertical speed was exceeded and visibility was apparently limited after the minima were exceeded. 6. Incorrect use of aircraft braking aids, in this case reverse braking aids 7. The application of the emergency brake that inhibits the antiskid system. 8. Lack of implementation of adequate management of crew resources, particularly within the cockpit. 9. Lack of training in the use of tables for track distance calculation.METAR: 12:00 UTC / 07:00 local time: SECU 281200Z 35003KT 9999 -RA FEW010 OVC030 13/12 Q102713:00 UTC / 08:00 local time: SECU 281300Z 33003KT 8000 -RA FEW010 OVC030 13/12 Q1028Wind: 330 degrees at 3 knots; visibility 8000 m in light rain; few clouds at 1000 feet, overcast at 3000 feet; Temperature 13Â°C; Dew point 12Â°C; QNH 1028 mbAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: JIA Ecuador Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Cuenca Airport statement  aerospotter.blogspot.com   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft, a Fokker 50, operated by Amapola Flyg on behalf of Air VallÃ©e, departed Rimini at 08:49 on a domestic service to Catania. The aircraft was approaching runway 08 at Catania Airport when the nose landing gear failed to deploy. The approach was abandoned about 10:37 hours. The airplane climbed to 2900 feet and entered a holding pattern to the east of the airport while the crew tried to troubleshoot the problem.  Finally a forced landing was carried out on runway 08 at 11:34 with the nose gear doors open but the nose gear retracted. CAUSES   The accident was caused by the failure of the nose landing gear (nose gear up) due to over-extension of the shock absorber which caused interference between the tires and the NLG compartment and locked the NLG in a retracted position.  The over-extension was caused by the incorrect installation of some internal components of the shock absorber during the replacement of the internal seals the day before the accident.   The following factors contributed significantly to the improper activity conducted at maintenance:  - the insufficient experience of technical personnel in carrying out the maintenance tasks conducted on the NLG;  - the lack of controls on the operations carried out, deemed unnecessary by the CAMO engineering department;  - the lack of definition of roles and tasks during the planning phase of the maintenance work;  - the operational pressure on maintenance personnel, arising from the need to conclude maintenance operations quickly in order not to penalize the management of the aircraft;  - the insufficient clarity and lack of sensitive information in the maintenance tasks and related figures contained in the AMM, regarding the replacement of internal shock absorber seals, subsequently made clearer by the manufacturer;  - the reported black and white printing of the applied AMM procedures, which could have made the warnings in the manual barely legible.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ANSV Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 years and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: ANSV  Repubblica.it  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane was operated by the pilot as a familiarization flight. The commercial pilot and sole passenger were not injured. The airplane departed the Upland-Cable Airport, California, about 11:45.  The pilot stated to the NTSB that the flight was a familiarization flight for a new member of their chapter of the Commemorative Air Force. The flight departed the Cable airport and flew east along the mountains, headed to San Bernardino. They contacted the San Bernardino tower and were instructed to enter the crosswind for runway 24. As part of the before landing checklist, the pilot turned on the carburetor heat and switched the fuel tank selector to the right fuel tank. Shortly thereafter, the engine lost all power. The pilot attempted numerous times to restart the engine, but was unsuccessful.  The pilot realized that he would not be able to reach the airport, and decided to make a forced landing to a small field in a residential area. During the landing approach, the airplane contacted a power line. After touching down in the field the airplane nosed over and came to rest inverted, which resulted in substantial damage to the wings and fuselage. During the postaccident examination of the airplane, about 16 ounces of water were removed from the fuel system.  Water was present in the lower gascolator, the fine fuel filter (upper gascolator), and subsequent fuel line to the carburetor inlet.  A brass screen at the carburetor inlet and 2 carburetor fuel bowl thumb screens also contained corrosion, water, and rust.   The approved aircraft inspection checklist called for washing the carburetor and main fuel filter every 50 hours and cleaning and/or replacing the fine fuel filter every 100 hours.  The fine fuel filter is not easily accessible and not able to be drained during a preflight inspection. The mechanic who completed the most recent inspection stated that he did not drain or check the fine fuel filter. The last logbook entry that specifically stated the fuel filters were cleaned was about 4 years before the accident. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The mechanicÂs failure to inspect the fine fuel filter gascolator as required during the most recent inspection, which resulted in a total loss of engine power due to fuel contamination.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: WPR16LA101 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 12 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft departed Delhi Airport as flight 9W2793 at 17:40 local time (12:10 UTC). While en route ATIS was obtained by the crew approximately at 115 NM from Indore and the arrival briefing was completed at 100 NM from Indore. The crew asked ATC for permission to descend at 19:10, much before their descent point, so as to keep clear of weather and avoid turbulence. The winds reported by ATC were 130Â° and 08 knots. As the winds were favourable for runway 07 the crew decided for a VOR approach to runway 07 via DME arc. At 19:23 crew reported commencing the arc. While on final approach the crew asked for winds, ATC informed crew that the winds were 320Â° and 12 knots. The crew also saw tail winds on their Primary Flight Display (PFD) and decided to discontinue the approach. ATC then cleared the aircraft for an ILS approach to runway 25 from overhead. The crew then requested an ILS approach to runway 25 via the DME arc, as there was weather overhead. This was accepted by ATC at 19:31. At the same time ATC also informed crew that winds were then 100Â° and 12 knots. The aircraft climbed 4000 feet and was kept left of the runway, keeping runway in visual contact. The crew continued with the approach and went out for 15 NM to avoid weather before turning right to intercept the ILS. The flight reported established on localizer at 19:37 and was informed by ATC of moderate rain on airfield. At 19:38 crew reported intercepting ILS and was cleared to land with reported winds of 13 knots at 160Â°. As per the statement of crew the approach was clear and runway lights could be seen from 13 NM. The runway lights and PAPI lights appeared bright and hence the crew requested ATC to reduce the intensity of the lights. As the aircraft descended through 600 feet, auto pilot was disconnected. After the aircraft touched down, it veered to the right. The PIC tried to control the aircraft using rudder to turn it to the left. However aircraft went excessively to the left. The PIC was also warned by the co-pilot about the aircraft heading. The aircraft continued going left even after application of full right rudder by the PIC. The aircraft subsequently went out of the runway into the unpaved surface on left, damaging runway edge lights, runway marking light and a taxiway edge light. The aircraft travelled approximately 180 meters on the unpaved surface while jumping a pit and crossing taxiway F near the isolation bay before coming to halt 78 meters away from runway centre line, with heading 204Â°. Probable cause of the Accident: Improper cross wind landing technique and failure to use nose wheel steering or differential braking after rudder efficiency was diminished due to decreasing speed caused the aircraft to veer out of runway. The runway condition was a contributory factor.METAR: 13:00 UTC / 18:30 local time: VAID 071300Z 10009KT 5000 -TS FEW020 SCT025 FEWCB030 33/16 Q1009 NOSIG15:00 UTC / 20:30 local time: VAID 071500Z 18014KT 5000 -TS FEW020 SCT025 FEWCB030 27/19 Q1010 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB India Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources: Images: photo (c) AAIB India; Indore Airport (IDR); 07 May 2016 photo (c) AAIB India; Indore Airport (IDR); 07 May 2016 photo (c) AAIB India; Indore Airport (IDR); 07 May 2016 photo (c) Flightradar24; Indore Airport (IDR); 07 May 2016 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane sustained substantial damage. The pilot, flight instructor, and two passengers were uninjured. The airplane was operated as an instructional flight that was not operating on a flight plan. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight that last departed from Jonesboro Municipal Airport, Arkansas at 16:50 and was destined to DXE. The pilot stated that the purpose of the flight was a Beechcraft B100 initial training flight with a second pilot who occupied the right pilot seat. According to the Federal Aviation Administration inspector, the flight instructor was in a non-seated position between both pilots. The left seat pilot stated that they flew about 3 hours and had taken turns performing turns, stalls, slow flight and approaches. He stated that the accident landing was the third landing of the day that he performed. He said that during the left downwind approach for landing on runway 18, he performed the airplane checklist items that the flight instructor read to him. The left seat pilot said that the landing gear extended, and the three landing gear position indicator lights illuminated green. The left seat pilot said that during touchdown, the right side of the airplane descended lower than the left side and then the right main landing gear collapsed. The airplane veered off and into a grass area adjacent to the runway. The aircraft came to rest approximately 2,518 feet from runway 18 touchdown end and 100 feet west of the runway edge in a field of grass. The right hand main gear was collapsed, right hand prop blades were bent and the right wing leading edge and tip was damaged. Evidence of fuel leakage was noted surrounding the right wing in the grass. The wing top skin outboard of the engine nacelle displayed evidence of wrinkling. Post-accident examination revealed the bottom right wing skin to the integral fuel tank was torn resulting in an approximate five by three inch hole. The right main gear actuator assembly exhibited numerous bent parts and was broken out of its mounting structure. The inboard top actuator mounting structure was torn away from the airframe. The right nacelle fuel tank bulkhead was ruptured with the top of the gear actuator resting inside the tank area. The top wing skin wrinkling was not as evident post recovery but still shows signs of damage. Puncture damage to the fuselage pressure vessel was noted in 5 places below the copilot side window and a two-inch crack or tear was found on the belly skin approximately centered between the main gear legs. The rigging for the landing gear system could not be checked nor could functional gear swing test be performed due to damage incurred to the system from the accident. The accident aircraft, N86TR, was involved in a gear-up landing incident On November 17, 2005 at Fulton County Airport, Atlanta.

Seven of the nine occupants suffered fatal injuries. The crew planned to fly from Baku (Azerbaijan) to Bagram (Afghanistan), Dwyer (Afghanistan), Mary (Turkmenistan) and then back to Baku. The flight legs to Dwyer Airport were uneventful.  At 13:11 the crew started the engines on the apron at Dwyer Airport. Engine no.2 was the last to be started up at 13:47 hours. Before the takeoff the captain distributed the duties within the crew, nominating the first officer as the Pilot Flying, and himself as Pilot Monitoring. After the engine startup the crew initiated taxiing to perform takeoff on runway 23. The concrete runway at Dwyer measured 2439 m by 37 m.  In the course of the takeoff preparations, at 13:57:56 the flight mechanic reported an increase in MGT of engine no.3 above the acceptable level: ""Engine 3, look, engine temperature over six hundred, over seven hundred"", which was confirmed by the first officer: ""Yes, itÂs getting temperature"" while the captain asked to be more attentive. The takeoff was performed with Flaps 15. As the checklist was being read, the captain ordered to lock the propellers. After the captain's order to lock the propellers a slight increase in torque values was recorded on engine no.1 and 4, and in 17 seconds also engine no.2. There was no evidence that the propeller of engine no.3 was locked. At 13:59:42 the crew initiated the takeoff. Before the takeoff the ATC advised the crew on the wind direction and speed on the runway: 280Â° 14 knots (7 m/sec) gusting 26 knots (13 m/sec). Thus it was quartering headwind and the headwind component might have been 5 to 9 m/sec. While performing takeoff the crew first increased thrust on engines no.1 and no.4 and then on engine no.2 after 10 seconds. The thrust of the three engines was about 50 kg/sq.cm as per torque indicator (lower than takeoff mode). The third engine was still operating in the ground idle mode, though the CVR did not record any crew callouts concerning engine no.3 operation parameters. Based on the CCTV system of Dwyer Airport the takeoff roll was initiated almost from the runway threshold and was conducted to the left of the runway centerline. No significant deviations from the takeoff course during the takeoff roll were recorded. During the takeoff roll the rudder was deflected left close to extreme. Probably the pilots were also applying differential control on engine no.2 to decrease the right torque moment. At 14:00:14 at approximately 120 km/h IAS the ""Engine no.3 negative thrust"" signal started. At that time the aircraft was about 430 m away from the start of the takeoff roll. At 14:00:42 engines no.1 and no.4 thrust was increased up to 63 kg/sq.cm as per torque indicator (consistent with takeoff mode for the actual flight conditions). At that time the IAS was about 150 km/h. Engine no.2 thrust was increased up to the same value only 23 seconds later at about 200 km/h IAS. At that time the aircraft was about 840 m away from the runway end. Engine no.3 was still operating in ground idle mode. Approximately 260 m before the runway end at a speed of 220 km/h IAS (maximum speed reached) nose up input on the control column was started. The aircraft did not lift off. After rolling all along the runway the aircraft overran the runway onto the ground at a speed of 220 km/h. While moving on the ground the aircraft sustained significant damage, which led to a post-crash fire that destroyed most of the aircraft structures. Out of the nine persons on board seven were killed and two were seriously injured and taken to hospital. The accident with the An-12B 4K-AZ25 aircraft was caused by the decision of the crew to take off with a failed engine No. 3, the propeller of which was not feathered. During the entire takeoff run, engine No. 3 remained at ground idle, as a result of which the engine propeller created a negative thrust that increased as the speed increased, preventing the crew from reaching the take-off speed of the aircraft from the runway. The crew did not take measures to stop the takeoff, which led to the aircraft overrunning the runway at a speed of 220 km/h, its destruction, followed by fire.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: APA  Stripes.com  MAK   Location  Images: photo (c) MAK; Dwyer Airport (DWR); May 2016 photo (c) MAK; Dwyer Airport (DWR); 18 May 2016 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Flight MS804 departed Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport, France, at 21:21 UTC (23:21 hours local time on May 18). Scheduled departure time was 22:45 LT. Destination of the flight was Cairo, Egypt. At 23:22 UTC the flight entered Greek airspace at FL370. Last radio contact was at 23:48 UTC during a radio frequency change. At 00:25:24 UTC a hissing sound was heard in the cockpit, followed by a 'pop' and a second hissing sound. The captain, copilot and a flight attendant sitting in the jump seat all exclaimed ""fire!"". The copilot then called for a fire extinguisher. From 00:25:58 UTC on the Flight Data Recorder began logging multiple warnings, like 'Lavatory smoke', 'Avionic smoke', and Master Warnings. This continued with additional warnings and errors until the end of the recording. At 00:27:23, ATC instructed the flight to contact Cairo ACC, but no reply was received. The aircraft suddenly taking a 90 degree turn left, followed by a 360 degree turn to the right as it descended from FL370 to FL150 before disappearing off radars. The aircraft impacted the surface of the sea. The Flight Data Recorder and Cockpit Voice Recorder were both recovered from the sea bed on June 16, 2016.  The Egyptian AAID published its final report on October 30, 2024, concluding: Probable cause The aircraft flight path was uncontrollable as the aircraft and the flight crew were severely affected by fire and smoke. This resulted from the effects of the explosive materials located at the forward galley just behind the rear section of the cockpit. The aircraft crashed into the sea. Contributing factors - The fire/smoke event took place very quickly and flight crew were disabled. - Several aircraft systems failure. - Explosion resulted in oxygen flow in the cockpit, which enriched the fire/ smoke. BEA France commented on the EAAID's findings and remarked: The factual accuracy of the report is questionable, and the reasoning for the scenarios appears to distort the facts. The report repeatedly mentions the presence of French experts concerning the discovery of TNT. The BEA would like to emphasize that the French experts acted as advisors and observers and had neither the role nor the possibility of validating any findings concerning the presence of explosives on human remains. The French experts involved indicated that the results obtained do not allow for a definitive conclusion regarding the presence of TNT. However, the presence of TNT is never questioned and is taken as an assumption or even as a starting point in all scenario analyses. This leads to an unrealistic scenario incompatible with the sequence of warnings, failures and crew announcements. The BEA disagrees with the scenario established by the investigation committee and maintains the conclusions drawn from its study: The accident sequence began while the aeroplane was cruising at FL370, with a cabin crew member present in the cockpit, the captain resting in his seat and the co-pilot flying. It has not been possible to precisely explain the start of the accident sequence. It is likely to have been an oxygen flow resulting either from a component failure (in the oxygen storage box or in the upstream distribution system) or from pressing the EMERGENCY knob on the co-pilot's oxygen mask. A fire then started in the mask storage box, and was fed by a leak of pressurised oxygen. It has not been possible to determine which came first: the fire or the oxygen leak. Whichever the case, the oxygen-fed fire spread to the outside of the storage box. This type of fire is rapid, large-scale and uncontrollable. It produces a characteristic noise comparable to that of a blowtorch. The protective and extinguishing equipment items in the cockpit were not sufficient to bring the fire under control. The fire damaged the computer power supply systems, which led to the disconnection of the autopilot in particular. No crew actions were recorded in the cockpit. It has not been possible to determine whether the crew remained in the cockpit, whether they were unconscious or whether they fled the fire and then returned or remained outside the cockpit. The aeroplaneâs flight path was uncontrolled and the aircraft collided with the sea.

All 319 onboard were evacuated on the runway using emergency slides from right side doors.  No serious injuries were found among 302 passengers and 17 crew members, however, 19 had medical treatments for smoke inhalation and/or bruises during evacuation, 12 sent to hospital. The accident runway were closed for five and a half hours, and three remaining runways were also closed for two hours. This incident caused more than 400 of other commercial flights to be cancelled, as well as many more diversions, delays and returns to the destination. Probable Causes It is highly probable that the causes of this accident were the fracture of the high pressure turbine (HPT) disk of the No.1 (left-side) engine during the takeoff ground roll, the penetration of the fragment through the engine case and the occurrence of subsequent fires. Regarding the cause for the 1st stage HPT disk to be fractured, it is probable that a step was machined exceeding the allowable limit when machining U-shaped groove on the aft side of the 1st stage HPT disk to manufacture the engine and from this step the low-cycle fatigue crack was initiated and propagated during running of engine. Regarding why the step could not be found, it is somewhat likely that defects failed to be detected at the time of the inspection by the manufacturer during the production process. And as for the cracks that were not found, it is somewhat likely that those cracks failed to be detected at non-destructive inspection on the disk by the Company at the time of maintenance of the engine in use. Regarding the fire breakout from the No.1 engine, it is probable that due to the impact forces generated by the release of the fragment from the ruptured rim part of the 1st stage HPT disk through the engine case and the engine rundown loads generated when the engine stopped suddenly, the cracks were developed in the outer case of the Fuel Oil Heat Exchanger and the fuel and engine oil leaking through these cracks contacted the hot area of engine cases of the No.1 engine to be ignited.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JTSB Report number: AA2018-5 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Images: photo (c) JTSB; Tokyo-Haneda Airport (HND); 27 May 2016 photo (c) JTSB; Tokyo-Haneda Airport (HND); 27 May 2016 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were no injuries among the five passengers and three crew members. The aircraft operated on a flight from Krasnodar to Neryungri with an en route stop at Tyumen. The night time approach was conducted with a visibility of 10+ km. Wind was from 350Â° at 2 m/s. There were broken clouds at 190 m and overcast with cumulonimbus clouds at 510 m. Temperature and dew point were both +4Â°C. QFE pressure was 685 mm Hg (913 hPa). During the descent the air traffic controller informed the crew that QFE (field elevation) pressure was 685 mm Hg and QNH (sea level) pressure was 1012 hPa. The flight crew radioed: ""I confirm 685, [...] is 1012 hectopascals, do we understand it correctly?"" To which the controller replied ""...QNH 1012, for information the height of the threshold is 08, 857 meters."" This was misunderstood by the flight crew. They did not convert the pressure at the runway level of 685 mm Hg to hectopascals (685 mm Hg corresponds to 913 hPa), but instead set the pressure at 1012 hPa on the altimeters and continued the descent. At 23:13:33 hours the EGPWS sounded: ""Sink rate"", followed a second later by ""Caution terrain!"" At 23:13:36 hours the EGWS again sounded: ""PULL UP"". At 23:13:53 hours, at a distance of 18 km from the threshold of runway 08, the aircraft impacted trees. The flight crew managed to regain height and performed a safe landing at Neryungri Airport. A post-flight inspection revealed damage to the wing leading edges and winglets, dents on the no.2 engine cowling, dents to the flaps and right hand horizontal stabilizer. Contributing factors (Translated from Russian): - Insufficient preparation of the crew for the flight, expressed in the fact that the crew did not have the Neryungri airfield (Chulman) ATIS frequency and had a lack of knowledge of the AIP requirements about the additional request to the ATC controller to obtain aerodrome pressure in hectopascals. There were no reference data on the Neryungri airfield (Chulman) in the airlineÂs Operations Manual; - Inattention of the crew in interpreting the QNH and QFE pressures transmitted by the controller to the aircraft; - The Standard Operating Procedures for the Air Traffic Controllers of the Neryungri Air Traffic Service Centre did not contain specific instructions for the adjustment of the Complex of the Automatic Air Traffic Control System ""Alpha""  - The Standard Operating Procedures of the Neryungri (Chulman) airport control tower did not contain control procedures for the assigned flight altitude on the descent and approach of the aircraft.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: MAK  Ministry of Transport RF   Location  Images: photo (c) MAK; Neryungri Airport (NER); June 2016 photo (c) MAK; Neryungri Airport (NER); June 2016 photo (c) MAK; Neryungri Airport (NER); June 2016 photo (c) MAK; Neryungri Airport (NER); June 2016 photo (c) MAK; Neryungri Airport (NER); June 2016 photo (c) MAK; Neryungri Airport (NER); June 2016 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft, an McDonnell Douglas MD-11F cargo plane was bound for Anchorage, Alaska.  The aircraft's takeoff weight was 629,600 lbs, which was below the maximum allowable take-off weight of 630,500 lbs. The flight was cleared for takeoff from runway 33L. The aircraft reached V1 speed after a ground run of 6413 feet. About that time the crew heard a noise, originating from the failure of the no.9 tire (the left-hand tire on the central landing gear). The no.10 tire on the same landing gear also ruptured. Vibration and torsion forces then caused the lower drag brace of the central landing gear to break. The drag brace then hit the body several times. This caused a rupture of the hydraulic system of brake system 1, reducing the total brake efficiency to about 48% as the crew rejected the takeoff. With 4,635 feet of runway remaining the aircraft began to decelerate. The aircraft required a deceleration distance of at least about 5,550ft from the position where the takeoff was rejected. As a result, the MD-11 stopped at approximately 1,591 ft (485 m) past the end of the runway 33L. The nose gear collapsed and the no. 1 and 3 engines contacted the grass. The ARAIB investigators noted that there is an inherent difficulty in determining the flight performance of an aircraft after V1 when limited information and little time is available to the crew for a go/no-go decision. The UPS flight operations manual states that after V1, rejecting takeoff is not recommended unless the captain judges that aircraft can not fly, but the manual does not establish a definition of 'non-flying'. ARAIB notes that it would be beneficial for the aviation industry to provide flight crews with definitions of 'non-flightability' and additional guidance and training as to how to judge aircraft flight performance under certain circumstances, especially after V1. CAUSE (translated from Korean): After the take-off determination speed (V1), the high-speed takeoff abandonment is performed by the tire of the central landing gear and the drag brace defect, and the runway is separated. Contributing factor is "" (1) For limited time and available information on the encountered situation, (2) Dynamic instability of dragging of central landing gear after tire failure. (3) Decrease in braking performance due to rupture of hydraulic pipe of brake system 1 "".METAR: 13:30 UTC / 22:30 local time: RKSI 061330Z 36001KT 9000 SCT040 BKN120 19/14 Q1012 NOSIG14:00 UTC / 23:00 local time: RKSI 061400Z 36002KT 9000 SCT040 BKN120 20/14 Q1012 NOSIG14:30 UTC / 23:30 local time: RKSI 061430Z 28003KT 250V320 9000 SCT040 BKN120 20/14 Q1012 NOSIG15:00 UTC / 00:00 local time: RKSI 061500Z 12002KT 8000 SCT040 BKN120 20/14 Q1012 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: ARAIB Report number: ARAIB/AAR1606 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years Download report:  Final report Sources: Yonhap  Korea Times   Location  Images: photo (c) ARAIB; Seoul-Incheon International Airport (ICN); June 2016 photo (c) ARAIB; Seoul-Incheon International Airport (ICN); June 2016 photo (c) ARAIB; Seoul-Incheon International Airport (ICN); June 2016 photo (c) ARAIB; Seoul-Incheon International Airport (ICN); June 2016 photo (c) ARAIB; Seoul-Incheon International Airport (ICN); 06 June 2016 photo (c) ARAIB; Seoul-Incheon International Airport (ICN); 06 June 2016 photo (c) Konstantin Von Wedelstaedt; Dubai Airport (DXB/OMDB); 24 October 2008 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Although some ice was present on the windshield, the deice/anti-ice equipment was operating as designed, and the windshield hot plate remained free of contamination. He stated that due to the overcast skies and snow covered ground, a flat light condition was present. The aircraft impacted an area of snow-covered tundra, at an elevation of about 2,500 feet msl. The top of the ridge where the airplane impacted is at an approximate elevation of 3,000 feet msl. From the initial point of impact, the airplane traveled about 300 feet before coming to rest in an upright position. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and wings.  Immediately following the accident, a passenger utilized a cellular phone to call for rescue from Anaktuvuk Pass residents. About 20 minutes after the call, the airplane was located and rescue personnel began extricating passengers and transporting them via snow machine to Anaktuvuk Pass for medical attention.

The pilot performed the landing checklist, which included extending the landing gear when the airplane was about 7 miles from the destination airport. Upon contacting the control tower, he was informed that the airplane was number two to land and was provided a vector for sequencing. After about 4 minutes, the pilot was instructed to turn toward the airport and cleared to land. The pilot stated that during his preparation for a no flap landing, he forgot that he had retracted and not subsequently lowered the landing gear. During the landing flare, the control tower stated ""gear"" and he attempted to abort the landing; however, the airplane contacted the runway and slid to a stop, about 2,500 feet beyond the beginning of the runway. A fuel bladder leak resulted in a fire in the area of the left engine nacelle and substantial damage to the left wing. The pilot stated that he did not hear a landing gear warning horn prior to the accident. According to the airplane flight manual, the landing gear warning would activate intermittently with the gear not down below a certain power setting.

Both pilots were killed. The aircraft departed Oslo-Gardermoen Airport, Norway at 23:10 hours local time on a mail and package flight to TromsÃ¸, Norway.  The take-off, departure and climb to cruising altitude, flight level 330, were performed according to normal procedures. The flight was uneventful until one minute and 20 seconds before the impact. The event started at 00:19:20 hrs, one hour and ten minutes into the flight in night time conditions of darkness without moonlight, clouds or turbulence. The lack of external visual references meant that the pilots were totally dependent on their instruments which consisted of three independent attitude indicators. Suddenly a very fast increase in pitch was displayed on the left attitude indicator. The pilot in command, who was the pilot flying and seated in the left seat exclaimed a strong expression. The displayed pitch change meant that the pilot in command was subjected to a surprise effect and a degradation of spatial orientation. The autopilot was, most probably, disconnected automatically, a ""cavalry charge"" aural warning and a single chime was heard, the latter most likely as a result of miscompare between the left and right pilots' flying displays (PFD). Both elevators moved towards nose down and nose down stabilizer trim was gradually activated from the left control wheel trim switch. The airplane started to descend, the angle of attack and G-loads became negative up to -1 G. Both pilots exclaimed strong expressions and the co-pilot said ""come up"". About 13 seconds after the start of the event the crew were presented with two contradictory attitude indicators with red chevrons pointing in opposite directions. At the same time none of the instruments displayed any comparator caution due to the PFDs declutter function in unusual attitude. Bank angle warnings were heard and the maximum operating speed and Mach number were exceeded 17 seconds after the start of the event, which activated the overspeed warning. The speed continued to increase, a distress call was transmitted and acknowledged by the air traffic control and the engine thrust was reduced to flight idle. The crew was active during the entire event. The dialogue between the pilots consisted mainly of different perceptions regarding turn directions. They also expressed the need to climb. At this stage, the pilots were probably subjected to spatial disorientation. The aircraft collided with the ground one minute and twenty seconds after the initial height loss. Investigation revealed that the erroneous attitude indication on PFD 1 was caused by a malfunction of the Inertial Reference Unit (IRU 1). The pitch and roll comparator indications of the PFDs were removed when the attitude indicators displayed unusual attitudes. In the simulator, in which the crew had trained, the corresponding indications were not removed. During the event the pilots initially became communicatively isolated from each other. Factors as to cause and contributing factors: The accident was caused by insufficient operational prerequisites for the management of a failure in a redundant system. Contributing factors were: - The absence of an effective system for communication in abnormal and emergency situations. - The flight instrument system provided insufficient guidance about malfunctions that occurred. - The initial manoeuver that resulted in negative G-loads probably affected the pilots' ability to manage the situation in a rational manner. Factors as to risk The fact that fault descriptions regarding aircraft and its components are reported in a less detailed manner might imply that the faults will not be identified and corrected in an efficient way. This can in turn lead to a flight safety issue as, for instance, intermittent faults cannot always be detected by general tests.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: SHK Report number: SRL 2016:01e Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) Source: Swedish Accident Investigation Authority photo (c) Source: Swedish Accident Investigation Authority; January 2016 photo (c) Source: Swedish Accident Investigation Authority; January 2016 photo (c) Giuseppe Battioli; Oslo-Gardermoen Airport (OSL/ENGM) [LN]; 23 August 2015 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Both occupants died in the accident. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed in the area, and an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan was filed for the personal cross-country flight from Salt Lake City International Airport, Utah, about 09:50, with an intended destination of Tucson International Airport, Arizona. The pilot contacted the SLC departure controller at 0951:59 and reported that he was climbing through 7,500 ft mean sea level (msl) for 10,000 ft. The controller then cleared the pilot to climb to and maintain Flight Level 230 (FL230), and to delete speed restrictions; the pilot confirmed the clearance. At 0952:21, the controller instructed the pilot to maintain 14,000 ft, to delete all speed restrictions, and asked him what speed he was climbing at; the pilot confirmed the clearance and stated that he was climbing at 200 knots (kts). At 0955:01, while approaching 14,000 ft the pilot reported that he had a failure with his Flight Management System (FMS), that he was ""switching to NAV for a second,"" and would be exceeding the assigned altitude. This was followed by an unintelligible transmission. At 0955:16, the controller instructed the pilot to descend and maintain 14,000 ft and to fly his present heading. About 10 seconds later, the pilot advised the controller that he had an autopilot failure, and requested a climb to visual meteorological conditions. The controller instructed the pilot to climb and maintain FL180. At 0955:47, the pilot responded by confirming the climb to FL180. The controller then asked the pilot if he needed assistance. The pilot did not immediately respond, and the controller asked him a second time. At 0956:16, the pilot responded ""negative,"" saying that he was ""just trying to get to clear skies,"" and was climbing to FL180. The pilot stated that his ""number 2"" was working, and that his ""altitude"" had failed. The pilot concluded the transmission by saying, ""...so, uh, my number two is working, climbing to one eight thousand."" At 0956:32, the controller advised the pilot that traffic would be crossing above him at FL190, and that it was important that he level the airplane at FL180; the pilot replied, ""We'll be watching."" At 0956:45, the controller advised the pilot of two areas of light precipitation directly ahead of the airplane, and asked the pilot if he would need vectors to clear the weather. At 0956:59, the pilot responded that he would appreciate any vectors possible. Shortly thereafter, at 0957:06, the controller asked the pilot to ""...paint a picture for me of where you think the clearest skies would be. I can vector you wherever you need to go."" At 0957:12, the pilot replied that he was heading to TUS, his altitude would not hold, and that he was hand flying the airplane. About this time, radar showed the airplane beginning a right turn from its previously-established southerly heading to a southwesterly heading, though the airplane had neither been cleared to do so by the controller nor had the pilot informed the controller of the deviation. About 0957:20, the pilot transmitted that he would appreciate any vectors possible. About 15 seconds later, the controller advised the pilot that he was showing him at 17,500 ft, directed the pilot to fly his present heading, and stated that the airplane would be clear of the precipitation in about 4 miles. About 17 seconds later, the pilot transmitted, ""...ok, MAYDAY. I do need to get up higher. I am losing different instruments. I'd really like to get clear of weather."" At 0958:01, the controller issued the pilot a clearance to climb and maintain FL230, which the pilot confirmed. About 0958:26, the controller amended the previous clearance and instructed the pilot to climb to and maintain FL310, which the pilot initially confirmed, but shortly thereafter stated, ""...yeah. I can't even dial that in. Still climbing, passing twenty thousand, so I'm just going to be reading it out to be sure my second is operating correctly."" At 0958:46, the controller stated that he was showing the airplane climbing through 20,200 ft, and asked the pilot if he wanted to continue to TUS; the pilot replied, ""That is affirmative."" At 0958:53, when the airplane was at 20,700 ft, the controller issued the pilot a no-gyro turn to the left for vectors to the southeast; this occurred about 1 minute 41 seconds after the airplane had turned southwest. Radar data showed that the pilot initiated a right turn from a southwesterly heading at an altitude of 20,700 ft. At 0959:12, the airplane reached an altitude of 21,300 ft. msl, and was still in the right turn. At 0959:13, the controller stated, ""November one bravo x-ray. I show you in a right turn. Can you turn left?"" At 0959:17, while climbing out of 21,300 ft, the pilot replied that he was ""trying to climb."" About 0959:47, the controller advised the pilot that he had lost the airplane's altitude readout, and asked the pilot the airplane's altitude. There were no further transmissions received from the pilot. Between 0959:49 and 0959:58, the airplane descended from an altitude of 21,300 ft to 16,000 ft, with its rate of descent during this time increasing from 9,600 ft per minute (fpm) to 36,000 fpm. The airplane's wreckage was located in open, flat pasture ground, about 1 nautical mile southwest of Cedar Fort, Utah, and about 28 nm south-southwest of SLC. A survey of the accident site revealed that the linear debris path of wreckage extended for about 1 nm on a west to east orientation. Probable Cause: ""The pilot's loss of control due to spatial disorientation while operating in instrument meteorological conditions, which resulted in an exceedance of the airplane's design stress limitations, and a subsequent in-flight breakup. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's reported inflight instrumentation anomaly, the origin of which could not be determined during the investigation.""METAR: 09:53 UTC / 16:53 local time: KSLC 181653Z 13004KT 10SM -RA FEW030 BKN046 OVC060 03/01 A3009 RMK AO2 RAE01B51 SLP191 P0000 T0033000610:53 UTC / 17:53 local time: KSLC 181753Z 17005KT 10SM FEW030 BKN044 OVC065 04/01 A3008 RMK AO2 RAE44 SLP186 P0000 60006 T00440011 10044 20022 50002Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: WPR16FA054 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  FOX 13  LiveATC   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; 1,9 km SW of Cedar Fort, UT; 18 January 2016; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; 1,9 km SW of Cedar Fort, UT; 18 January 2016; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; 1,9 km SW of Cedar Fort, UT; 18 January 2016; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; 1,9 km SW of Cedar Fort, UT; 18 January 2016; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; 1,9 km SW of Cedar Fort, UT; 18 January 2016; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; 1,9 km SW of Cedar Fort, UT; 18 January 2016; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; 1,9 km SW of Cedar Fort, UT; 18 January 2016; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; 1,9 km SW of Cedar Fort, UT; 18 January 2016; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were no injuries to the 153 passengers and crew members onboard the MD-88 or to the one person aboard the B767 nor to the four ground crew personnel.  There was substantial damage to the horizontal stabilizer and elevator of the MD-88. According to the operator, after landing the MD-88 crew taxied into the alley in the vicinity of gate 36, awaiting gate 41B to clear, and set the parking brake.   Airport Customer Service (ACS) representatives were towing the B767 to gate 42 (the ACS personnel were not aboard with the intent for flight), and following a Port Authority vehicle to gate 42.  The ACS agents and the MD-88 flight crew reported that the ramp conditions were very slushy and limited space was available.  The ACS representative aboard the B767 requested that the MD-88 pull forward, to allow clearance between the two aircraft, and the flight crew complied with the request.  The captain stated that he could only move about 15 to 20 feet due to the ramp conditions. Shortly afterward, the flight crew felt the impact and noted that the two aircraft had made contact.  The tug driver was not aware of the impact until after arrival at gate 42.  The MD-88 was towed to the gate and passengers deplaned via the jetway.  The MD-88 received substantial damage to the left elevator, elevator tab, and horizontal stabilizer tip. The left winglet of the B767 received minor damage. Probable Cause: the ground crew's misjudgment of the distance between the B767 wingtip and the MD-88 tail.

Of the 148 passengers and crew members onboard, one flight attendant was seriously injured and the airplane was not damaged. The airplane was operating under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121as a regularly scheduled passenger flight from T. F. Green Airport (PVD), Providence, Rhode Island. According to the operator, the flights routing passed east of Jacksonville, Florida over the Atlantic to the east of the Florida peninsula.  A frontal system and jet stream stretched to the west and northwest of the flight's routing with turbulence forecast and reported on the western portions of the peninsula.  The flight crew reported that they were in cruise at FL380 in smooth air but were aware of potential turbulence throughout the flight.  Upon initial descent, the captain illuminated the fasten seat belt sign and advised the passengers to remain seated.  While descending through approximately FL320, the airplane encountered turbulence in clear air lasting approximately 3 seconds. At the time of the turbulence encounter, two flight attendants (FA) were securing the aft galley for landing when one fell to the floor injuring her ankle.  Medically trained passengers assisted the injured FA who could not complete her duties.  The flight crew advised the FLL station of the event and requested medical assistance upon landing.  The airplane landed at FLL with no further incident.  The flight attendant was transported to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a broken ankle.

The pilot was conducting his third flight of the day when the aircraft departed Hamilton Island Airport at about 14:15 local time with 10 passengers on board. The tour included a scenic flight over the Great Barrier Reef for about 50 minutes before heading to Chance Bay, on the south-east tip of Whitsunday Island, about 11 km north east of Hamilton Island Airport. Following a water landing at Chance Bay, the group was to spend 90 minutes at the beach before a short flight back to Hamilton Island. The tour was originally planned to include a landing at Whitehaven Beach, however wind conditions at the time required the water landing be altered to Chance Bay. The aircraft approach Whitsunday Island from the north and conduct an orbit about 2 km north of Whitehaven Beach at about 15:10, before heading toward Whitehaven Beach. It flew over the southern end of Whitehaven Beach and the strip of land that separates it from Chance Bay. The pilot advised that he flew over the western end of Chance BayÂs main beach in order to conduct a visual pre-landing check of the bay. The pilot noted the positions of various vessels moored in the bay to determine the best taxi path to the beach. During this fly-over, the pilot also noted the sea state and observed evidence of wind gusts on the water surface. The pilot then initiated a right downwind turn toward the landing area. The approach was from the south with the intent to land in the most suitable location within the designated landing area and then taxi to the beach. The pilot reported setting up for landing at about 50 ft above the water and then delayed the landing in order to fly through an observed wind gust. Passenger video footage indicated that, during the subsequent landing, WTY bounced three times on the surface of the water. After the second bounce, with WTY getting closer to the beach and terrain, the pilot increased engine power and initiated a go-around. The third bounce, which occurred almost immediately after the second, was the most pronounced and resulted in the aircraft rebounding about 30 to 50 ft above the water. While increasing power, the pilot perceived that the torque was indicating red, suggesting an over-torque for the selected propeller configuration. Noticing that the climb performance was less than expected with the flaps at 30Â°, the pilot stopped increasing power and reduced the flap to 20Â°. As the aircraft climbed straight ahead towards a saddle, climb performance was still below the pilotÂs expectations and he assessed that WTY would not clear the terrain. In response, the pilot turned right to avoid the surrounding rising terrain. The aircraft clipped trees during this turn, before colliding with terrain and coming to rest in dense scrub about 150 m from the eastern end of the main beach, near the top of the ridge. The pilot promptly advised the passengers to exit and move away from the aircraft. Some of the 11 people on board suffered minor injuries but all were able to quickly leave the aircraft. There was no post-impact fire. Contributing factors - The aircraft's initial touches with water were past the nominated decision point and beyond the northern boundary of the ALA, which reduced the safety margins available for a successful water landing or go-around. - The pilot initiated a go-around without using all available power and the optimal speed, turned towards higher terrain and placed the aircraft in a down-wind situation, which ultimately resulted in the collision with terrain. Other findings - The aircraft was equipped with lap-sash seatbelts, which have been demonstrated to reduce injury, and the use of emergency beacons and satellite phone facilitated a timely response to the accident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ATSB Report number: AO-2016-007 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 years and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Daily Mercury  7News Brisbane  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The explosion occurred on the right hand side of the aircraft, just behind the R2 door, at seat 16F. A large hole was blown in the fuselage and one passenger fell out of the aircraft and was killed. Three other passengers were injured.  The aircraft returned to Mogadishu where it landed safely at 08:53 UTC (11:53 hours local time). An investigation revealed that the 55-year old passenger that was killed, was booked on Turkish Airlines flight TK689, which routes to Djibouti and Istanbul, Turkey.  On February 1 and 2 Turkish Airlines cancelled the return leg between Djibouti to Mogadishu and passengers had to take D3 159, which departed 65 minutes after the scheduled departure time of TK689. Somali intelligence officials say two airport workers handled the laptop believed to have contained the bomb. They handed over the laptop to the passenger that was killed. In May 2016 a military court in Somalia sentence ten people involved in the bombing. Causes The accident was caused by the explosion of a laptop bomb device carried by a passenger on board.Accident investigation:   Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: Goobjoog News  Horseed Media  Daallo Airlines statement  Somaliland Monitor  BEA History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  29 March 2013 SX-BHS Air MÃ©diterranÃ©e, lsf Hermes Airlines 0 Lyon Saint-ExupÃ©ry Airport (LYS) min Location  Images: photo (c) Aviation Safety Network; Mogadishu International Airport (MGQ) photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Rhodes/Paradisi-Diagoras Airport (RHO/LGRP); August 2013 photo (c) Miklos SZABO; Singapore-Changi International Airport (SIN/WSSS); 05 December 2010 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates29-Jul-2024 05:53 ASN Updated [Narrative, Accident report, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

LESSONS AND CONCLUSIONS The captain had checked the operation of the brakes during the procedure before start up but had not engaged the parking brake. Pressed by the falling rain, thinking that the parking brake was engaged, the first officer signalled the ramp agent to remove the chocks. In fact, after asking the captain if the brakes were ""OK"", the first officer assumed they were referring to the ""parking brake"" but he did not explain that clearly. The outward vision of the commander was changed by rainwater running down the windshield, which did not allow him to detect the plane's rolling. Despite intervention by the first officer on the movement of the aircraft, the captain did not have time to slow down. Since then, the aerodrome operator has modified the procedures for ramp agents on this parking area. They are now required to place the wedges on the front until the departure of the aircraft. Furthermore, a NOTAM was published and attracted the attention of crews on the peculiarity of this parking area. An amendment to the aerodrome VAC (AIP) chart must be issued.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Report number: BEA2016-0077 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Of the 100 passengers and crew onboard, one passenger received serious injuries.Â  The airplane was not damaged. The regularly scheduled passenger flight was operating under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 from Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (PHX), Phoenix, Arizona, to MSP. The flight crew stated that at FL350, prior to their planned top-of-descent, Minneapolis Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) informed them to expect light turbulence during the descent through about FL280. The captain made a public address announcement to the passengers and cabin crew to expect light turbulence so to fasten their seatbelts. The seatbelt sign was on at that time, and had been on most of the flight due to light turbulence.Â  As the flight was descending through about FL310, the nose of the airplane dipped down and the airspeed increased, and to avoid an overspeed the pilot flying pitched the nose up and deployed the speed brakes. Subsequently, they received a call from the flight attendants that a passenger had been injured after having stood up ""to stretch"" just before the turbulence.Â  After arriving at the gate, the passenger was transported to the hospital and diagnosed with a broken leg.

According to the deice ground crew, N784SW and a United airplane on deice pad 4 were not fully pulled into their respective parking spots on the deice pad. N925NN passed behind N784SW and turned to enter to an adjacent deice pad, and its right winglet contacted the right elevator, horizontal stabilizer, and APU of the Southwest B737. Probable Cause: N925NN flight crew's incorrect evaluation of the clearance between the two aircraft, leading to the inadvertent collision of the winglet with the horizontal stabilizer and elevator of N784SWAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA16CA094B Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft was pushed back from stand 15 at 14:34 JST. Subsequently engines no.2 and 1 were started and the aircraft began taxing. However heavy snowfall forced the plane back to a gate. While moving towards stand 20, about 15:06,  smoke entered the cabin and a tailpipe fire occurred on engine no.2. The aircraft was evacuated. One passenger was seriously injured (broken thoracic vertebrae) and two passengers were slightly injured during the evacuation. It appears that extreme snowfall caused ice on the fan blades and in the LPC (Low Pressure Chamber) of both engines, obstructing the air flow. Oil from the bearing sump was discharged, entering the cabin recirculation system and engine no. 2 tail pipe. This caused a mist in the aircraft cabin and ignition of oil in the hot tail pipe, causing flames.

All 23 on board suffered fatal injuries. The aircraft departed at 07:50 hours local time from Pokhara Airport (PKR) on a domestic 20-minute flight to Jomsom Airport (JMO), Nepal. The copilot acted as Pilot Flying, the captain as Pilot Monitoring during the flight. En route the flight deviated to the left and climbed to 12000 feet to avoid clouds.  Over the Ghorepani area the GPWS began to sound. The aircraft was flying through clouds with a little visibility in between and a descent to 10000 feet was initiated. At 10200 feet the GPWS sounded again but the captain responded not to worry about it. The captain was used to hearing these warnings in normal flight, so it became a habit to disregard the warnings. About one minute before the accident the captain took over control and initiated a climb. The aircraft impacted a mountainside at 10700 feet, coming to rest at an elevation of 10982 feet. According to a statement by the airline, the aircraft crashed near Tirkhe Dungha, Dana VDC of Myagdi district. Probable Cause: The Commission concludes that the probable cause of this accident was the fact that despite of unfavourable weather conditions, the crew's repeated decision to enter into cloud during VFR flight and their deviation from the normal track due to loss of situational awareness aggravated by spatial disorientation leading to CFIT accident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Nepal AAIC Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Hemant Arjyal  The Himalayan Times  Tara Air   Location  Images: photo (c) Google / annotations by ASN; Dana, Myagdi district; 24 February 2016 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft landed safely on runway 27 and was about to vacate the runway via taxiway N9 when the right main landing gear collapsed. There were no injuries to any person onboard the aircraft. The aircraft sustained substantial damage. The landing was carried out by co-pilot and captain was carrying out Supervised Line Flying (SLF). During landing flare, aircraft floated a little and the touchdown was normal. The aircraft landed with a  vertical acceleration of 1.44 G. About 16 seconds after touch down, at a speed of around 58 kts, there was right roll of 4.57Â° and the aircraft started veering to the right with a noise which felt like a tire burst to the cockpit crew. To maintain directional control first officer moved the tiller. The aircraft vacated via taxiway N9 and stopped on the taxiway with the tail of the aircraft not fully clear of runway 27. Taxiway N9 is about 2600 meters/8550 feet down the runway 27. Flaps were moved to 40, in case if the situation warranted an evacuation. Thereafter, the captain contacted the Jet Airways dispatcher. Also, the APU was started and engine no.2 was shut down, followed by engine no.1.  Meanwhile the airport fire service attended as the ATC controller had observed sparks from the right side of the aircraft after landing. On arrival of passenger stairs, the occupants were safely disembarked through the L1 door and no emergency evacuation was carried out. An investigation revealed that a main landing gear aft trunnion pin had failed as a result of improper grinding during overhaul. Several trunnion pins were overhauled by the same company. The first failure occurred on April 13, 2015 to a Jet Airways Boeing 737-800. During landing rollout at Khajuraho Airport, the left hand main gear aft trunnion pin failed.  According to maintenance records two sets of trunnion pins had been overhauled. As a precautionary measure, on 20 August 2015, the aft trunnion pins of VT-JGC were removed from the aircraft. After the accident involving VT-JGD, it appeared from maintenance records that in fact three sets of trunnion pins (including VT-JGD) had been overhauled by the same company. PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT: The Committee of inquiry determined the cause of accident as ""The RH Aft landing Gear trunnion pin failed due to base metal heat damage as a result of abusive grinding of the chrome plate that likely occurred during the last overhaul"".METAR: 16:00 UTC / 21:30 local time: VABB 031600Z 23007KT 3000 FU FEW100 32/15 Q1013 NOSIG16:30 UTC / 22:00 local time: VABB 031630Z 02003KT 3000 FU FEW100 32/15 Q1013 NOSIG17:00 UTC / 22:30 local time: VABB 031700Z 30006KT 3000 FU NSC 31/15 Q1014 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB India Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Boeing 737-800 VT-JGA 13 April 2015 accident, same cause   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Neither of the 2 flight crew were injured. The flight originated from the Louisville International Airport (SDF), Kentucky. The airplane sustained damage to a 23 foot long section of lower fuselage skin, 4 fuselage stringers, 5 fuselage frames, 3 floor stringers and the tail skid. The replacement of the frames and stringers was considered a major repair. According to the operator, the captain was the pilot flying, and the first officer the pilot monitoring for the flight from SDF-ABQ. Ground operations were normal in SDF and no aircraft loading or Weight and Balance discrepancies were noted. The climb, cruise, and descent portion of the flight were uneventful. Weather conditions at ABQ prior to arrival were reported as visual conditions, with wind from 090 at 20 knots gusting to 29 knots. The target approach speed used was 146 knots. The crew was vectored to the ILS approach to runway 03 and joined the localizer and glideslope using the autopilot. The autopilot was then disengaged at 1103 feet Height Above Touchdown (HAT) and at 1000 feet HAT the approach met all UPS Stabilized Approach criteria with the aircraft fully configured at flaps 30, gear down, and speed 145 knots. At 500 feet HAT the approach continued to meet all stabilized approach criteria with speed 146 knots. Flight data indicated that the crosswind component at this point was 23 knots from the right. At 158 feet above touchdown the approach met all stabilized approach criteria and the captain disconnected the autothrottles. UPS guidance recommends use of the autothrottle until 50 feet above touchdown. From this point on the approach until touchdown, the aircraft pitch attitude began to increase as the airspeed slowly decreased. Flight Data indicates that the thrust levers were at a reduced thrust setting when the autothrottles were disconnected and remained at that setting until touchdown. At 1.75 seconds from touchdown the airspeed had decayed to 129 knots and the aircraft pitch had increased to 7.2 degrees. The crosswind had also decreased and was now 13 knots from the right. At touchdown the airspeed was 128 knots and pitch attitude 8.4 degrees. The tailskid impacted the runway at touchdown followed immediately by the lower aft fuselage as the pitch attitude increased momentarily to 8.6 degrees. Initial tailskid impact occurred at approximately 800 feet from the runway threshold. The crew reported that they encountered a 10 knot wind loss just prior to touchdown and landed firmer than normal, but didn't suspect that they had struck the tailskid. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The pilot flying's failure to maintain airspeed and correct pitch attitude. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's failure to maintain appropriate thrust after disconnecting the autothrottles. Also contributing was the first officer's failure to monitor the decaying airspeed and increasing pitch.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA16CA113 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  7 February 2019 N305UP UPS 0 175 nm NE of Goose Bacy, Canada non Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Albuquerque Sunport Airport, NM (ABQ/KABQ); March 2016; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Three Ukrainian crew members died in the crash and another was critically injured.  The aircraft operated a scheduled cargo flight from Cox's Bazar to Jessore in Bangladesh. The on board cargo consisted of 802 boxes of shrimp weighing 4800 kg. The flight crew requested startup clearance at 02:58 UTC. The aircraft was then cleared to taxi to runway 35 via taxiway S.  Takeoff clearance was given 03:05 UTC.  During takeoff a drop in oil pressure in the torque meter system of engine no.1 caused the engine to lose power the cruise mode. The captain decided to continue takeoff. Immediately after becoming airborne the pilot reported an engine failure and requested for immediate return back to Cox's Bazar Airport. He was advised by ATC to report left hand down wind.  Within 60 seconds after takeoff the no. 1 lost power completely. The captain initially tried to maneuver the aircraft to land on runway 17 (departure runway, opposite direction), but was unable to line up with the runway. The crew decided to continue on a right hand downwind at around 1000 feet with a IAS of 300km/h in clean configuration. The aircraft turned to final and fully configured for landing and stable at around 3.5 NM from the runway. But at 1.2 NM for reasons unknown the captain decided to go around and climbed to 400-500 feet.  ATC advised the captain to report left hand down wind. But there was no response from the crew. The aircraft had impacted the shallow waters on the coast, 3 km West of the airport. Causes: a) Failure to initiate a rejected take off during take off roll following the indication of engine failure; b) Failure to adhere to the company SOP following the detection of the engine failure during take off; c) Considering the poor visibility at Cox's Bazar Airport, diverting to the alternate airfield Chittagong Airport located only 50 nm away that has the provision for full ILS approach facility. This could have helped the crew in carrying out a proper one engine out precision approach landing; d) The aircraft flew at a speed much lower than the clean configuration speed. The aircraft flew at 225 km/h in clean configuration whereas the minimum clean configuration speed is 290 km/hr. e) As per the FDR data the aircraft stalled while making a turn towards the side of the failed engine at a very low altitude;Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIG-BD Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) Hunter_UA; Kirovograd Airport (KGO/UKKG); 08 October 2015 photo (c) Hunter_UA; Kirovograd Airport (KGO/UKKG); 16 October 2014 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

According to flight crew statements, the captain was the flying pilot and the first officer (FO) was the pilot monitoring.Â  The airplane was level at flight level (FL) 270, with the autopilot off, in clear air with noÂ convective activity in the vicinity.Â  Immediately before before beginning the descent into IAH, the flight encountered a momentary pocket of moderate to severe turbulence with the airplane banking approximately 25 Ã¢ÂÂ 30 degrees to the right, and the altitude fluctuating from 100 feet up to 60 - 160 feet down. Â The flight crew did not recall seeing anything on the onboard weather radar or TCAS (traffic collision avoidance system).Â  The captain immediately turned on the seat belt signÂ and made an announcement on the public address for the passengers to fasten their seat belts. Shortly after, the flight crew were informed that a flight attendant FA was injured. The captain called the cabin and was informed thatÂ one of the FAs was severely injured.Â  The flight crew declared a medical emergency and arranged for paramedics to meet the flight at the gate.Â  The FA was transported to a local hospital and diagnosed with serious injuries. According to a weather analysis conducted by United Airlines, satellite imagery indicated no significant cloud features over the route of flight, with the moisture channel imagery indicating moisture channel darkening or drier air in the middle tropospheric levels across the northern half of Texas and southern Los Angeles with increasing moisture further to the south with the stronger jet stream winds.Â Â A review ofÂ pilot reportsÂ (PIREPs) across the region leading up to the turbulence only indicated light turbulence being encountered.Â Â Consequently, The Weather Company forecasts only called for light turbulence for the route.Â Â However, several Aircraft Meteorological Data and Reporting (AMDAR) automated reports across the region indicated that winds were stronger than predicted at higher levels and indicated a strong vertical wind shear at higher levels than originally forecast. Probable Cause: an inadvertent encounter with clear air turbulence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA16CA181 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA16CA181 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  17 February 2014 N23708 United Airlines 0 Kaycee, Wyoming non Turbulence Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates02-Jun-2023 13:51 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

Russell Regional Airport (RMG), Georgia. The pilot was uninjured and the co-pilot received minor injuries.  According to the crew, the automated surface observing system at the airport indicated the winds were variable at 6 knots. They requested and were cleared for the visual approach to runway 7, which was 4,495 feet-long. While in the traffic pattern and abeam the runway numbers, the crew lowered the landing gear and deployed 20 degrees of flaps, followed by 30 degrees on the base leg. On final approach, the crew stated that the turbulence was moderate and the airspeed started fluctuate and decreased to Vref. They responded by adjusting engine power on short final, and noted that ""considerable power"" was necessary to maintain airspeed. The airplane touched down at the Vref speed of 112 kts inside the touchdown zone, but the ground speed appeared to be fast. The crew activated the speed brakes, and the pilot applied the wheel brakes (the airplane was not equipped with thrust reversers). The crew then increased their braking to maximum, and when it was evident that the airplane not going to stop before the end of the runway, they activated the emergency brake. The airplane departed the end of the runway and travelled into the safety area, where it sank into the grass and mud as it continued forward in a slight left turn. The nose landing gear collapsed and the forward fuselage struck the ground resulting in substantial damage to the airframe. The airplane came to rest approximately 350 feet from the departure end of the runway. One of the flight crew members of the aircraft stated to ASN that NO tailwind was involved, contrary to what ASN previously reported based on a statement from an airport spokesman in local media. Instead, N465FL had three previous documented brake failures in the months preceding this accident.METAR: 17:53 UTC / 13:53 local time: METAR KRMG 141753Z AUTO 21012G17KT 10SM FEW044 SCT055 BKN095 22/14 A2977 RMK AO2 SLP074 T02220139 10233 20111 5802018:53 UTC / 14:53 local time: METAR KRMG 141853Z AUTO VRB04KT 10SM SCT043 SCT055 BKN100 24/13 A2975 RMK AO2 SLP067 T0239013319:53 UTC / 15:53 local time: METAR KRMG 141953Z AUTO 23013G21KT 190V260 10SM BKN050 BKN090 OVC110 23/13 A2974 RMK AO2 PK WND 21026/1904 SLP063 T02280128 Sources: NTSB   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The mishap flight was a chartered flight to transport personnel of Pakistan Petroleum Limited from Karachi to Sui. The takeoff weight was within limits. The calculated V1 and V2 speeds were 104 Kts and 106 Kts respectively, whereas the stalling speed was 84 Kts. The captain was Pilot Flying (PF) and the first officer was Pilot Monitoring (PM) for this sector. However, the first officer was a qualified captain on Beechcraft 1900D aircraft. The aircraft taxied out at 08:05 hours local time. The aircraft start up and taxiing was normal. The flight was given runway 25L for takeoff and the aircraft lined up on the runway. After obtaining takeoff clearance, the flight crew completed pre take off checks with no abnormalities observed. At 08:23:06, take off thrust was applied very gradually and the aircraft started to roll. Five seconds after reaching maximum power, at 08:23:35 the PM announced the speed being 80 kts. FDR data indicated an increasing trend in torque and drop in propeller rpm of engine no. 2, which was not monitored by the flight crew. The propeller rpm dropped to a minimum 709 rpm in the next 11 seconds. Also, torque of engine no.1 began to drop, without any significant change in rpm. The aircraft was still rolling for takeoff and accellerating through 95 kts. When the no. 2 engine propeller rpm started to drop, the PF announced that the aircraft began drifting towards the right. The PM replied ""continue...continue"". At 08:23:44 when the aircraft was reaching 96 kts, the PM asked PF to turn left and apply left rudder.  The flight crew did not realize at this stage that there was a problem with both engines and they were still below V1 which, as per pre flight calculation, was 104 kts.  At 08:23:49 the first officer asked the captain to increase the power of the left engine. By this time the drop in no. 1 engine torque had been arrested. It appears that the first officer had a glance on torque indicator and asked the captain to increase power.  At 08:23:53 the captain glanced at the engine instruments and wanted to express his concern about loss of power. Before being able the first officer announced ÂV1...rotateÂ at 08:23:55 and 101 kts of speed. After getting airborne, the aircraft continued to drift towards the right. In order to control the dropping speed and direction loss, the first officer took over the controls. At 08:24:08 when decreasing speed had reached 98 kts the first officer asked the captain to raise the landing gears in order to reduce drag and gain speed. The aircraft had climbed to approximately 39 feet above ground and the captain asked the first officer to lower the nose in order to gain speed. At 08:24:19 when the aircraft was at 101 kts and approximately 41 feet above ground level, the first officer asked the captain to raise the flaps. While the aircraft was losing altitude, the maximum speed of 105 kts was recorded and aircraft was passing through 10 feet above ground level. Also, at this time the first officer asked the captain to reduce left engine power. The first officer judged that there was no option other than to make the aircraft land on the remaining runway. The aircraft hit the runway surface with landing gear retracted, approximately 9000 ft from the beginning of runway 25L. The aircraft continued to drag on the runway while continuously drifting right for 800 ft before departing towards right side on the fair weather strip. After travelling approximately 600 ft on the fair weather strip, the aircraft veered towards the left and came to a final stop on the runway 1050 ft short from end of runway. As the captain was seriously injured, the first officer brought fuel control levers, propeller levers and power levers back; put the battery and generators off after the aircraft came to halt. An immediate evacuation of the passengers was carried out. Cause of Occurrence The investigation therefore, concludes that: 1. Some internal malfunction of the Propeller Governor Part No. 8210-410 Serial No. 2490719 was the cause of experienced uncommanded auto feather. However, exact cause of the occurrence could not be determined. 2. Continuing take off below V1 speed (104kts) after encountering engine malfunction and after takeoff raising flaps below recommended height (400ft AGL) lead to decrease in lift and unsustainability of flight.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: PakCAA Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane was destroyed and the 55 passengers and 7 crew fatally injured. Flight 981 departed Dubai at 18:37 hours UTC on March 18. The en route part of the flight was normal. The flight arrived near Rostov and the crew performed a manual approach to runway 22 with the autopilot disconnected. Weather conditions were poor with a cloud base at 630 meters, wind 230 degrees at 13 meters per second, maximum 18 meters per second, light rain shower, mist, severe turbulence and moderate windshear. At 22:42 UTC (01:42 local time) in the course of the initial approach at a height of 340 meters (1115 feet), the flight received a windshear alert. The flight crew decided to go around and then continued to a holding pattern waiting for improved weather conditions. The flight left the holding pattern at 00:28 UTC (03:28 LT) and descended towards Rostov for another approach to runway 22.  As the crew were proceeding with another manual approach, they decided to go around again at a height of 220 meters (721 feet), 4,5 km before the runway after receiving another windshear alert. They initiated a climb with a vertical speed of up to 20 m/s and setting the engines to maximum takeoff/go-around (TOGA) thrust. In the course of the go-around the crew set flaps to 15Â° and retracted the landing gear. At the height of 1900 ft (approx. 600 m) after reaching the pitch angle of 18Â° the pilot flying pushed on the control column, which led to a decrease in vertical acceleration of up to 0.5, increase in forward speed and, consequently, automatic retraction of flaps from 15Â° to 10Â° at a speed of over 200 knots. The short-term decrease in engine thrust within 3 seconds resulted in decreasing speed and flaps extension to 15Â°, although the following crew inputs to regain maximum takeoff/go-around thrust led to speed increase and reiterated automatic flaps retraction to 10Â°. The flaps remained in the latter configuration until the impact. The pilot flying, by pulling up the control column, continued climbing with a vertical speed of as much as 16 m/s. At a height of 900 m there was a simultaneous control column nose down input and stabilizer nose down deflection from -2,5 deg (6,5 units) to +2,5 deg (1,5 units). The FDR recorded a nose down stabilizer input from the stabilizer trim switch of the control wheel lasting 12 seconds, while the CVR record contains a specific noise of rotation of the trim wheels located on both sides of the central pedestal. As a result the aircraft, having climbed to about 1000 m, turned into descent with a negative vertical acceleration of -1g. The following crew recovery actions did not allow to avoid an impact with the ground. The aircraft hit the runway about 120 m from the threshold with a speed of over 600 km/h and over 50 degrees nose down pitch.

The fatal air accident to the Boeing 737-8KN A6-FDN aircraft occurred during the second go around, due to an incorrect aircraft configuration and crew piloting, the subsequent loss of PICÂs situational awareness in nighttime in IMC. This resulted in a loss of control of the aircraft and its impact with the ground. The accident is classified as Loss of Control In-Flight (LOC-I) occurrence. Most probably, the contributing factors to the accident were: - the presence of turbulence and gusty wind with the parameters, classified as a moderate to-strong ""windshear"" that resulted in the need to perform two go-arounds; - the lack of psychological readiness (not go-around minded) of the PIC to perform the second go-around as he had the dominant mindset on the landing performance exactly at the destination aerodrome, having formed out of the ""emotional distress"" after the first unsuccessful approach (despite the RWY had been in sight and the aircraft stabilized on the glide path, the PIC had been forced to initiate go-around due to the windshear warning activation), concern on the potential exceedance of the duty time to perform the return flight and the recommendation of the airline on the priority of landing at the destination aerodrome; - the loss of the PICÂs leadership in the crew after the initiation of go-around and his ""confusion"" that led to the impossibility of the on-time transition of the flight mental mode from ""approach with landing"" into ""go-around""; - the absence of the instructions of the maneuver type specification at the go-around callout in the aircraft manufacturer documentation and the airline OM; - the crewÂs uncoordinated actions during the second go-around: on the low weight aircraft the crew was performing the standard go-around procedure (with the retraction of landing gear and flaps), but with the maximum available thrust, consistent with the Windshear Escape Maneuver procedure that led to the generation of the substantial excessive nose-up moment and significant (up to 50 lb/23 kg) ""pushing"" forces on the control column to counteract it; - the failure of the PIC within a long time to create the pitch, required to perform go around and maintain the required climb profile while piloting aircraft unbalanced in forces; - the PICÂs insufficient knowledge and skills on the stabilizer manual trim operation, which led to the long-time (for 12 sec) continuous stabilizer nose-down trim with the subsequent substantial imbalance of the aircraft and its upset encounter with the generation of the negative G, which the crew had not been prepared to. The potential impact of the somatogravic ""pitch-up illusion"" on the PIC might have contributed to the long keeping the stabilizer trim switches pressed; - the psychological incapacitation of the PIC that resulted in his total spatial disorientation, did not allow him to respond to the correct prompts of the F/O; - the absence of the criteria of the psychological incapacitation in the airline OM, which prevented the F/O from the in-time recognition of the situation and undertaking more decisive actions; - the possible operational tiredness of the crew: by the time of the accident the crew had been proceeding the flight for 6 hours, of which 2 hours under intense workload that implied the need to make non-standard decisions; in this context the fatal accident occurred at the worst possible time in terms of the circadian rhythms, when the human performance is severely degraded and is at its lower level along with the increase of the risk of errors. The lack of the objective information on the HUD operation (there were no flight tests of the unit carried out into the entire range of the operational G, including the negative ones; the impossibility to reproduce the real HUD readings in the progress of the accident flight, that is the image the pilot was watching with the consideration of his posture in the seat trough the stream video or at the FFS) did not allow making conclusion on its possible impact on the flight outcome.

The aircraft, approached runway 25 for landing at the Rio Grande Airport in good visibility. Wind was 260 degrees at 19 knots. A normal landing was carried out in the first third of the runway. Deceleration started normally but at some point the aircraft maintained its speed.  The pilot proceeded to apply maximum reverse and maximum brakes and the airplane decelerated until a speed of approximately 20-30 kts. It traveled the last 600-800 meters of runway without increasing or reducing speed. Subsequently the pilot-in-command decided to steer the plane off the runway to avoid collision with the ILS system and stopped both engines. The aircraft collided with a mound of earth, causing structural damages. Conclusions of the analysis On a general aviation flight, during landing at the International Airport Governor Ramon Trejo, there was runway excursion 25 on the right side of the runway. The aircraft was stopped by impact against a mound, causing the recorded damage. The reasons for the runway excursion could not be established with certainty due to the lack of solid evidence. However, we were able to identify two factors of relevance to operational safety: - The divergence from the regulations referring to runway margins, which caused the damage to the aircraft. While this deficiency was not related to causality with the accident, influenced the severity of it. - The absence of a brake system failure procedure.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JIAAC Report number: 91845/16 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources: JIAAC   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Numerous attempts were made to lower the gear as per emergency checklist. The decision was then made by the flight crew to land the aircraft in the configuration that it was jammed in. The aircraft slid down runway 14 coming to rest on the center line near intersection Bravo. The nearby awaiting fire trucks foamed the aircraft and its underbelly to prevent any post-crash fire. Conclusion The Air Accident Investigation Department has determined the probable cause of this accident to be system component failure or malfunction within the nose landing gear operating system.

Dark, night time conditions existed at the time of the accident. The ATR-42-600, operated by TransNusa Aviation Mandiri and registered PK-TNJ, was parked at stand B-1 on the north apron of Halim Airport and was to be moved from the north to the south apron. For this the aircraft had to cross the active runway. A towing car was used with a driver and one supporting personnel. Two engineers occupied the pilot seats in the aircraft. The engineers were assigned to apply aircraft brakes if required during the towing process. The towed aircraft was towed without aircraft electrical power fed to the system and the navigation light, strobe light and the aircraft radio communications were off. The communication between the towing car driver and Halim Tower was performed by a handheld radio communication on frequency 152.7 MHz. At 19:45 local time flight ID7703 requested pushback clearance to the Halim Tower controller on frequency 118.6 MHz. The aircraft was parked on parking stand B-2 and was approved to push back.  After the ID7703 completed the pushback, the towing car driver of the towed aircraft requested clearance to Halim Tower Control Unit to reposition from parking stand B-1 to the south apron. The towing car driver was instructed to follow ID7703 and to report when on taxiway C. The communication between the towing car driver and Halim Tower was handled by the assistant controller. The controller heard the communication between the assistant and towing car driver, he recognized the position of the towed aircraft was on the parking stand B-1.  The ID7703 flight crew did not know that there was a towing aircraft behind as communications with the car were on a different frequency. At 19:48, ID7703 received taxi clearance to runway 24 via taxiway C. At 19:50, the controller instructed ID7703 to hold on taxiway C due to an arriving aircraft. The assistant stated that when ID7703 was holding on short taxiway C, the towing car began moving the ATR-42. At 19:53, ID7703 received clearance from controller to enter runway 24 to back track for departure. The aircraft that had just arrived would use parking stand B-1. Therefore, the assistant controller instructed the towing car driver to expedite the tow and report when on taxiway C. The controller was not observing the ATR at that time. The towing car was about to enter taxiway C at that time. At 19:56, ID7703 reported ready for takeoff. The controller did not see any vehicle or object on the runway then issued clearance for takeoff. The pilot stated that during line up, the lights surrounding the turn pad were very bright and affected his forward vision for a short time. It was common practice in Halim to lineup at the turn pad beyond the threshold runway 24. After receiving the takeoff clearance, the Second in Command (SIC) as pilot flying (PF) opened the power and pressed the Take Off / Go Around (TOGA) button. The towing car driver stated that, when he saw ID7703 was lining up for takeoff, he asked Halim Tower whether ID7703 was initiating the takeoff. There was no reply from Halim Tower. The towing car driver then sped up the towing and turned to the right side of the runway. When ID7703 was accelerating through approximate 80 knots, the SIC saw an object warned the captain. The pilots could not identify the object but later on when the object became closer, the SIC realized that there was an aircraft. The captain took over control and applied the right rudder towards the right side of runway centerline and maintained a course between the runway centerline and the runway edge. The PIC intended to reject the takeoff shortly after they felt an impact. The impact occurred at a ground speed of about 130 knots, after passing V1. The pilot rejected takeoff and the aircraft stopped at approximately 400 meter from the towed aircraft which stopped at the left of the runway 24 centerline at approximately 100 meters from taxiway G. The captain noticed fire on the left wing tip and immediately shut down both engines, activated the fire extinguishers of both engines and Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) and commanded to the flight attendant ""evacuation from the right"". The flight attendants opened all aircraft passenger doors and the escape slides deployed. Most of passengers were evacuated from the left forward door (L1). Both aircraft sustained substantial damage. There were no reported injuries to the accident.  The outer portion of the left wing of the Boeing 737, about 5,75 m, was severed. The ATR-42s left hand wing, outboard of the no.1 engine, was severed, along with the entire empennage. Contributing Factors: - Handling of two movements in the same area with different controllers on separate frequencies without proper coordination resulted in the lack of awareness to the controllers, pilots and towing car driver. - The communication misunderstanding of the instruction to follow ID 7703 most likely contributed the towed aircraft enter the runway. - The lighting environments in the tower cab and turning pad area of runway 24 might have diminished the capability to the controllers and pilots to recognize the towed aircraft that was installed with insufficient lightings.METAR: 12:00 UTC / 19:00 local time: WIHH 041200Z 04006KT 5000 HZ FEW017CB SCT018 30/25 Q1010 RMK CB TO SWAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSC Report number: KNKT.16.04.07.04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources: Batik Air statement  NTSC   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSC; Jakarta-Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport (HLP); 04 April 2016 photo (c) Galih Mahastra; Jakarta-Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport (HLP); 2017 photo (c) NTSC; Jakarta-Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport (HLP); 04 April 2016 photo (c) NTSC; Jakarta-Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport (HLP); 04 April 2016 photo (c) NTSC; Jakarta-Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport (HLP); 04 April 2016 photo (c) Leslie Snelleman; Toulouse-Blagnac Airport (TLS/LFBO); 14 September 2014 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Approximately two minutes before 9H-AMZ landed, with the aircraft flying a stabilised final approach about 4 NM from the runway threshold, an Airbus A319 commenced its take-off run from the start of runway 05 and took off around 40 seconds later. The crew of 9H-AMZ flew over the displaced threshold of runway 05 with the correct approach profile and at the correct reference speed, and commenced the flare at a radio altitude of 10 ft. Moments later, the aircraft was caught by a positive wind shear of around 13 kt and rolled into a slight right bank, which the crew countered with an aileron deflection to the left. Immediately afterwards, the aircraft suddenly and severely rolled on its longitudinal axis to a left bank angle of 12.1Â°. The crew immediately countered this with a vigorous aileron deflection to the right. Nevertheless, 9H-AMZ struck the runway with its left wingtip and subsequently touched down with the main landing gear whilst at an almost horizontal bank attitude. The process of slowing down and taxiing from the runway was uneventful.  The occupants of 9H-AMZ were not injured. The aircraft was damaged on the left outer leading-edge slat. Causes The accident, in which a business aircraft touched the runway with one wingtip (wingtip strike), can be attributed to a high bank angle during the landing flare. The most probable cause for this high bank angle was found to be wake turbulence from a commercial aircraft that had previously taken off on the runway, which caused the business aircraft to roll around its longitudinal axis. The accident was caused by the combination of the following factors: - Light wind weather conditions, which delayed the decay of wingtip vortices; - A prolonged landing flare near the ground, which led to a touchdown at the end of the landing zone at low airspeed; - Insufficient distance between the displaced runway threshold and the point of rotation of an aircraft, which had previously taken off.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: STSB Report number: 2359 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 years and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft was attached to the Hiko Tenkentai Flight Check Squadron based at Iruma Air Base. The accident plane took off from Iruma at 08:49 for a check flight to Kanoya Air Base, and after planned check at Kanoya in the morning, it landed at Kanoya at 12:06.  After refueling, the plane took off at 13:15, and performed the remaining check of the JAT TACAN.  At 14:31, the plane began the 'alignment orbit check' following a low pass over runway 08R.  In this check, the plane lost radar contact while flying an anti-clock-wise 6nm arc with an altitude of 3000 feet after climbing from 2500 feet.  The wreckage was found by a search party of Japan Grand Self-Defense Force on 7th April on Ontake peak of Mt. Takakuma, which has an elevation of 1182m (3875 feet). At the time of the accident, the captain acted as Pilot Not Flying and F/O was Pilot Flying. A GPWS warning sounded 12 seconds before the crash, however, the warning was switched off 2 seconds before the crash without any avoidance maneuvers. The cause of the accident was continued flight until the crash on 6nm arc from Kanoya JAT TACAN with an altitude of 3000 feet.  The factors of the accident were: PIC's misidentification on the heights of mountains under the planned flight path, visual obscuration near and/or in the clouds after climbing from 2500 feet to 3000 feet, and no adequate response to the GPWS warning. A contribution factor of insufficient supervision to the flight plan is also identified.Sources: Yahoo Japan  mainichi.jp   Location  Images: photo (c) Esa Kaihlanen; Ibaraki Airport (RJAH); 30 October 2013 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The three occupants were injured.  The aircraft took off from runway 04 at Puerto GaitÃ¡n Airport about 06:22 hours local time. Upon rotation of the aircraft, the crew heard an explosion from the no.1 (left) engine. The pilot noticed that the no.1 engine cover had torn away, hitting the propeller blades. The aircraft began to lose height and speed and the crew decided to perform an emergency landing in a field.  The aircraft struck the ground causing detachment of the propellers and parts of the aircraft. After coming to rest, a post-impact fire started that consumed much of the aircraft.  An inspection of the engine revealed that one of the cylinder heads had broken away. Parts were found near the end of the runway. Probable cause: Wrong application by the crew of the emergency procedure due to engine No. 1 failure, since they reduced the RPM of the operative engine (No. 2), causing the BMEP limit to be exceeded, producing an engine stall (No. 2), making the flight of the plane impossible and forcing the execution of a forced landing. Contributing Factors: Engine failure No. 1, caused by the detachment of the head of a cylinder during take-off.

The aircraft took off from Tekin Airport at 13:56 hours local time on a VFR flight to Kiunga. On board were the pilot-in-command and 11 passengers: eight adults and three infants. In addition to the passengers and their baggage, the aircraft was carrying a significant quantity of vegetables.  The weather at Kiunga was reported to be fine. As the aircraft entered the Kiunga circuit area, the pilot cancelled SARWATCH with Air Traffic Services (ATS). The pilot did not report an emergency to indicate a safety concern. Witnesses reported that during its final approach, the aircraft suddenly pitched up almost to the vertical, the right wing dropped, and the aircraft rolled inverted and rapidly ""fell to the ground"". It impacted the terrain about 1,200 metres west of the threshold of runway 07. The impact was vertical, with almost no forward motion. The aircraft was destroyed, and all occupants were fatally injured. The investigation found that the right-wing fuel tank was empty. There was no evidence of pre- or postimpact fuel leakage. The backing plate behind the fuel selectors was bent during the impact, and had jammed the left selector in its selected position. It appeared that the pilot may have been cross feeding fuel from the left-wing tank to feed the right engine. The aircraft had been reweighed 5 months prior to the accident. The operator had not sought to obtain CASA approval of the new weight and balance data sheet for inclusion in the Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM). There was no evidence that the pilot had computed load distribution within the aircraft. The investigation determined that while the aircraft was within the weight limitations, the load distribution placed it in a significantly aft centre of gravity (c of g) situation for takeoff and landing.  The investigation determined that the right engine had failed, probably subsequent to the SARWATCH broadcast, but sufficiently before the aircraft pitched nose up, in order for the pilot to have had time to wind in full nose-left rudder trim to counteract the aerodynamic forces imposed by the failure of the right engine. Contributing factor: The aircraftÂs centre of gravity was significantly aft of the aft limit. When landing flap was set, full nose-down elevator and elevator trim was likely to have had no effect in lowering the nose of the aircraft. Unless the flaps had been retracted immediately, the nose-up pitch may also have resulted in tailplane stall, exacerbating the pitch up. The wings stalled, followed immediately by the right wing dropping. Recovery from the stall at such a low height was not considered possible. Other factors Other factors is used for safety deficiencies or concerns that are identified during the course of the investigation, that while not causal to the accident, nevertheless should be addressed with the aim of accident and serious incident prevention, and the safety of the travelling public. a) Following the reweighing of SBC, the operator did not make adjustments to account for the shift of the moment arm as a result of the reweighing. Specifically, a reduction of allowable maximum weight in the baggage compartment. b) The pilot, although signing the flight manifest on previous flights attesting that the aircraft was loaded within c of g limits, had not computed the c of g. No documentation was available to confirm that the pilot had computed the c of g for the accident flight, or any recent flights. c) All of the High Frequency radio transmissions between Air Traffic Services and SBC were significantly affected by static interference and a lot of hash, making reception difficult, and many transmissions unclear and unreadable. This is a safety concern to be addressed to ensure that vital operational radio transmissions are not missed for the safety of aircraft operations, and the travelling public.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIC PNG Report number: AIC 16-1002 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  23 April 2014 P2-SBC Sunbird Aviation PNG 0 Kikori Airport (KRI) sub Runway excursion Location  Images: photo (c) Flite Sefti; Kiunga Airport (UNG/AYKI); 23 April 2016 photo (c) Flite Sefti; Kiunga Airport (UNG/AYKI); 23 April 2016 photo (c) PNG AIC; near Kiunga Airport (UNG/AYKI); 13 April 2016 photo (c) PNG AIC; near Kiunga Airport (UNG/AYKI); 13 April 2016 photo (c) PNG AIC; near Kiunga Airport (UNG/AYKI); April 2016 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft, a Beechcraft 1900D, was scheduled to depart Goose Bay Airport at 19:20 and arrive at the Gander at 20:54. The flight was operated by Exploits Valley Air Services. Before departing, the captain checked the weather at Gander and the alternate airport, Deer Lake Airport (CYDF). The visibility at Gander was 1/8 statute miles (sm) in heavy snow. The weather forecast for the time of arrival was wind 360Â° magnetic (M) at 35 knots, gusting to 55 knots; visibility 1/4 sm in heavy snow and blowing snow; vertical visibility 100 feet above ground level (agl). Starting at 22:30, the visibility was forecast to increase to 1/2 sm in moderate snow and blowing snow, and the vertical visibility was to improve to an overcast ceiling at 400 feet agl. A significant meteorological information (SIGMET) message was issued indicating severe turbulence below 3000 feet agl over an area of Newfoundland that included Gander. The crew planned to conduct the instrument landing system with distance measuring equipment precision approach for runway 03 (ILS/DME RWY 03) at Gander.  The captain called the company's acting operations manager to discuss the potential operational impact if the flight had to divert to its alternate. At first, the intent was to delay the flight for an hour to wait for the snowfall intensity to diminish and for the visibility to improve. However, after speaking with the acting operations manager, the captain decided to depart as scheduled, anticipating that the weather conditions would improve by the time they reached Gander. The crew was unaware that other carriers had cancelled their flights to Gander.  The aircraft departed at 19:45 on an instrument flight rules flight plan. There were 14 passengers and 2 crew members on board. The first officer (F/O) was the pilot flying. While en route, the F/O indicated that he did not feel comfortable conducting the approach and landing due to his limited experience and the potential challenges associated with the anticipated weather conditions. The captain agreed to conduct the approach and landing. During the flight, the crew received updated weather reports from both the Gander Area Control Centre and Gander Tower, which indicated an increase in visibility from 1/8 sm to 1/2 sm and a reduction in the snowfall intensity from heavy to light. The crew decided that the visibility was sufficient to conduct the approach as initially planned. The winds and blowing snow were not identified as concerns. While the flight was en route, snow removal was in progress at Gander. The airport plows were focused on clearing the middle 120 feet of the 200-foot-wide runway. The plows had pushed the snow into windrows along both sides of the runway, about 60 feet from the centreline. The crew contacted the tower controller for the runway surface condition report. The latest runway condition report for runway 03, taken at 2044, was as follows: 120 feet cleared width, 40% dry snow with a depth of 0.13 inches and 60% bare and dry; remaining width 100% dry snow with a depth of 4 inches; remarks - windrows along reported width with a depth of 10 inches. The snowplows continued plowing the runway until about 21:10, at which point they began to plow a path for the aircraft to follow from the runway to the apron. On the approach, about 12 minutes before touchdown, the aircraft began to encounter moderate turbulence through 5700 feet above sea level. This turbulence continued until landing and was significant enough that the passengers were experiencing discomfort. Once the aircraft intercepted the localizer, control of the aircraft was transferred to the captain as planned. The landing gear was lowered and the flaps were set to full, as per the company's standard operating procedures. At 21:24, the tower controller cleared flight 7804 to land and provided the crew with the current tower winds of 360Â°M at 36 knots, gusting to 44 knots. The crew acquired the runway approach lighting at about 800 feet agl, more than 2 nautical miles (nm) from the threshold. At approximately 21:30, while on short final, the crew asked for a wind update. The tower controller informed the crew that the tower winds were currently unavailable and provided the last aerodrome special meteorological report (SPECI), which had been taken 18 minutes before. The SPECI indicated that the winds were 350Â°M at 29 knots, gusting to 41 knots. In the landing flare, the captain asked the F/O to call out the heights on the radar altimeter to help them determine how high they were above the ground. Almost immediately, the 10- and 0-foot calls were made. There was no indication that the crew lost visual contact with the runway edge lighting. At about 21:30, the aircraft touched down on its main landing gear (MLG) to the right of the centreline at a normal descent rate and in a relatively flat attitude about 2800 feet from the threshold. The crew was unaware how far to the right of the centreline they were when they touched down. Almost immediately, the aircraft veered to the right when the right-side MLG encountered snow. The nose landing gear (NLG) struck the windrow of compacted snow, which caused the NLG to collapse. As the aircraft's nose began to drop, the propeller blades struck the snow and runway surface. All of the left-side propeller blades and 3 of the right-side propeller blades separated at the blade root. A portion of a blade tip from the right-side propeller penetrated the cabin wall at floor level. The aircraft slid down the runway, with the nose coming within 27 feet of the runway edge, before crossing back through the windrow toward the centreline. The aircraft came to a stop about 14 seconds after touchdown on a heading of about 350Â°M. The nose was about 15 feet to the right of the centreline and 3400 feet from the threshold. Once the aircraft came to a stop, the F/O opened the cabin door and evacuated the passengers. The captain shut down the engines. The tower controller did not have any ground radar and was unaware that the aircraft was stopped on the runway. The captain contacted the tower controller to report the situation and request assistance. The tower controller immediately activated the crash bell. The first fire truck left the station within 1 minute of the crash bell being activated. About 2 minutes later, the plow drivers, who were cross-trained as fire rescue personnel, drove the remaining 2 fire trucks and the rescue vehicle to the aircraft. Because the location of the aircraft was not known, the vehicles started at the north end of runway 03. They proceeded cautiously because of the reduced visibility from blowing snow and because the passengers were out on the runway. The first fire truck arrived at the aircraft about 6 minutes after the accident. In total, 3 fire trucks, 1 rescue vehicle, and 2 pickup trucks responded. Once the firefighters established that there was no fire, the rescue vehicle and pickup trucks started transporting passengers to the terminal. Within 25 minutes of the crash bell being activated, all passengers and crew had been transported to the terminal. Three passengers sustained minor injuries. None of the injuries were attributed to the portion of the propeller blade that had penetrated the cabin. Findings as to causes and contributing factors: 1. Neither pilot had considered that the combination of landing at night, in reduced visibility, with a crosswind and blowing snow, on a runway with no centreline lighting, was a hazard that may create additional risks. 2. The blowing snow made it difficult to identify the runway centreline markings, thereby reducing visual cues available to the captain. This situation was exacerbated by the absence of centreline lighting and a possible visual illusion caused by blowing snow. 3. Due to the gusty crosswind conditions, the aircraft drifted to the right during the landing flare, which was not recognized by the crew. 4. It is likely that the captain had difficulty determining aircraft position during the landing flare. 5. The flight crew's decision to continue with the landing was consistent with plan continuation bias. 6. During landing, the nosewheel struck the compacted snow windrow on the runway, causing the nose landing gear to collapse.METAR: 00:00 UTC / 21:30 local time: METAR CYQX 210000Z CCB 33036G52KT 1/2SM R03/2800V5000FT/N R13/3000V5500FT/N -SN BLSN OVC007 M03/M04 A2930 RMK BLSN6SF2 /S33/SLP931=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A16A0041 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: CADORS  Air Canada   Location  Images: photo (c) Transportation Safety Board of Canada; Gander Airport, NF (YQX/CYQX); 20 April 2016; (CC:by-nc-nd) photo (c) Transportation Safety Board of Canada; Gander Airport, NF (YQX/CYQX); 20 April 2016; (CC:by-nc-nd) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane sustained substantial damage and there were no reported injuries among the 6 crew and 87 passengers onboard. The aircraft departed Quito at 06:51 hours local time.  During the landing preparation briefing, at 07:34, the pilot indicated that they would hold the glide slope until they had a runway in sight, inhibit the glide slope alarm, and continue visual. Four minutes later the flight was cleared for the VOR ILS ZULU approach for runway 23. The runway was wet due to drizzle and the braking efficiency reported by an Airbus A319 was good to average. The A319 had landed on the runway in Cuenca 36 minutes before flight 173.  At 07:46, the flight radioed that they were ten miles out and established on the localizer. They were cleared to the ILS approach for runway 23. Three minutes later the controller reported that they had flight 173 in sight and informed that the wind was calm, and cleared the flight to land on runway 23. T At 07:50, the pilot indicated that he had three red and one white lights on the PAPI system.  The aircraft crossed the runway threshold at 37 feet high instead of 50 feet, which meant the aircraft approached below the normal glidepath. It touched down 277 m past the threshold at an airspeed of 127 knots. Spoilers were deployed 585 meters from the threshold, followed by reverses at 643 m. The pilot, not feeling an effective braking of the aircraft, tried to activate the autobrake system but this did not work. The aircraft was hydroplaning and could not be brought to a halt on the runway. The pilot groundlooped the aircraft on the grass. Runway 23 is a 1900 m long runway with an upslope of 15 m (+0.78%). Distance from the centre of the end of the paved runway to the boundary fence and an active road is 31 m.	The Operational Landing Distance calculations with manual braking for the weight of the aircraft with wind on touchdown, indicate that a runway length of 2,122 meters was necessary. PROBABLE CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS (translated from Spanish language report) The Accident Investigation Board determines that the probable causes of this accident were: 1. The condition of the runway at Cuenca airport, which at the time of the plane's landing was contaminated with water and slippery. 2. The landing was made after a non-stabilized approach with a tailwind. 3. The non-application of the Maximum Performance Landing procedure recommended by the aircraft manufacturer for landing on contaminated runways. The following factors contributed to this event: 1. The dispatch of the flight with 1,500 kg of fuel more than the amount of fuel usually used for this flight. 2. Omission of the runway length calculation necessary to perform the landing using the braking efficiency information. 3. The crew's decision to make the final approach with three red and one white lights, using the PAPI system, induced by the information in the Terminal Information document issued by the company, which authorised this procedure. 4. The use of confusing terminology in the Terminal Information document, which used terms applicable to the Airbus fleet, instead of Embraer's. 5. The crew's decision not to perform the thwarted approach maneuver after the maximum allowable vertical speed was exceeded and visibility was apparently limited after the minima were exceeded. 6. Incorrect use of aircraft braking aids, in this case reverse braking aids 7. The application of the emergency brake that inhibits the antiskid system. 8. Lack of implementation of adequate management of crew resources, particularly within the cockpit. 9. Lack of training in the use of tables for track distance calculation.METAR: 12:00 UTC / 07:00 local time: SECU 281200Z 35003KT 9999 -RA FEW010 OVC030 13/12 Q102713:00 UTC / 08:00 local time: SECU 281300Z 33003KT 8000 -RA FEW010 OVC030 13/12 Q1028Wind: 330 degrees at 3 knots; visibility 8000 m in light rain; few clouds at 1000 feet, overcast at 3000 feet; Temperature 13Â°C; Dew point 12Â°C; QNH 1028 mbAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: JIA Ecuador Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Cuenca Airport statement  aerospotter.blogspot.com   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft, a Fokker 50, operated by Amapola Flyg on behalf of Air VallÃ©e, departed Rimini at 08:49 on a domestic service to Catania. The aircraft was approaching runway 08 at Catania Airport when the nose landing gear failed to deploy. The approach was abandoned about 10:37 hours. The airplane climbed to 2900 feet and entered a holding pattern to the east of the airport while the crew tried to troubleshoot the problem.  Finally a forced landing was carried out on runway 08 at 11:34 with the nose gear doors open but the nose gear retracted. CAUSES   The accident was caused by the failure of the nose landing gear (nose gear up) due to over-extension of the shock absorber which caused interference between the tires and the NLG compartment and locked the NLG in a retracted position.  The over-extension was caused by the incorrect installation of some internal components of the shock absorber during the replacement of the internal seals the day before the accident.   The following factors contributed significantly to the improper activity conducted at maintenance:  - the insufficient experience of technical personnel in carrying out the maintenance tasks conducted on the NLG;  - the lack of controls on the operations carried out, deemed unnecessary by the CAMO engineering department;  - the lack of definition of roles and tasks during the planning phase of the maintenance work;  - the operational pressure on maintenance personnel, arising from the need to conclude maintenance operations quickly in order not to penalize the management of the aircraft;  - the insufficient clarity and lack of sensitive information in the maintenance tasks and related figures contained in the AMM, regarding the replacement of internal shock absorber seals, subsequently made clearer by the manufacturer;  - the reported black and white printing of the applied AMM procedures, which could have made the warnings in the manual barely legible.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ANSV Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 years and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: ANSV  Repubblica.it  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight departed at 01:30 UTC and scheduled to arrive at Soekarno-Hatta International Airport Jakarta, at 07:46 UTC. The prognosis chart issued by World Area Forecast Center (WAFC) London which was the part of briefing material for the pilots prior to departure, showed possible thunderstorms and development of cumulonimbus clouds up to above FL470 at around Sumatra Island. Onboard the flight were 274 occupants: three pilots, nine cabin crew members and 262 passengers. The flight was uneventful since departure until about 15 minutes commencing to descend when the cabin crews were preparing for arrival procedure and some passengers were not wearing the seatbelt. At 06:40:10 UTC, the aircraft was on cruising at FL 390 and encountered severe turbulence for 22 seconds. The severe turbulence caused one cabin crew and six passengers sustained serious injuries, while three cabin crew and 14 passengers sustained minor injuries. Several aircraft interior parts were damaged such as detached ceiling, broken passenger service units and dropped oxygen mask containers. Approximate 30 seconds after encountering the severe turbulence, the aircraft was in stable flight and the flight was continued to Soekarno-Hatta International Airport Jakarta.

The airplane was operated by the pilot as a familiarization flight. The commercial pilot and sole passenger were not injured. The airplane departed the Upland-Cable Airport, California, about 11:45.  The pilot stated to the NTSB that the flight was a familiarization flight for a new member of their chapter of the Commemorative Air Force. The flight departed the Cable airport and flew east along the mountains, headed to San Bernardino. They contacted the San Bernardino tower and were instructed to enter the crosswind for runway 24. As part of the before landing checklist, the pilot turned on the carburetor heat and switched the fuel tank selector to the right fuel tank. Shortly thereafter, the engine lost all power. The pilot attempted numerous times to restart the engine, but was unsuccessful.  The pilot realized that he would not be able to reach the airport, and decided to make a forced landing to a small field in a residential area. During the landing approach, the airplane contacted a power line. After touching down in the field the airplane nosed over and came to rest inverted, which resulted in substantial damage to the wings and fuselage. During the postaccident examination of the airplane, about 16 ounces of water were removed from the fuel system.  Water was present in the lower gascolator, the fine fuel filter (upper gascolator), and subsequent fuel line to the carburetor inlet.  A brass screen at the carburetor inlet and 2 carburetor fuel bowl thumb screens also contained corrosion, water, and rust.   The approved aircraft inspection checklist called for washing the carburetor and main fuel filter every 50 hours and cleaning and/or replacing the fine fuel filter every 100 hours.  The fine fuel filter is not easily accessible and not able to be drained during a preflight inspection. The mechanic who completed the most recent inspection stated that he did not drain or check the fine fuel filter. The last logbook entry that specifically stated the fuel filters were cleaned was about 4 years before the accident. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The mechanicÂs failure to inspect the fine fuel filter gascolator as required during the most recent inspection, which resulted in a total loss of engine power due to fuel contamination.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: WPR16LA101 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 12 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft departed Delhi Airport as flight 9W2793 at 17:40 local time (12:10 UTC). While en route ATIS was obtained by the crew approximately at 115 NM from Indore and the arrival briefing was completed at 100 NM from Indore. The crew asked ATC for permission to descend at 19:10, much before their descent point, so as to keep clear of weather and avoid turbulence. The winds reported by ATC were 130Â° and 08 knots. As the winds were favourable for runway 07 the crew decided for a VOR approach to runway 07 via DME arc. At 19:23 crew reported commencing the arc. While on final approach the crew asked for winds, ATC informed crew that the winds were 320Â° and 12 knots. The crew also saw tail winds on their Primary Flight Display (PFD) and decided to discontinue the approach. ATC then cleared the aircraft for an ILS approach to runway 25 from overhead. The crew then requested an ILS approach to runway 25 via the DME arc, as there was weather overhead. This was accepted by ATC at 19:31. At the same time ATC also informed crew that winds were then 100Â° and 12 knots. The aircraft climbed 4000 feet and was kept left of the runway, keeping runway in visual contact. The crew continued with the approach and went out for 15 NM to avoid weather before turning right to intercept the ILS. The flight reported established on localizer at 19:37 and was informed by ATC of moderate rain on airfield. At 19:38 crew reported intercepting ILS and was cleared to land with reported winds of 13 knots at 160Â°. As per the statement of crew the approach was clear and runway lights could be seen from 13 NM. The runway lights and PAPI lights appeared bright and hence the crew requested ATC to reduce the intensity of the lights. As the aircraft descended through 600 feet, auto pilot was disconnected. After the aircraft touched down, it veered to the right. The PIC tried to control the aircraft using rudder to turn it to the left. However aircraft went excessively to the left. The PIC was also warned by the co-pilot about the aircraft heading. The aircraft continued going left even after application of full right rudder by the PIC. The aircraft subsequently went out of the runway into the unpaved surface on left, damaging runway edge lights, runway marking light and a taxiway edge light. The aircraft travelled approximately 180 meters on the unpaved surface while jumping a pit and crossing taxiway F near the isolation bay before coming to halt 78 meters away from runway centre line, with heading 204Â°. Probable cause of the Accident: Improper cross wind landing technique and failure to use nose wheel steering or differential braking after rudder efficiency was diminished due to decreasing speed caused the aircraft to veer out of runway. The runway condition was a contributory factor.METAR: 13:00 UTC / 18:30 local time: VAID 071300Z 10009KT 5000 -TS FEW020 SCT025 FEWCB030 33/16 Q1009 NOSIG15:00 UTC / 20:30 local time: VAID 071500Z 18014KT 5000 -TS FEW020 SCT025 FEWCB030 27/19 Q1010 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB India Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources: Images: photo (c) AAIB India; Indore Airport (IDR); 07 May 2016 photo (c) AAIB India; Indore Airport (IDR); 07 May 2016 photo (c) AAIB India; Indore Airport (IDR); 07 May 2016 photo (c) Flightradar24; Indore Airport (IDR); 07 May 2016 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane sustained substantial damage. The pilot, flight instructor, and two passengers were uninjured. The airplane was operated as an instructional flight that was not operating on a flight plan. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight that last departed from Jonesboro Municipal Airport, Arkansas at 16:50 and was destined to DXE. The pilot stated that the purpose of the flight was a Beechcraft B100 initial training flight with a second pilot who occupied the right pilot seat. According to the Federal Aviation Administration inspector, the flight instructor was in a non-seated position between both pilots. The left seat pilot stated that they flew about 3 hours and had taken turns performing turns, stalls, slow flight and approaches. He stated that the accident landing was the third landing of the day that he performed. He said that during the left downwind approach for landing on runway 18, he performed the airplane checklist items that the flight instructor read to him. The left seat pilot said that the landing gear extended, and the three landing gear position indicator lights illuminated green. The left seat pilot said that during touchdown, the right side of the airplane descended lower than the left side and then the right main landing gear collapsed. The airplane veered off and into a grass area adjacent to the runway. The aircraft came to rest approximately 2,518 feet from runway 18 touchdown end and 100 feet west of the runway edge in a field of grass. The right hand main gear was collapsed, right hand prop blades were bent and the right wing leading edge and tip was damaged. Evidence of fuel leakage was noted surrounding the right wing in the grass. The wing top skin outboard of the engine nacelle displayed evidence of wrinkling. Post-accident examination revealed the bottom right wing skin to the integral fuel tank was torn resulting in an approximate five by three inch hole. The right main gear actuator assembly exhibited numerous bent parts and was broken out of its mounting structure. The inboard top actuator mounting structure was torn away from the airframe. The right nacelle fuel tank bulkhead was ruptured with the top of the gear actuator resting inside the tank area. The top wing skin wrinkling was not as evident post recovery but still shows signs of damage. Puncture damage to the fuselage pressure vessel was noted in 5 places below the copilot side window and a two-inch crack or tear was found on the belly skin approximately centered between the main gear legs. The rigging for the landing gear system could not be checked nor could functional gear swing test be performed due to damage incurred to the system from the accident. The accident aircraft, N86TR, was involved in a gear-up landing incident On November 17, 2005 at Fulton County Airport, Atlanta.

The pilot suffered a minor injury, but none of the 17 skydivers on board were injured. The pilot reported that following takeoff from runway 26, he made a right turn and continued his climb for the skydive drop, however, while passing through 1,000 feet above ground level, the engine lost power. The pilot initiated a turn toward the airport, however, realized he was unable to make it, and landed in an open field. During the landing roll, the airplane exited the field, crossed E Jahant Road, impacted a truck, continued into a vineyard, and nosed over. Postaccident examination of the engine revealed that the fuel pressure line that connects the fuel control unit to the airframe fuel pressure transducer was fractured below the fuel control unit fitting's swaged seat. In addition, a supporting clamp for the fuel pressure fuel line was fractured and separated. The operator reported that the fractured fuel line had been replaced the night before the accident and had accumulated about 4 hours of operational time. The previously-installed line had also fractured. Probable Cause and Findings: ""A total loss of engine power due to a fatigue fracture of the fuel pressure line that connected the fuel control unit and the fuel flow transducer due to vibration as the result of a fatigue fracture of an associated support clamp.

Seven of the nine occupants suffered fatal injuries. The crew planned to fly from Baku (Azerbaijan) to Bagram (Afghanistan), Dwyer (Afghanistan), Mary (Turkmenistan) and then back to Baku. The flight legs to Dwyer Airport were uneventful.  At 13:11 the crew started the engines on the apron at Dwyer Airport. Engine no.2 was the last to be started up at 13:47 hours. Before the takeoff the captain distributed the duties within the crew, nominating the first officer as the Pilot Flying, and himself as Pilot Monitoring. After the engine startup the crew initiated taxiing to perform takeoff on runway 23. The concrete runway at Dwyer measured 2439 m by 37 m.  In the course of the takeoff preparations, at 13:57:56 the flight mechanic reported an increase in MGT of engine no.3 above the acceptable level: ""Engine 3, look, engine temperature over six hundred, over seven hundred"", which was confirmed by the first officer: ""Yes, itÂs getting temperature"" while the captain asked to be more attentive. The takeoff was performed with Flaps 15. As the checklist was being read, the captain ordered to lock the propellers. After the captain's order to lock the propellers a slight increase in torque values was recorded on engine no.1 and 4, and in 17 seconds also engine no.2. There was no evidence that the propeller of engine no.3 was locked. At 13:59:42 the crew initiated the takeoff. Before the takeoff the ATC advised the crew on the wind direction and speed on the runway: 280Â° 14 knots (7 m/sec) gusting 26 knots (13 m/sec). Thus it was quartering headwind and the headwind component might have been 5 to 9 m/sec. While performing takeoff the crew first increased thrust on engines no.1 and no.4 and then on engine no.2 after 10 seconds. The thrust of the three engines was about 50 kg/sq.cm as per torque indicator (lower than takeoff mode). The third engine was still operating in the ground idle mode, though the CVR did not record any crew callouts concerning engine no.3 operation parameters. Based on the CCTV system of Dwyer Airport the takeoff roll was initiated almost from the runway threshold and was conducted to the left of the runway centerline. No significant deviations from the takeoff course during the takeoff roll were recorded. During the takeoff roll the rudder was deflected left close to extreme. Probably the pilots were also applying differential control on engine no.2 to decrease the right torque moment. At 14:00:14 at approximately 120 km/h IAS the ""Engine no.3 negative thrust"" signal started. At that time the aircraft was about 430 m away from the start of the takeoff roll. At 14:00:42 engines no.1 and no.4 thrust was increased up to 63 kg/sq.cm as per torque indicator (consistent with takeoff mode for the actual flight conditions). At that time the IAS was about 150 km/h. Engine no.2 thrust was increased up to the same value only 23 seconds later at about 200 km/h IAS. At that time the aircraft was about 840 m away from the runway end. Engine no.3 was still operating in ground idle mode. Approximately 260 m before the runway end at a speed of 220 km/h IAS (maximum speed reached) nose up input on the control column was started. The aircraft did not lift off. After rolling all along the runway the aircraft overran the runway onto the ground at a speed of 220 km/h. While moving on the ground the aircraft sustained significant damage, which led to a post-crash fire that destroyed most of the aircraft structures. Out of the nine persons on board seven were killed and two were seriously injured and taken to hospital. The accident with the An-12B 4K-AZ25 aircraft was caused by the decision of the crew to take off with a failed engine No. 3, the propeller of which was not feathered. During the entire takeoff run, engine No. 3 remained at ground idle, as a result of which the engine propeller created a negative thrust that increased as the speed increased, preventing the crew from reaching the take-off speed of the aircraft from the runway. The crew did not take measures to stop the takeoff, which led to the aircraft overrunning the runway at a speed of 220 km/h, its destruction, followed by fire.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: APA  Stripes.com  MAK   Location  Images: photo (c) MAK; Dwyer Airport (DWR); May 2016 photo (c) MAK; Dwyer Airport (DWR); 18 May 2016 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Flight MS804 departed Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport, France, at 21:21 UTC (23:21 hours local time on May 18). Scheduled departure time was 22:45 LT. Destination of the flight was Cairo, Egypt. At 23:22 UTC the flight entered Greek airspace at FL370. Last radio contact was at 23:48 UTC during a radio frequency change. At 00:25:24 UTC a hissing sound was heard in the cockpit, followed by a 'pop' and a second hissing sound. The captain, copilot and a flight attendant sitting in the jump seat all exclaimed ""fire!"". The copilot then called for a fire extinguisher. From 00:25:58 UTC on the Flight Data Recorder began logging multiple warnings, like 'Lavatory smoke', 'Avionic smoke', and Master Warnings. This continued with additional warnings and errors until the end of the recording. At 00:27:23, ATC instructed the flight to contact Cairo ACC, but no reply was received. The aircraft suddenly taking a 90 degree turn left, followed by a 360 degree turn to the right as it descended from FL370 to FL150 before disappearing off radars. The aircraft impacted the surface of the sea. The Flight Data Recorder and Cockpit Voice Recorder were both recovered from the sea bed on June 16, 2016.  The Egyptian AAID published its final report on October 30, 2024, concluding: Probable cause The aircraft flight path was uncontrollable as the aircraft and the flight crew were severely affected by fire and smoke. This resulted from the effects of the explosive materials located at the forward galley just behind the rear section of the cockpit. The aircraft crashed into the sea. Contributing factors - The fire/smoke event took place very quickly and flight crew were disabled. - Several aircraft systems failure. - Explosion resulted in oxygen flow in the cockpit, which enriched the fire/ smoke. BEA France commented on the EAAID's findings and remarked: The factual accuracy of the report is questionable, and the reasoning for the scenarios appears to distort the facts. The report repeatedly mentions the presence of French experts concerning the discovery of TNT. The BEA would like to emphasize that the French experts acted as advisors and observers and had neither the role nor the possibility of validating any findings concerning the presence of explosives on human remains. The French experts involved indicated that the results obtained do not allow for a definitive conclusion regarding the presence of TNT. However, the presence of TNT is never questioned and is taken as an assumption or even as a starting point in all scenario analyses. This leads to an unrealistic scenario incompatible with the sequence of warnings, failures and crew announcements. The BEA disagrees with the scenario established by the investigation committee and maintains the conclusions drawn from its study: The accident sequence began while the aeroplane was cruising at FL370, with a cabin crew member present in the cockpit, the captain resting in his seat and the co-pilot flying. It has not been possible to precisely explain the start of the accident sequence. It is likely to have been an oxygen flow resulting either from a component failure (in the oxygen storage box or in the upstream distribution system) or from pressing the EMERGENCY knob on the co-pilot's oxygen mask. A fire then started in the mask storage box, and was fed by a leak of pressurised oxygen. It has not been possible to determine which came first: the fire or the oxygen leak. Whichever the case, the oxygen-fed fire spread to the outside of the storage box. This type of fire is rapid, large-scale and uncontrollable. It produces a characteristic noise comparable to that of a blowtorch. The protective and extinguishing equipment items in the cockpit were not sufficient to bring the fire under control. The fire damaged the computer power supply systems, which led to the disconnection of the autopilot in particular. No crew actions were recorded in the cockpit. It has not been possible to determine whether the crew remained in the cockpit, whether they were unconscious or whether they fled the fire and then returned or remained outside the cockpit. The aeroplaneâs flight path was uncontrolled and the aircraft collided with the sea.

The airplane stopped on the runway at the intersection C5, about 1500m down of 3360m long runway , with spread debris and trace of the brakes in the last 700m. The flight crew used two extinguishing bottles on engine no.1 to put out the fire. At 12:43, five minutes after the aircraft came to a stop, the flight crew ordered an evacuation since they received a new fire indication for engine no.1. All 319 onboard were evacuated on the runway using emergency slides from right side doors.  No serious injuries were found among 302 passengers and 17 crew members, however, 19 had medical treatments for smoke inhalation and/or bruises during evacuation, 12 sent to hospital. The accident runway were closed for five and a half hours, and three remaining runways were also closed for two hours. This incident caused more than 400 of other commercial flights to be cancelled, as well as many more diversions, delays and returns to the destination. Probable Causes It is highly probable that the causes of this accident were the fracture of the high pressure turbine (HPT) disk of the No.1 (left-side) engine during the takeoff ground roll, the penetration of the fragment through the engine case and the occurrence of subsequent fires. Regarding the cause for the 1st stage HPT disk to be fractured, it is probable that a step was machined exceeding the allowable limit when machining U-shaped groove on the aft side of the 1st stage HPT disk to manufacture the engine and from this step the low-cycle fatigue crack was initiated and propagated during running of engine. Regarding why the step could not be found, it is somewhat likely that defects failed to be detected at the time of the inspection by the manufacturer during the production process. And as for the cracks that were not found, it is somewhat likely that those cracks failed to be detected at non-destructive inspection on the disk by the Company at the time of maintenance of the engine in use. Regarding the fire breakout from the No.1 engine, it is probable that due to the impact forces generated by the release of the fragment from the ruptured rim part of the 1st stage HPT disk through the engine case and the engine rundown loads generated when the engine stopped suddenly, the cracks were developed in the outer case of the Fuel Oil Heat Exchanger and the fuel and engine oil leaking through these cracks contacted the hot area of engine cases of the No.1 engine to be ignited.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JTSB Report number: AA2018-5 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Images: photo (c) JTSB; Tokyo-Haneda Airport (HND); 27 May 2016 photo (c) JTSB; Tokyo-Haneda Airport (HND); 27 May 2016 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were no injuries among the five passengers and three crew members. The aircraft operated on a flight from Krasnodar to Neryungri with an en route stop at Tyumen. The night time approach was conducted with a visibility of 10+ km. Wind was from 350Â° at 2 m/s. There were broken clouds at 190 m and overcast with cumulonimbus clouds at 510 m. Temperature and dew point were both +4Â°C. QFE pressure was 685 mm Hg (913 hPa). During the descent the air traffic controller informed the crew that QFE (field elevation) pressure was 685 mm Hg and QNH (sea level) pressure was 1012 hPa. The flight crew radioed: ""I confirm 685, [...] is 1012 hectopascals, do we understand it correctly?"" To which the controller replied ""...QNH 1012, for information the height of the threshold is 08, 857 meters."" This was misunderstood by the flight crew. They did not convert the pressure at the runway level of 685 mm Hg to hectopascals (685 mm Hg corresponds to 913 hPa), but instead set the pressure at 1012 hPa on the altimeters and continued the descent. At 23:13:33 hours the EGPWS sounded: ""Sink rate"", followed a second later by ""Caution terrain!"" At 23:13:36 hours the EGWS again sounded: ""PULL UP"". At 23:13:53 hours, at a distance of 18 km from the threshold of runway 08, the aircraft impacted trees. The flight crew managed to regain height and performed a safe landing at Neryungri Airport. A post-flight inspection revealed damage to the wing leading edges and winglets, dents on the no.2 engine cowling, dents to the flaps and right hand horizontal stabilizer. Contributing factors (Translated from Russian): - Insufficient preparation of the crew for the flight, expressed in the fact that the crew did not have the Neryungri airfield (Chulman) ATIS frequency and had a lack of knowledge of the AIP requirements about the additional request to the ATC controller to obtain aerodrome pressure in hectopascals. There were no reference data on the Neryungri airfield (Chulman) in the airlineÂs Operations Manual; - Inattention of the crew in interpreting the QNH and QFE pressures transmitted by the controller to the aircraft; - The Standard Operating Procedures for the Air Traffic Controllers of the Neryungri Air Traffic Service Centre did not contain specific instructions for the adjustment of the Complex of the Automatic Air Traffic Control System ""Alpha""  - The Standard Operating Procedures of the Neryungri (Chulman) airport control tower did not contain control procedures for the assigned flight altitude on the descent and approach of the aircraft.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: MAK  Ministry of Transport RF   Location  Images: photo (c) MAK; Neryungri Airport (NER); June 2016 photo (c) MAK; Neryungri Airport (NER); June 2016 photo (c) MAK; Neryungri Airport (NER); June 2016 photo (c) MAK; Neryungri Airport (NER); June 2016 photo (c) MAK; Neryungri Airport (NER); June 2016 photo (c) MAK; Neryungri Airport (NER); June 2016 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

"22:43","    McDonnell Douglas MD-11F","Monday 6 June 2016","United Parcel Service - UPS","N277UP","48578/588","1995Total airframe hrs:63195 hoursCycles:11344 flights","Pratt & Whitney PW4460","0 / Occupants: 4","0","Substantial, written off","Accident","Seoul-Incheon International Airport (ICN) -   South Korea","Take off","Cargo","Seoul-Incheon International Airport (ICN/RKSI)","Anchorage-Ted Stevens International Airport, AK (ANC/PANC)"," ARAIB","Accident investigation report completed and information captured","UPS flight 5X61 suffered a runway excursion and nose gear collapse in a takeoff accident at Seoul-Incheon International Airport (ICN). The aircraft, an McDonnell Douglas MD-11F cargo plane was bound for Anchorage, Alaska.  The aircraft's takeoff weight was 629,600 lbs, which was below the maximum allowable take-off weight of 630,500 lbs. The flight was cleared for takeoff from runway 33L. The aircraft reached V1 speed after a ground run of 6413 feet. About that time the crew heard a noise, originating from the failure of the no.9 tire (the left-hand tire on the central landing gear). The no.10 tire on the same landing gear also ruptured. Vibration and torsion forces then caused the lower drag brace of the central landing gear to break. The drag brace then hit the body several times. This caused a rupture of the hydraulic system of brake system 1, reducing the total brake efficiency to about 48% as the crew rejected the takeoff. With 4,635 feet of runway remaining the aircraft began to decelerate. The aircraft required a deceleration distance of at least about 5,550ft from the position where the takeoff was rejected. As a result, the MD-11 stopped at approximately 1,591 ft (485 m) past the end of the runway 33L. The nose gear collapsed and the no. 1 and 3 engines contacted the grass. The ARAIB investigators noted that there is an inherent difficulty in determining the flight performance of an aircraft after V1 when limited information and little time is available to the crew for a go/no-go decision. The UPS flight operations manual states that after V1, rejecting takeoff is not recommended unless the captain judges that aircraft can not fly, but the manual does not establish a definition of 'non-flying'. ARAIB notes that it would be beneficial for the aviation industry to provide flight crews with definitions of 'non-flightability' and additional guidance and training as to how to judge aircraft flight performance under certain circumstances, especially after V1. CAUSE (translated from Korean): After the take-off determination speed (V1), the high-speed takeoff abandonment is performed by the tire of the central landing gear and the drag brace defect, and the runway is separated. Contributing factor is "" (1) For limited time and available information on the encountered situation, (2) Dynamic instability of dragging of central landing gear after tire failure. (3) Decrease in braking performance due to rupture of hydraulic pipe of brake system 1 "".METAR: 13:30 UTC / 22:30 local time: RKSI 061330Z 36001KT 9000 SCT040 BKN120 19/14 Q1012 NOSIG14:00 UTC / 23:00 local time: RKSI 061400Z 36002KT 9000 SCT040 BKN120 20/14 Q1012 NOSIG14:30 UTC / 23:30 local time: RKSI 061430Z 28003KT 250V320 9000 SCT040 BKN120 20/14 Q1012 NOSIG15:00 UTC / 00:00 local time: RKSI 061500Z 12002KT 8000 SCT040 BKN120 20/14 Q1012 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: ARAIB Report number: ARAIB/AAR1606 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years Download report:  Final report Sources: Yonhap  Korea Times   Location  Images: photo (c) ARAIB; Seoul-Incheon International Airport (ICN); June 2016 photo (c) ARAIB; Seoul-Incheon International Airport (ICN); June 2016 photo (c) ARAIB; Seoul-Incheon International Airport (ICN); June 2016 photo (c) ARAIB; Seoul-Incheon International Airport (ICN); June 2016 photo (c) ARAIB; Seoul-Incheon International Airport (ICN); 06 June 2016 photo (c) ARAIB; Seoul-Incheon International Airport (ICN); 06 June 2016 photo (c) Konstantin Von Wedelstaedt; Dubai Airport (DXB/OMDB); 24 October 2008 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.
