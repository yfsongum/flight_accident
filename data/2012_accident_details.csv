The four passengers and two pilots survived. The aircraft left Mombasa-Moi International Airport to drop and pick up passengers at several airstrips in the Masai Mara game reserve. The crew had a day stop in Olkiombo Airstrip before beginning their usual pick-up routine before returning back to Mombasa. The crew testified to have topped up 200 litres of fuel before departing Olkiombo for Kicha Tembo airstrip where they were to pick up four passengers and another 15 passengers from Musiara Airstrip. The first officer reported to have put one large bag at the nose luggage compartment while the rest of the lighter luggage was place at the rear luggage compartment. On the take off roll on Tembo's runway 08, the first officer, who was Pilot Flying, reported to have hit a bump half way down the runway and bounced.  The aircraft hit a second bump and again went airborne prematurely. At that moment the crew reported to have heard a continuous stall warning horn. The pilot flying recalled the pilot monitoring retarding the throttles, an action which made him realize that they were aborting take off. The pilot monitoring reported that there was a bit of tug on the controls between the two of them with the first officer (PF) pushing the control column down for a nose down attitude and the captain (PNF) trying to ease the force on the control column. With very little runway length left, the aircraft veered to the right at the end of the runway and came to a stop approximately 300 meters from the threshold of runway 26. The nose gear assembly was ripped off by the rough terrain and the rest of the aircraft ploughed through the grass for another approximately 10 meters. The aircraft front belly section was severely damaged.Sources: Preliminary accident report  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

This was a non-standard pushback to allow a Jetstream 41 on Stand 11 to taxi out via Bravo One, to Runway 02. This was completed without incident, the tug was then disconnected and all personnel and equipment cleared from the area. One minute later the Jetstream 41, having already started its engines on stand, requested and received permission to power back from Stand 111. At the end of the manoeuvre it stopped on Taxiway Alpha abeam Stand 10 and Stand 11. When DHC-8-402Q G-JEDO requested permission to push back and start from Stand 6; ATC instructed it to âSTANDBYâ. The Jetstream 41 was then given permission to taxi via Holding Point Bravo One, back track, line up and takeoff from Runway 02. G-JEDO was given permission for a standard pushback and start from Stand 62. In attendance were a headset operative and a wingman positioned to the south of the aircraft, and the tug driver. Prior to commencing the pushback the headset operative indicated the direction of the pushback to the tug driver using hand signals. Two minutes later, having seen that the tug was disconnected from G-ECOO,  ATC asked the pilots if they were ready to taxi; they replied they would be in about 30 seconds. ATC replied, âTAXI PLEASE WHEN READY [HOLDING POINT] BRAVO ONEâ. The wingman had by then left Stand 6 for another task. As G-JEDOâs pushback neared completion it slowed and then stopped on a heading of approximately 220Âº. The headset operative asked the commander to confirm that the aircraftâs brakes were OFF, which they were, then reported that they could not push the aircraft any further and asked for the aircraftâs brakes to be set ON. A passing Airside Operations vehicle reported to ATC that there was an âAIRCRAFT TO AIRCRAFT CONFLICT ON STAND 6.â G-ECOO then transmitted to ATC âWE JUST FELT A BUMPâ and asked for confirmation that they had been hit.

As they taxied, a ground crewmember stood by the wing to ensure the airplaneâs clearance from another airlineâs equipment and signaled thumbs up to the flight crew to indicate when they were clear of the equipment. After taxiing a short distance, the flight crew stopped and awaited further instructions from a ramp agent on the radio for positioning the airplane. Unknown to the flight crew, the deicing team misunderstood the thumbs-up signal to mean that deicing could begin. Consequently, they moved into a position behind the airplaneâs left wing and in front of the left horizontal tail. The ramp agent working the radio could not see the airplane from the radio location and, believing it was still at the gate, instructed the flight crew to taxi 50 feet and stop for deicing. The flight crew initiated taxiing and almost immediately felt a bump, colliding with the boom arm of the deice truck. They then stopped the airplane. The deice truck was not equipped for radio communication; therefore, the teamâs movement and position could not be coordinated with the other ground personnel or flight crew.  Probable Cause: The inadequate communication among ground crew personnel, which resulted in the airplaneâs collision with a deice truck.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA12LA147 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates24-Jan-2012 17:22 Geno Added 24-Feb-2012 11:41 Anon.

The airplane was operated by Swiftair under an ACMI arrangement with Gryphon Airlines.  Flight SWT094 departed Dubai Airport (DXB) at 06:08 local time on a scheduled service to Kandahar with the first officer as pilot flying. The en route part of the flight was uneventful. Kandahar approach cleared them for an RNAV (GPS) approach to runway 05, providing a direct vector to the FALOD Initial Approach Fix and to descend to 6000 ft. Runway in use was runway 05, and wind was reported from 060Â° at 17 kt gusting to 24 kt, visibility 1200 m, scattered clouds at 2700 ft and broken clouds at 3000 ft, temperature 1Â°C, dewpoint -7Â°C and QNH 1018 mbar.  The target speed associated with a landing weight of 136,000 lb was estimated at 140 KIAS (Vref 135 +5). At a radio altitude of 1000 feet the airplane was fully configured for landing with flaps 40 and landing gear down. The heading was within margins but the speed was 192 kts. It should have been between Vref (135 knots) and Vref+20 (155 knots). Also, the airplane was above the theoretical glide slope. It was also descending at a rate well in excess of 1000 ft/min. The approach was not stabilized at this point. Since the captain had more operational experience at the Kandahar, he decided to take over the controls and fly the last phase of the approach. The PAPI was out of service, meaning they only had visual references to the runway and above the ground during the final part of the approach. During short final the captain corrected a deviation from the runway centerline by adjusting the flight path from right to left. During the flare, the crew noticed the airplane was shifting to the left, threatening to take them off the runway, as a result of which the captain applied a +20Â° right bank angle at a +9Â° pitch angle. This caused the right wing tip to strike the ground before the wheels made contact with the ground. Touchdown speed was 122 knots, which was below Vref as well as the target speed . The captain regarded the maneuver as a hard landing, although the first officer thought they might have struck the runway. On exiting the runway, the airport control tower ordered the crew to stop and informed them of the damage they experienced. The wing had contacted the ground some 20 m prior to the threshold, resulting in five threshold lights being destroyed by the aircraft. CAUSES: The accident was likely caused by the failure to observe the company's operating procedures and not executing a go-around when the approach was clearly not stabilized. Moreover, the operator lacked the authorization (and the crew the training) to carry out the RNAV (GPS) approach maneuver that was conducted at RWY 05 of the Kandahar Airport. Contributing to the accident was: - The inoperable status of the PAPI at runway 05 of the Kandahar Airport, which was thus unable to aid the crew to establish the aircraft on the correct descent slope.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIAIAC Report number: EXT A-001/2012 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) Werner Fischdick; DÃ¼sseldorf Airport (DUS/EDDL); 18 July 2010 photo (c) Remo Garone; GenÃ¨ve-Cointrin Airport (GVA/LSGG); 15 December 2010 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane continued across several taxiways, and the main landing gear assemblies and the right wing tip fuel tank separated from the airframe, then the nose gear collapsed, and the airplane came to rest on a grassy area. All eight passengers and both pilots exited the airplane through the main cabin door. Postaccident examination revealed that damage to the right main landing gear torque link and both tires was consistent with the runway excursion. The cockpit voice recorder was not working properly, and audio from the accident flight was not recorded. Data downloaded from the digital electronic engine controls indicated that both engines were operating with no significant difference in thrust. An examination of the airplane's flight controls revealed no preimpact mechanical deficiencies that would have precluded normal operation.

ANA Flight NH731, had departed Osaka-Itami International Airport (ITM/RJOO) on a domestic service to Sendai. The captain was Pilot Flying. The en route part of the flight was uneventful and the weather at Sendai was fine. At 09:00 the flight was cleared to land on runway 27. Wind was reported from 160 degrees at 2 knots. At 09:03:04 the aircraft passed the runway threshold at a height of 50 feet and the captain felt the airplane floated. The right hand main landing gear touched down softly at 09:03:14. Four seconds later the captain pulled the reverse levers. Almost at the same time, he felt some vibrations from the airframe like stall buffeting and thought that it was not a normal landing. Determining that the aircraft was still in the air, the captain decided to go around, shifting the thrust levers to TO/GA positions. The nose was raised sharply, reaching +12.7 degrees. The tail struck the runway, causing a 40 cm * 3 m gash and a distorted rear bulkhead. The airplane circled and landed safely at 09:27. There were no injuries among the 166 passengers and crew. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""In this accident, it is highly probable that when the Aircraft rejected the landing after touching Runway 27, its nose was raised sharply, causing the lower part of the rear fuselage to contact with the runway and be damaged.  It is highly probable that the substantial pitch-up moment caused the quick Aircraft nose-up with the following reasons: The captain decided to reject the landing under the circumstance where he could not recognize the touchdown of main landing gears due to the soft landing;  Balanced pitching moment was disrupted by the captainÂs nose-up elevator input as his go-around was initiated from the full-aft sidestick position.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JTSB Report number: AA2013-7 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: JTSB  Japan Today   Location  Images: photo (c) JTSB; Sendai Airport (SDJ/RJSS); February 2012 photo (c) JTSB; Sendai Airport (SDJ/RJSS) photo (c) JTSB; Sendai Airport (SDJ/RJSS) photo (c) JTSB; Sendai Airport (SDJ/RJSS) photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Nagoya-Komaki International Airport (NGO); October 1993 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were no injuries among the 142 passengers and six crew members. The aircraft was on a scheduled flight to London-Luton Airport (LTN), from Faro Airport (FAO) Portugal. The pilot flying (PF) was a captain-under-training, occupying the left seat; the right seat was occupied by a training captain, who was the commander of the aircraft.  The aircraft was given an early radar vector towards the final approach track to runway 26 and the PF increased the rate of descent to close the correct descent profile from above.  The aircraft was then allocated a heading of 220Â°M, cleared to intercept the localiser and, once established, to descend on the glidepath. The PF realised that the aircraft would be high and configured the aircraft with flap 2 and the landing gear down, to capture the 3Â° glideslope from above. He armed the localiser mode and then attempted to arm the approach mode but inadvertently selected the EXPED pushbutton. The expedite climb mode engaged but, to prevent a climb or any mode confusion and to regain the correct profile, the PF disconnected the autopilot and the autothrust. The aircraft passed through the localiser and ATC issued a revised heading to enable the aircraft to intercept from the south.  The PF decided to continue flying the approach manually and the aircraft was established on the localiser at 5.5 nm. It was configured for landing, with full flap, at 5 nm. Landing clearance was issued, with a reported surface wind of 320Â°/15 kt. A subsequent wind check of 320Â°/16 kt was broadcast three minutes before touchdown. The wind conditions were gusty and gave rise to some turbulence on the approach.  Stabilised approach criteria were met at 1,000 ft and 500 ft radio altitude (RA). The VAPP (final approach) speed was 129 kt and at 50 ft RA the approach remained stable. Just below 50 ft there was a small nose-up pitch input followed by two nose-down inputs and, below 50 ft, the flight data indicated an increasing rate of descent from about 600 fpm to about 850 fpm. The data also showed that, below 100 ft RA, there were some left and right roll control inputs.  Below 30 ft, over the runway, both pilots sensed that the aircraft was sinking rapidly and both initiated a TOGA 10 go-around. The PF momentarily retarded the thrust levers to idle before advancing them to the TOGA (Takeoff and Go-around) position. At the same time, he made a full forward sidestick input, within one second, which was then rapidly reversed to full aft sidestick. As the PF made the forward sidestick input, the commander initiated an aft sidestick input which reached the full aft position within one second.  He followed through the PF, pushing the thrust levers fully forward and announced ""I HAVE CONTROL"". The aircraft made firm contact with the runway at 2.99g and a 12.5 ft/sec rate of descent. It touched down on all three landing gear legs simultaneously, before lifting off and starting to climb. During this phase the PF relinquished control and reverted to the PNF role. The commander remained as the PF, completed the go-around and subsequently carried out an uneventful landing on the same runway. There were no reported injuries. CONCLUSION: ""Both pilots responded to an increased rate of descent approaching touchdown and each initiated a TOGA 10 go-around.  Their initial sidestick inputs were in opposition and, without the use of the takeover sidestick pushbutton, the net effect was a pitch-down control input.  If the commander had operated the sidestick takeover pushbutton, his nose-up pitch input would not have been counteracted by the nose-down input of the Capt U/T. In the event, his control input reduced the effect of the nose-down input made by the Capt U/T.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: EW/C2012/02/03 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were two pilots and no passengers on board. While returning to the airport, the crew advised air traffic control that they had a landing gear problem.  The crew conducted two fly-overs of the airport to allow maintenance engineers to observe the aircraft, and the engineers confirmed that the landing gear was still retracted. The crew decided to land the aircraft with the landing gear retracted, and a full emergency was declared.  The aircraft belly landed at 02:32.  Both pilots escaped unhurt. The ATSB found that an electrical wire to the landing gear selector valve had separated at a connector adjacent to its terminal preventing normal operation of the landing gear to the down position. The investigation also identified an out of rig condition in the landing gear emergency extension system, which prevented correct operation of that system. Factors including the maintenance practices by a number of personnel and inconsistent maintenance documentation contributed to the existence of the defects. Contributing factors â¢ The proximity of the landing gear selector valve electrical wiring loom to the external hydraulic power connectors within the left engine nacelle on Fairchild SA227-AT Metro aircraft resulted in the âdown selectionâ wire being damaged during routine maintenance activities [Safety issue]. â¢ The separation of the âdown selectionâ wire interrupted the supply of electrical power to the down solenoid, preventing extension of the landing gear in the normal operating mode. â¢ The maintenance practices by a number of personnel prior to the occurrence resulted in missed opportunities to identify an out of rig cable within the landing gear emergency extension system. â¢ The landing gear did not extend in the emergency extension mode in-flight due to the out of rig cable preventing correct actuation of the by-pass and shut-off valves. â¢ The flight crew were unable to extend the landing gear using the normal and emergency extension procedures, resulting in the need for a gear-up landing. Other factors that increased risk â¢ The manufacturerâs operational and maintenance documentation suite contained inconsistencies in some procedures. Other findings â¢ The crew conducted the emergency procedures to extend the landing gear in a manner that should have allowed the landing gear to extend. â¢ The low-level fly-past provided for independent confirmation that the landing gear was fully retracted and the gear doors closed.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ATSB Report number: AO-2012-024 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: http://www.atsb.gov.au/publications/investigation_reports/2012/aair/ao-2012-024.aspx  http://www.heraldsun.com.au/travel/news/light-plane-belly-flops-at-brisbane-airport-closing-main-runway-expect-delays/story-fn32891l-1226271375138 Images: Photo: ATSB Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates15-Feb-2012 03:36 harro Added 15-Feb-2012 03:40 harro Updated [Narrative, ]15-Feb-2012 04:01 RobertMB Updated [Aircraft type, Narrative, ]16-Feb-2012 09:49 harro Updated [Aircraft type, Narrative, ]31-Aug-2014 19:50 Aerossurance Updated [Narrative, ]29-Sep-2014 17:52 Aerossurance Updated [Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

There were no injuries to the 2 crewmembers onboard but the airplane sustained substantial damage. The flight was operating under 14 CFR Part 121 Supplemental as a cargo only flight from Anchorage, Alaska (KANC)Â to KILI.  The Captain reported that the flight from KANC had been uneventful.Â  The Captain reported that during the descent, while at about 250 knots airspeed with his hands on the controls and the autopilot engaged, the airplane pitched to about 20 degrees nose down. The captain reported he then disconnected the autopilot and adjusted the pitch trim while pulling back on the column to recover from the pitch excursion. The flight crew declared an emergency andÂ slowed the airplane to about 200 knots.Â  Approximately 5-10 miles from the airport, while in a slow left turn at 3000 feet msl altitude, the airplane pitched down a second time while the captain was hand flying.Â  Â As he recovered from the pitch down, he was lined up for a 5 mile final approach for runway 35. Â The captain elected to make a high speed, flaps up landing and landed uneventfully on runway 35. Post-flight inspection revealed that the left elevator was bent at the mid span trim tab, had partially detached from the aircraft, and was missing two attachment bolts. A review of the airplane maintenance history showed that while in ""A"" check maintenance, a dent was noted in the left elevator and the elevator was removed.Â  The maintenance team did not follow the EMB 120 maintenance manual procedure for removal of the left elevator.Â  During the non-routine maintenance procedures used by the maintenance team, cotter pin safeties that were removed from castellated nuts on the 2 outboard vertical hinge bolts on the left elevator were not reinstalled.Â The removal of these two bolts is not part of the EMB 120 maintenance manual procedure for removal of the left elevator.Â  The maintenance team did not document the non-routine procedure they used to remove and reinstall the left elevator.  The Require Inspection Items (RII)Â inspector had inspected theÂ elevator installationÂ for the procedures in the manual and was not aware of the undocumented non-routine maintenance procedures used, and hence did not examine the nuts that did not have the required cotter pins, which were not to be removed as part of the approved procedure. The FAA found that the maintenance teams that removed and reinstalled the elevator were inexperienced in EMB 120 elevator removal and reinstallation procedures. Probable Cause: the maintenance personnel's failure to install the cotter pins that secured castellated nuts on the left elevator vertical hinge bolts, which resulted in the left elevator partially detaching in flight. Contributing to the accident was the failure of maintenance personnel to document the non-routine maintenance procedure that was used to remove and reinstall the elevator during maintenance.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA12CA042 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 8 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA12CA042  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates04-Oct-2022 14:57 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

During the takeoff just prior to the aircraft becoming airborne, the Loadmaster, who was seated in the rear of the cargo compartment, heard an electrical buzzing sound and observed an orange jet-like flame shoot across the cargo ramp from left to right at floor level. He then unbuckled his harness and was reaching for the fire extinguisher when an expansive orange fireball erupted, causing him to protect his head with his jacket. Once the fireball receded, he proceeded forward and alerted the crew to the fire while calling for the takeoff to be aborted. Concurrently, the aircraft had just become airborne and reached 10 feet above the runway. With sufficient runway remaining, the Flying Pilot landed straight ahead and aggressively stopped the aircraft while the Non-Flying Pilot notified ATC. Once the engines were shut down, all nine crewmembers quickly egressed and moved upwind of the aircraft. Crash, Fire, and Rescue services responded and expeditiously extinguished the fire. The aircraft was extensively damaged and one crewmember received a minor injury during egress. Cause Factors: 1. The fire was ignited due to an electrical arcing event that occurred between the auxiliary hydraulic system pump motor power supply wire harness and a pressurized auxiliary hydraulic stainless steel braided flex hose installed as part of modification CF-378.  The stainless steel braided flex hose chafed through the electrical insulation of the wire and the subsequent electrical arcing from the wire resulted in a 2mm hole in the flex hose, leak of high pressure hydraulic fluid and ignition of the hydraulic fluid.  2. The CF-378 modification leaflet did not specify sufficient routing and clamping arrangements to maintain separation of the pressurized hydraulic lines from support structure and the hydraulic pump motor wire and the re-issued CF-378 modification leaflet was ambiguous as to the correct location of the test connection support bracket.  3. The approval process for the MPP was deficient in that it did not detect the improper location of the ground test connection bracket, did not adequately consider the effect of the redesign on routing and clamping, did not treat the revised configuration as a new modification, and did not specify the application of the MPP installed alternate parts in the amended parts list.  4. The modification approval process did not contain specific provisions to consider impacts of routing and clamping for wiring hoses IAW CFTOs C-17-010-002/ME-001, Aircraft Electrical and Electronic Wiring and for flexible hoses IAW CFTO C-12-010-040/TR-010, Part 3 Aircraft Flexible Hose Standard Manufacture, Replacement and Inspection.  5. Maintenance personnel and supervisors at all levels did not detect and/or correct deficiencies related to routing and clamping of lines and wires for modification CF-378 and the associated MPP, either during installation and/or subsequent inspections.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Canada DFS Report number: 1010-CC130342 (DFS 2-5) Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Photo of airframe stored at Abbotsford, jan 2014.

The pilot, the sole occupant, sustained fatal injuries. The airplane took off from runway 29 on a ferry flight to Manaus-Eduardo Gomes International Airport, AM (MAO). It failed to gain enough height on takeoff and collided with a pole. The airplane came down in a wooded area just off Avenida Torquato TapajÃ³s. Manaus-Aeroclube de Flores Airport, AM has a single, 860 m long asphalt runway. It appeared that the control locks were still in place and had not been removed during the preflight checks. Individual information a) Attitude - unspecified To assume all the responsibilities of flight (flight notification, removal from the aircraft, inspections, etc.) almost alone, the pilot showed overconfidence in his ability to perform such a task, possibly considering it ordinary and of low complexity. In addition, the company mechanic's participation in the preparation of the aircraft may have strengthened the confidence that the pre-flight items that may pass unnoticed would be performed by one technician. b) Memory - contributed The pilot forgot the control lock on the aircraft, which may have resulted from the rush to do the checklist, in which some items were not checked properly, as the existing lock model, which was less visible and was not approved for aeronautical purposes. c) Motivation - contributed The commander proved to be very motivated to make the supply flight quickly, so as not to impair the subsequent flight, which may have interfered with the completion of the checklist so that culminated in lock remaining in place. Information Psychosocial a) Team Dynamics - contributed Although the pilot relied on mechanical help in the preparation of the aircraft, the dynamic established by them did not guarantee the execution of the tasks efficiently and safely. Organizational Information a) Organizational culture - contributed The company since two years used a non-approved control lock and there was no standardization of the procedures of company manuals, which indicates that the fragile safety culture that reverberated in the accident. b) Support Systems - contributed The manuals of the company not clearly specified the activities that the mechanic should follow when preparing the aircraft, thus allowing gaps were created in the execution of the task. Concerning aircraft operation a) Cockpit coordination - contributed The pilot in command stopped using organizational resources available to him to accomplish the task to transfer the aircraft. The copilot had not arrived and the mechanic of the company was not among its duties to perform the complete pre-flight aircraft. Thus, the commander had to perform various tasks in a relatively short time and, therefore, failed to comply with an important item in the checklist that was removal of the lock of flight controls. b) Pilot forgetfulness - contributed The pilot forgot to remove the control lock during inspections (internal and external). Also forgot to perform the checklist of items relating to freedom of controls (aileron and elevator), during taxi the aircraft. The realization of these checks during pre-flight or even in the taxi the aircraft would have avoided the takeoff and, therefore, the accident. c) Managerial supervision - contributed Inadequate supervision of maintenance management allowed the aircraft involved in the accident to possess control locks not certified as an aeronautical product. d) Non-standard procedure - contributed The pilot, possibly due to the rush to perform takeoff, failed to meet a number of items set out in checklist that, if realized, would alert the commands that the lock had not been removed. This item can be considered as the last barrier to prevent the accident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CENIPA Report number: A-626/CENIPA/2014 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Folha  D24am   Location  Images: photo (c) Ulrich F.Hoppe; Manaus; 05 August 2011 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The descent and initial stages of the approach were conducted in night visual meteorological conditions in light rainfall. The flight crew recalled seeing heavy rainfall close to the threshold of runway 29 during the approach. They requested further information about the weather from Air Traffic Control (ATC) and were informed that there was a storm at the threshold of runway 29, extending to the east. The flight crew asked ATC for the reported wind at the aerodrome and were told it was indicating 360Â° 5 kts at the western side of the field and downwind at 5 kts at the threshold. The crew briefed the possibility of a missed approach if the conditions deteriorated. Approaching the runway, the rain increased and the First Officer requested the wipers be selected to high. The flight crew noted an increased sink rate and at 55 ft above ground level (AGL), the thrust levers were set to maximum continuous thrust to arrest the descent rate. At 34 ft, engine thrust was set to idle. As the aircraft entered the flare the rain intensified, significantly reducing visibility. The aircraft landed heavily, recording 2.71 G on touchdown. The tower enquired about the landing conditions and the flight crew reported heavy rain and marginal conditions. This required a hard landing inspection to be conducted prior to further flight. An engineering inspection was conducted in Darwin and a crack in the No. 1 engine rear attachment bolt retainer was found. However, the link between this crack and the hard landing could not be established. A number of components from both main landing gears were also to be replaced as they may have exceeded their design limit.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ATSB Report number: AO-2012-036 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: https://www.atsb.gov.au/sites/default/files/media/3925181/AB2012088.pdf History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  21 November 2016 9H-TQM Hi Fly Malta 0 Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS/EHAM) min Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates30-May-2024 17:17 ASN Added 30-May-2024 17:19 ASN Updated [Time, Location, Accident report, ]30-May-2024 17:19 ASN Updated Corrections or additions? ...

There were no injuries. Flight NM309 had departed Leeds/Bradford Airport (LBA), UK on a flight to Ronaldsway Airport (IOM). The flight had been routine and the crew were flying a day, visual approach to runway 26, in good weather, with the surface wind reported as 210Â° at 14 kt. The commander was the pilot flying (PF) and the co-pilot, who had recently joined the company, was nearing the end of his line training on type.  The approach was flown with full flap and the gear locked and confirmed down by the three green gear indicators. The landing weight was estimated to be 13,448 lb (6,099 kg) and the crew recalled that the Vref was about 105 kt.  Almost immediately the aircraft touched down it leaned to the right and there was an unusual noise. The commander levelled the aircraft with a left roll input.  However, as the speed decayed the lean increased and it became apparent that there was a problem with the right gear. The commander continued to apply left aileron and rudder. Both pilots recognised that the aircraft was likely to leave the paved surface and so the co-pilot held the control wheel and rudder to allow the commander to apply nosewheel steering and operate the feather levers. The left engine was shut down and feathered as the aircraft departed the runway. The right engine was also shut down but its propeller did not feather as the mechanism appears to have been damaged when the blades contacted the runway. The aircraft left the paved surface, yawed to the right and slid sideways before it came to a stop 90Â° to the runway heading. The right landing gear failed as a result of intergranular corrosion / stress corrosion cracking of the forward yoke pintle. This same aircraft (Jetstream 31 msn 785) suffered a failure of the left hand main landing gear while landing at Doncaster/Sheffield-Robin Hood Airport (DCA), U.K., August 15, 2014.

All five on board were killed.  The flight departed Harstad-Narvik-Evenes Airport (EVE) at 13:41 on a flight to Kiruna Airport (KRN). It was part of a three ship formation in the exercise Cold Response 2012 where three aircraft were to fly to Kiruna to pick up personnel and gear. A German Air Force Transall C-160 had taken off at 13:30 and arrived at Kiruna as planned. Last radio contact with C-130J 5630 was at 14:43 with Kiruna Tower and radar contact was lost at 14:56.  Search operations are hampered by cloud cover and poor visibility due to strong winds. The wreckage was finally located on March 17, at 08:30. Debris was scattered on the side of a glacier. The investigation into the cause of the accident showed a.o. that the GPWS/TAWS system operated in 'Tactical' mode and thus did not provide warnings to the crew about the terrain. Also, the airplane operated outside Swedish radar coverage Causes The accident was caused by the crew on HAZE 01 not noticing to the shortcomings in the clearances issued by the air traffic controllers and to the risks of following these clearances, which resulted in the aircraft coming to leave controlled airspace and be flown at an altitude that was lower than the surrounding terrain. The accident was rendered possible by the following organisational shortcomings in safety: - The Norwegian Air Force has not ensured that the crews have had sufficiently safe working methods for preventing the aircraft from being flown below the minimum safe flight level on the route. - LFV has not had sufficiently safe working methods for ensuring, partly, that clearances are only issued within controlled airspace during flight under IFR unless the pilot specifically requests otherwise and, partly, that relevant flight information is provided.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: SHK Report number: Report RM 2013:02 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Aftonbladet  VG.no  SjÃ¶fartsverket  AP   Location  Images: photo (c) Forsvarets mediesenter  /  Forsvarets spesialstyrker / FSK HJK MJK; Mount Kebnekaise; 17 March 2012 photo (c) Forsvarets mediesenter  /  Luftforsvaret; Mount Kebnekaise; 17 March 2012 photo (c) SHK; 2012 photo (c) SHK; 2012 photo (c) SHK; 2012 photo (c) Tom Svendsen; Oslo-Gardermoen Airport (OSL/ENGM); 15 September 2010 photo (c) Tom Svendsen; Oslo-Gardermoen Airport (OSL/ENGM); 15 September 2010 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

Both pilots were killed. The airplane took off from runway 10 at San Juan-Luis MuÃ±oz MarÃ­n International Airport bound for Sint Maarten-Juliana Airport (SXM). It carried 12100 pounds of cargo mainly consisting of bread. Shortly after takeoff the captain declared an emergency, stating that they wanted to return to the airport. They reported smoke coming from one of the engines. Air traffic control cleared the flight to land on runway 10, but the crew requested runway 28 for landing. This was approved and the controller cleared N153JR to land, stating that the wind was ""150 at 3"". The flight came down in the Torrecilla Lagoon on the east side of the airport. It sank in 30-50 feet of water. Investigation showed that the estimated ramp weight of the airplane was 47,710 lbs. The Convair CV-440Âs maximum allowable takeoff weight of 48,000 lbs requires use of both the antidetonation injection and autofeather systems; however, because neither system was used on the accident flight, the maximum allowable takeoff weight was 40,900 lbs. Flight crew injuries were consistent with the first officer flying the airplane at the time of impact; however, considering the first officerÂs limited recent experience in the Convair CV-440 and the performance deficiencies identified in his training and certification history, he was likely not capable of handling the emergency without help from the captain. The captain on the other hand was likely suffering from acute sleep loss at the time of the accident, which would have negatively affected his ability to guide the first officer in properly handling the emergency. Probable Cause: ""The flight crew's failure to maintain adequate airspeed after shutting down the right engine due to an in-flight fire in one of the right augmentors.

The aircraft sustained substantial damage.  The occurrence flight was chartered by a travel agency on behalf of a wilderness adventure ski lodge. It was a regularly occurring charter flight between Vancouver and Blue River, BC, Canada. The travel agent verbally passed weather information to the flight crew. The captain understood that the runway had been plowed the previous day, and that the weather had been good that morning in Blue River. Before departing Vancouver, the flight crew had also obtained official weather data from regular flight planning sources. It was noted that although current conditions at Blue River were good, a weather system was moving northbound, and conditions in the area of Kelowna, Kamloops (CYKA) (the alternate), and Blue River would begin to deteriorate. As the flight progressed, the ski lodge radio room operator overheard the flight crew discussing weather conditions with a local helicopter pilot on the ATF as the flight overflew Blue River, but the operator did not have any direct contact with the flight. The crew was satisfied with the information received from the helicopter pilot regarding local weather. Because the Blue River aerodrome does not have a published instrument approach procedure, the intention was to fly over the aerodrome and proceed under visual flight rules (VFR) into the aerodrome. The flight progressed as planned until the aircraft passed overhead Blue River at the lowest useable IFR altitude, and the pilot was not able to descend under VFR into Blue River. The pilot then climbed back up to an enroute IFR altitude and continued to Valemount Airport under IFR. After conducting the IFR approach into Valemount and finding the weather suitable for flight under VFR, the aircraft completed the 60-nautical mile (nm) trip back to Blue River visually. The aircraft slowly descended in steps as it flew south towards Blue River at a reduced cruise speed of approximately 175 knots. As the aircraft neared the aerodrome, the pilots descended to altitudes as low as 1100 feet above ground level (agl) to maintain visual contact with the ground in deteriorating weather. Approximately 4 nm from the aerodrome, and 85 seconds before touchdown, control was transferred from the first officer (FO) to the captain, who became the pilot flying (PF). During the approach, the crew rushed to complete the pre-landing checks, visually acquire the runway, and manoeuvre the aircraft to land. The captain turned slightly to the left, away from the runway centreline. At this point, the FO called visual contact with the runway, and the captain turned right, back towards the runway centreline, and again passed through the runway centreline. The captain did not acknowledge that the runway was in sight. The aircraft was configured for landing 25 seconds prior to touchdown. As viewed from the pilot's perspective, the aircraft was to the left of centreline. Several seconds later, the aircraft initiated a right turn to line up with the centreline of runway 19, but actually crossed to the right of the centreline. The aircraft then overflew several buildings on the right of the runway centreline, approximately 75 feet adjacent to the runway threshold. The aircraft then turned sharply to the left as it passed abeam the threshold, then sharply right to acquire the centreline before touching down approximately 2000 feet past the threshold. Immediately after touchdown, the aircraft veered left into the snow bank. During the last 23 seconds of the flight, the FO broadcast a traffic advisory to indicate that the aircraft was on final, made 3 speed calls, and advised the captain that the runway was to the left. There were no remarks made by the captain since the request for the landing checklist. The FO did not declare an unstable approach, or prompt the captain to execute a missed approach. Findings as to causes and contributing factors: 1. Although the hazardous runway condition had been identified by the company's safety management system, the delay in action to mark the runway allowed this condition to persist. 2. Up-to-date weather and runway condition information was not provided to the crew, nor was it requested by the crew. 3. The pilot continued the approach below the visibility limits specified in the company's standard operating procedures. 4. Deteriorating weather, as well as the lack of approach aids and runway markings, hampered the pilot's ability to establish the aircraft onto a stable final approach prior to crossing the threshold. 5. The company's standard operating procedures for stabilized approaches were not followed, and an unstabilized approach was allowed to continue. 6. The pilot was unable to position the aircraft over the centre of the runway as it settled to land, and the left main landing gear entered the deeper snow at the runway edge, causing the aircraft to veer into the snow bank. Findings as to risk: 1. If a company's risk mitigation strategy is not implemented in a timely manner, hazards are allowed to persist, increasing the risk of an accident. 2. If company standard operating procedures do not include criteria and procedures for stabilized approaches, or they are not followed, there is an increased risk of landing accidents. 3. Operating on a snow-covered runway that does not have markings or devices to allow a pilot to easily identify the runway surface increases the risk of runway excursions. 4. If the identified risks and mitigation strategies are not communicated to the people exposed to the risks, it is possible they will deem the risk as acceptable to management and continue operations.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A12P0034 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) TSB; Blue River Airport, BC; March 2012 photo (c) TSB; Blue River Airport, BC; March 2012 photo (c) TSB; Blue River Airport, BC; 17 March 2012 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

None of the 296 passengers and 12 crew were injured. The captain on the flight was Pilot Monitoring, the co-pilot was Pilot Flying. The en route and descent parts of the flight were uneventful. The right main landing gear touched down at about 610 m from the runway 34L threshold with a pitch angle of 3.3 degrees and vertical acceleration of 1.27 G. After that, the captain gave large pitch-up and pitch-down control inputs to assist the control of the copilot, and the vertical acceleration of the aircraft fluctuated significantly twice. Due to these changes in vertical acceleration, the captain felt that the aircraft had bounced and was floating, although this was not the case. At this time the speed brakes had activated and the reverse thrust was being applied, but the captain did not notice this. The captain diverted his attention to look outside of the aircraft to confirm its attitude, and then judged to make a go-around. When he noticed that the reversers had been activated, he still decided to continue the go around, although the AOM calls for a full stop landing when reversers have been activated. The captain called for a go around three times but the TO/GA switch could not be activated by the co-pilot because the reversers were selected. The captain then called ""I have control"" and took over controls. All the time the airplane had been rolling on the runway in a nose up attitude, causing a tailstrike. The go around was continued and the airplane landed safely at 16:35. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""In this accident, it is highly probable that the Aircraft continued rolling with the pitch-up attitude after touchdown, causing the aft fuselage to come into contact with the runway and be damaged. It is highly probable that the Aircraft continued rolling with the pitch-up attitude due to the following reasons: after touchdown, the PIC had felt that the Aircraft had bounced to the extent necessary for go-around, and judged to make go-around to avoid a hard landing; even after he became aware that the reverse thrust levers had been raised, he continued go-around; hence, it took time for the engine thrust to increase and he continued to pull his control column. Moreover, it is somewhat likely that, in a situation in which the PIC had been assisting the control of the FO, and without the PICÂs declaring a takeover, the intention of the PIC was not properly conveyed to the FO, the sharing of duties between PF and PM became momentarily unclear, and the monitoring of flight information such as pitch angle and speed, which was the duty of PM, was not performed adequately.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JTSB Report number: AA2014-8 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Flight 120 took off from Tyumen Airport runway 21 on a regular domestic passenger flight to Surgut (SGC). The ATR-72 climbed to a height of 210 m and then banked 35Â° left, followed by a 50Â° right hand bank. It then struck a snowy field approx. 1,6 km past the end of the runway, broke up and a fire erupted. The Interstate Aviation Committee stated that both engines were working properly at the time of the accident.  The Federal Air Transport Agency reported that the airplane had been parked outside for eight hours in weather conditions which included snow and temperatures at and just below freezing level. The airplane was not de-iced prior to departure and the crew did not insist on being de-iced. Causes: The immediate cause of the ATR 72-201 VP-BYZ aircraft accident was the PIC's decision to takeoff without de/anti-icing treatment despite the fact that snow and ice deposits were present on aircraft surface and were discovered by the crew members during taxi which resulted in degradation of aircraft aerodynamic performance and stall during climbing after takeoff as well as inability of the crew to recognize stall and, consequently, failure to undertake recovery procedure. The aircraft stall occurred at the operational angles of attack right after flaps retraction with engaged autopilot before stall warning system activation and was caused by the loss of the wing lift effectiveness due to takeoff with non-removed ground icing. The system cause of the accident were shortcomings in ground handling activities and staff training in UTAir-Technik that became possible because of absence of due monitoring by the Technical and Operation Supervising Directorates of UTAir airline for compliance with airline requirements regarding ground handling and aircraft ground icing protection which resulted in erroneous evaluation of aircraft conditions by the PIC and aircraft mechanic (the shift head kept himself aloof from monitoring mechanic's activities) after the aircraft has been on ground in icing conditions for a long time and in release the aircraft to fly without de/anti-icing treatment. The contributing factors were: - The shortcomings in the UTAir safety management system, which contains, all in all, general issues only and is not adopted for the implementation of Airline activities in particular areas, which did not allow to reveal and correct existing safety risks in a timely manner. - The shortcomings in the UTAir-Technic quality management system, resulted in neglecting of certain requirements of the UTAir ground handling management manual regarding staff training and monitoring for aircraft de/anti-icing treatment which led to the situation when not sufficiently-qualified staff performed the evaluation of the aircraft surface conditions and made the decision on need for the aircraft to be de-iced/anti-iced. - The absence at the time of the accident of basic regulations in force that establish state requirements for ground handling (de/anti-icing treatment in particular) including staff training and organization licensing. - The shortcomings in crewmembers initial and recurrent training as far as the danger of ground icing, its influence on the aircraft aerodynamic performance together with aircraft anti-icing system operation features and design are concerned that did not allow the crew to make the only appropriate decision to return for de-icing/anti-icing treatment after the observation of the snow and ice contamination on the wing after anti-icing system activation in de-icing mode while taxiing for takeoff. - The methodological imperfection of the crew computer based and simulator training programs concerning the prevention of aircraft stall, identification of approach to stall and taking timely actions for recovery. - The increasing need for number of flight crews to perform highly growing flights schedule which, with ineffective SMS, resulted in flight instructor work deficiencies during PIC training and absence of PIC skills to take correct decisions and to strictly comply with the regulations in force. - The possible fatigue of the crew members due to the violation of the work and rest balance while performing split flight shifts together with a large number of unused days-off.METAR: 01:30 UTC / 07:30 local time: USTR 020130Z 24006G09MPS 9999 BKN013CB M01/M01 Q1002 TEMPO 26015MPS 1500 SHSN BLSN BKN005 RMK QFE742/0989 21290060 30750029Wind 6 m/s (gusting to 9 m/s) at 240 degrees; Visibility: 10 km or more; Clouds: Broken, at 1300 feet above aerodrome level, cumulonimbus; Temperature: -01 degrees Celsius; Dewpoint: -01 degrees Celsius; QNH (Sea-level pressure): 1002 hPa; The following weather phenomena are expected to arise temporarily: Wind: 260 degrees, Speed: 15 m/s; Visibility: 1500 m; Weather: Showers of Snow; Clouds: Broken sky, at 500 feet above aerodrome level; Runway state: Runway 21: wet or water patches, contamination 51% to 100%, deposit less than 1 mm deep, friction coefficient 0.60Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: MAK  UTAir  SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) State Ministry of Emergency Situations of Russia in the Tyumen region; near Tyumen Airport (TJM/USTR); 02 April 2012 photo (c) State Ministry of Emergency Situations of Russia in the Tyumen region; near Tyumen Airport (TJM/USTR); 02 April 2012 photo (c) State Ministry of Emergency Situations of Russia in the Tyumen region; near Tyumen Airport (TJM/USTR); 02 April 2012 photo (c) MAK; near Tyumen Airport (TJM/USTR); 02 April 2012 photo (c) MAK; near Tyumen Airport (TJM/USTR); 02 April 2012 photo (c) MAK; near Tyumen Airport (TJM/USTR); 02 April 2012 photo (c) MAK photo (c) MAK photo (c) MAK photo (c) MAK photo (c) MAK photo (c) Konstantin Nikiforov; October 2009 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates19-Oct-2024 18:56 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

In accordance with abnormal procedures checklists, and guidance from the company, the crew elected to use the Alternate Landing Gear Extension checklist to prepare for landing at the destination After pulling the main gear release handle and the nose gear release handle the crew observed that the main landing gear indicated down and locked with green indicator lights, the nose landing gear did not indicate down and locked, and the red Nose Gear Unsafe light was illuminated.  The crew landed the airplane with the main landing gear down and the nose landing gear retracted, and the airplane came to rest on the main gear and forward fuselage on the runway. Post-accident, the nose gear was successfully extended multiple times using the alternate extension handle and the landing gear was also extended multiple times under hydraulic power with no anomalies noted.  Testing of landing gear system components did not reveal any failures that should have prevented the gear from extending via the alternate extension method.  The pull force required to extend the nose gear alternate release handle to a position where the nose gear released from the up and locked position was measured at approximately 72 lbs. According to manufacturer's design requirements, the pull length on the alternate release handle should be approximately 11 inches with a force of 90 pounds. A post-accident review of the alternate gear extension procedures was conducted in a full flight simulator by the investigation group with the participation of the accident flight crew.  The pull force required and the pull length required to extend the nose gear using the alternate extension handle was determined to be significantly lower in the flight simulator as compared to the aircraft. There was no guidance contained in the alternate landing gear extension procedure specifying required pull forces when using the alternate extension handle. Subsequent to the accident, the manufacturer added details to the alternate landing gear extension procedure in the Airplane Flight Manual regarding the maximum pull forces that a pilot may experience when the alternate extension handle is pulled. Probable Cause: the nose landing gear alternate release handle was not pulled with sufficient enough force or distance to release the uplocks and allow extension of the nose landing gear. Contributing to the accident was the dissimilar pull force and pull length set on the flight simulator that was used for flight crew training of alternate landing gear extension procedures and the lack of information available to crew members advising of the dissimilar pull force.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA12FA058 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  4 July 2012 N213WQ United Express, opb Colgan Air 0 Houston-George Bush Intercontinental Airport, TX (IAH) sub Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates03-Apr-2014 16:09 Katonk2014 Added 21-Dec-2016 19:28 ASN Update Bot Updated [Time, Damage, Category, Investigating agency, ]27-Nov-2017 20:37 ASN Update Bot Updated [Operator, Other fatalities, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

They were then scheduled to return, with passengers, to London-Gatwick Airport (LGW). An onboard hand-held Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) HP iPAQ computer was used to calculate the takeoff performance data. Once this was completed, the EFB was placed in the standby mode. The flight to Chambery was uneventful and the aircraft landed at 09:15, 15 minutes behind schedule. The return flight to Gatwick was scheduled to depart at 10:00. The pre-flight preparations proceeded normally and the pilots reported no distractions other than those normally experienced during a turnaround. The co-pilot, who was the non-handling pilot for this flight, completed the manual load sheet whilst the commander programmed the route into the Flight Management Computer (FMC). The commander reported that he then cross-checked the load sheet information and, having ensured it was correct, entered the Zero Fuel Weight (ZFW) into the FMC. The FMC then calculated the Takeoff Weight (TOW) using the fuel weight automatically retained in the system. The commander read back the FMC calculated TOW to the co-pilot, who cross-checked it against the load sheet data and confirmed that they agreed. Having loaded the ZFW into the FMC and cross-checked the TOW, the commander used the EFB computer to calculate the takeoff performance data. This involved waking up the EFB from the standby mode, then entering the airfield, weather and aircraft data, which included the flap position for takeoff. A specific flap setting could be entered, or the computer could be used to provide an optimum setting. The commander stated that he normally entered Flap 5 for the takeoff performance calculation. However, at airports where performance was considered to be more critical, he would set the performance computer to select the optimum setting. As the runway at Chambery is relatively short, the commander chose the optimum flap position calculated by the performance computer. This gave a selection of Flap 1 which, under the circumstances, he did not consider unusual. Similarly, the computed takeoff speeds did not seem unusual to the commander, particularly as they were predicated on a flap setting he did not normally use. The computed figures, based on the data entered on the EFB, allowed for a reduced thrust takeoff. The calculated assumed temperature to be set to achieve this did not seem unreasonable at the time, although the commander stated that, in hindsight, he considered it to be too high for the airfield and the prevailing conditions. Both pilots stated that they would normally cross-check the performance figures once they had been calculated on the EFB. However, on this occasion, and for reasons the pilots could not recall, this was not done. The commander wrote the speeds he had computed using the EFB on the flight paperwork and then entered them into the FMC, overwriting the FMC generated speeds. The commander stated that this was standard practice and on this occasion he did not take note of any difference between the two sets of speeds. The rest of the pre-flight preparation was completed and the aircraft took off from runway 36 at Chambery at 10:08 UTC (12:08 local time), on schedule, with 131 passengers onboard. The pilots reported the weather at the time was good, with a light wind from the east, good visibility and dry conditions. The ATIS reported a temperature of 8Â°C and a QNH of 999 hPa. On takeoff both pilots felt a slight judder, which they considered was due to turbulence from the preceding aircraft. Early in the climb they received a call on the intercom from the rear cabin station informing them that the cabin crew to the rear of the aircraft had also felt a judder. This call was intended for the cabin purser at the front of the cabin, but was mistakenly made to the flight deck. The pilots reassured the cabin crew member, still believing the judder was due to turbulence. Their opinion was reinforced by the absence of any abnormal flight deck indications or calls from ATC at Chambery to the contrary. The remainder of the flight went without incident and the aircraft landed at Gatwick at 11:30. The aircraft was taxied to stand and, after shutting down, the pilots were informed by ground personnel that the underside of the rear fuselage had sustained damage consistent with a tailstrike. This prompted the crew to reconsider the cause of the judder felt at takeoff and they reviewed the takeoff performance data. This revealed that the commander had omitted to enter the aircraft's TOW into the EFB computer at Chambery, with the result that the computer had reverted to the previous TOW data retained from Stansted to calculate the takeoff performance figures.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: AAIB Bulletin: 4/2013 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 12 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) AAIB; London-Gatwick Airport (LGW/EGKK); April 2012 photo (c) AAIB Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Of the 98 passengers and crew onboard, two flight attendants received serious injuries and one passenger received minor injuries during the encounter. The flight was operating under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 as a regularly scheduled passenger flight between Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (KPHX), Phoenix, Arizona, and Denver International Airport (KDEN), Denver, Colorado. According to the operator, the captain was the pilot monitoring, and the first officer (FO) was the pilot flying. The flight was cleared to descend from FL390 to 17,000 feet. The seatbelt sign was on during the descent and there were no pilot reports of turbulence in the area.   The captain turned on the weather radar and noted no returns present between the airplane and the airport. As the airplane passed through about FL320, the captain noticed the airspeed rapidly increasing.  He disconnected the autopilot while simultaneously notifying the FO of the overspeed and began to apply a nose-up input. The FO also began to command a nose-up input at that time and so the captain released his pitch up input. The crew received an overspeed warning and then encountered severe turbulence. The flight crew stated the encounter lasted about 10 â 15 seconds. After the encounter, both Elevator and Aileron Computers (ELAC) faults were displayed. The FO resumed pilot flying duties while the Captain performed the appropriate actions to reset ELAC 1 and 2, report the encounter to air traffic control and dispatch, and contacted the flight attendants.  The A flight attendant (A-FA) was in the forward jumpseat and the B flight attendant (B-FA) and C flight attendant (C-FA) were in the aft galley sitting in their jumpseats without their seatbelts on. During the turbulence encounter, both aft flight attendants struck the overhead ceiling,  panels before landing on the floor. Two passengers who were also not wearing their seatbelts were lifted out of their seats and struck the ceiling panels during the encounter. Oxygen masks in several rows of seats were also released as a result of the turbulence. Two onboard medical personnel tended to the B-FA and C-FA with the assistance of the A-FA.   The captain declared a medical emergency and arranged for emergency personnel to meet the flight on arrival. At the gate, paramedics transported the two injured flight attendants and one of the injured passengers to the hospital.

It was climbing through an altitude of about FL220 when the crew decided to return to LGW. The emergency return was initiated because of a report of smoke in the cabin. The airplane was evacuated on the runway. First report of the cause of the incident reports technical problem caused a spurious fire warning. There was no fire & no smoke on board.  According to the summary if the incident from the AAIB:  ""The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) was notified of this occurrence by Virgin Atlantic Airways shortly after it happened and the investigation was started the same day. The occurrence was initially classified by the AAIB as a Serious Incident. However, when it became clear that two passengers had incurred injuries defined as Serious, the occurrence was reclassified as an Accident, in accordance with ICAO Annex 13 and the United Kingdomâs âCivil Aviation (Investigation of Air Accidents and Incidents) Regulations 1996â. This classification as an Accident does not reflect the state of the aircraft, which sustained only very minor damage, during the evacuation. In accordance with established international arrangements, the Bureau dâEnquÃªtes et dâAnalyses (BEA) in France, representing the State of Design and Manufacture of the aircraft, appointed an Accredited Representative and was supported by a team which included advisors from Airbus, the aircraft manufacturer, and Siemens, systems manufacturer. The aircraft operator has co-operated with the investigation and provided expertise as required. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) have been kept informed of developments. The aircraft was operating a flight from London Gatwick Airport to McCoy International Airport in Orlando, USA with three flight crew, 10 cabin crew and 304 passengers on board including three infants. Early in the flight the crew received a series of smoke warnings from the aft cargo hold and the commander elected to return to London Gatwick. The crew carried out the appropriate emergency drills, including the discharge of the fire extinguishers in the aft cargo hold, but the smoke warnings continued. The aircraft landed safely, the crew brought it to a halt on the runway and endeavoured to establish the extent of any fire. This produced conflicting evidence and, with smoke warnings continuing, the commander ordered an emergency evacuation. The passengers all left the aircraft within 90 seconds but two injuries, classed as âSeriousâ, were incurred. Subsequent examination of the aircraft and its systems showed that the smoke warnings had been spurious. The investigation identified that injuries were sustained during the evacuation of the aircraft. The evacuation was initiated based on the commanderâs assessment of the available sources of information, including the repetitive and intermittent nature of the aft cargo smoke warnings. The investigation identified the following causal factor for the intermittent cargo smoke warnings: A latent fault on the T1 thermistor channel of smoke detector 10WH, in combination with a CAN Bus fault and possible high levels of humidity in the cargo compartment due to the carriage of perishable goods, provided circumstances sufficient to generate multiple spurious aft cargo compartment smoke warnings. The investigation identified the following contributory factors for the intermittent cargo smoke warnings: The thermal channel fault in 10WH was not detected prior to the event by the internal smoke detector temperature monitoring. The proximity of the fire extinguisher nozzles to the smoke detectors"".

Bhoja Airlines flight B4213 departed Karachi (KHI) at 17:05 on a domestic flight to Islamabad (ISB). This was the inaugural evening flight for the airline on this route. The flight climbed to a cruising altitude of FL310 and continued towards Islamabad. Weather at the destination was poor due to a passing thunderstorm. At 18:19 the captain at a distance observed the squall line. Moments later the flight was cleared to descend to FL200. During the descent the captain and first officer discussed the weather. They were worried about the severity of the thunderstorm ahead. At 18:26 the first officer contacted Islamabad Approach and received clearance for the One Foxtrot arrival for an ILS approach to runway 30. After receiving further descent clearance the first officer discussed opportunities to approach the airfield through a gap in the squall line. The Approach controller gave radar vectors and descent instructions to fly through the gap in the storm. At 18:35, Islamabad Approach gave a weather update and said ""Bhoja 213 surface wind at Islamabad ah is varying between 180Â° to 270Â°, 10 kts and ah sometimes gusting to 20 kts and runway condition is wet, light drizzle is ah uhm going on, braking action not known"". Two minutes later the airplane entered the squall line. Although the Bhoja Air Operational Manual prohibited flight in these conditions, the captain decided to continue. The airplane was configured for the approach with flaps and slats selected and the undercarriage was down. The first officer then reported the speed to be 220 knots, which was 30 knots higher than the recommended speed. The captain reacted surprised as he did not expect this because the he was flying with the auto-throttle engaged. Likely the increase in speed was a result of windshear. The aircraft then entered the active weather cell with precipitation continuing in varying intensity. At 18:39 the airplane captured the ILS and descended on the glide slope. At this point the aircraft should have been in landing configuration with flaps at 30Â°. However, only flaps 5 were selected.  The aircraft then encountered an increasing downdraft. The pitch attitude increased and computed airspeed decreased as the autopilot attempted to maintain the glide slope. The GPWS consequently sounded with the aural alarm: ""Wind shear - Wind shear - Wind shear"". Although the first officer anxiously called for a go around, no action was taken. The downdraft dissipated and the pitch attitude decreased but the aircraft deviated left of the extended runway centerline, and was brought back by the captain. At that moment the autopilot disconnected due to the aircraft deviation beyond the autopilot maximum authority limits. The auto throttle remained engaged in IAS speed mode. Following autopilot disconnect, there was no control wheel activity recorded for approximately 6 seconds and no control column activity for approximately 8 seconds. The crew were likely confused. During this period of control inactivity, the aircraft deviated below the glide slope.  Then the Terrain Awareness Warning System (TAWS) alarm sounded: ""Whoop, Whoop, Whoop"". No action was taken by either crew member. A few seconds later the aircraft entered another downdraft and the rate of descent increased rapidly. The TAWS alarm sounded again, directing the crew to ""pull up"". The captain responded with a nose-up column input. However, pressure altitude and thrust continued to decrease. The downdraft dissipated rapidly, resulting in a rapid increase in angle of attack of the aircraft, which activated the stick shaker for almost 2 seconds. It appeared that captain lowered the nose down to get out of stick shaker regime however, proper and complete Boeing recommended stall and recovery procedures were not carried out. This resulted in a 12Â° nose down pitch. Then another windshear alarm sounded, followed by another stick shaker activation. The first officer shouted to ""get out"" and ""go around"" but the attempts by the captain failed as he did not apply the proper procedures to execute a go around. Shortly after initial ground contact, the aircraft struck a steeply sloped terrace about 5 meters high which resulted in significant structural breakup of the aircraft structure. The ineffective automated flight deck management in extreme adverse weather conditions by cockpit crew caused the accident. The ineffective automated flight deck management was due to various factors including; incorrect selection of cockpit crew on account of their inadequate flying experience, training and competence level for Boeing 737-236A (advanced version of Boeing 737-200 series), absence of formal simulator training in respect of FO for handling an automated flight deck, non-existence of cockpit crew professional competence / skill level monitoring system at operator level (Bhoja Air). The cockpit crew incorrect decision to continue the flight for destination and non-adherence to Boeing recommended QRH and FCOM remedial actions /procedures due to non-availability of customized aircraft documents (at Bhoja Air) for Boeing 737-236A (advanced version of Boeing 737-200 series) contributed towards the causation of accident. The inability of CAA Pakistan to ensure automated flight deck variance type training and monitoring requirements primarily due to incorrect information provided by the Bhoja Air Management was also a contributory factor in causation of the accident.METAR: 13:00 UTC / 18:00 local time: OPRN 201300Z 23020KT 4000 TS FEW025CB SCT030 BKN100 25/15 Q1009.3/29.8014:00 UTC / 19:00 local time: OPRN 201400Z 23020KT 3000 TSRA FEW025CB SCT030 BKN100 20/16 Q1011.0/29.85Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: PakCAA Report number: SIB-350 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) Timo Blossfeld; Johannesburg-O.R.

The takeoff was commenced from about the middle of the 768 meters long runway, with 348 meters remaining. This was a normal procedure on this airstrip. During the 16th flight of the day, the aircraft did not lift off the airstrip at the usual point. Continuing to take off, the aircraft used the entire length of the distance of the runway. The captain of the plane continued, but after running another 50-80 meters, and making sure that the takeoff was impossible, he rejected the takeoff. The plane began to sink into the ground with the subsequent nose over. According to the findings of the commission of inquiry, the cause of the accident was a coincidence of the following factors:  - failure of the crew to use the full length of the airstrip during the takeoff of the aircraft;  - late decision of the aircraft commander to stop take-off during the rolling of the aircraft outside the runway;  - change of wind direction to the opposite (tailwind) during the takeoff of the aircraftSources: State Aviation Service of Ukraine Accident Analysis 2012  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane touched down smoothly on the main landing gear (MLG) and then touched down on the nose landing gear (NLG). The PIC had his hand on the thrust reversers when he and the SIC heard the landing gear unsafe horn; the left MLG then collapsed followed immediately by the collapse of the right MLG and the NLG. The airplane slid on its belly for about 1,500 ft before it came to rest on the runway. Cockpit voice recorder data confirmed that the unsafe landing gear configuration warning did not occur before touchdown as reported by the PIC.    Postaccident examination revealed that, although the landing gear handle was in the down-and-locked position, all of the landing gear were fully retracted and engaged in their respective uplocks. Extensive testing of the airplane's hydraulic and electrical systems did not reveal any malfunctions that would have resulted in an uncommanded gear retraction. Some small, fine particulate matter was observed within the hydraulic manifold assembly; however, testing was unable to determine if these particles contributed to the uncommanded landing gear retraction.

There were no injuries. The airplane operated on a ferry flight from Madina (MED), Saudi Arabia carrying ten crew members. The visibility at Jeddah was good with a few clouds present. During the initial ILS approach to runway 16R, while at 8 nautical miles and 2600 feet, the landing gear handle was lowered. Both main landing gears extended and locked down and, the nose gear doors opened but the nose landing gear did not lower. The captain who was then the Pilot Monitoring (PM) took over the controls and carried out a missed approach. The First Officer (FO) became the Pilot Monitoring (PM). SVA 2865 was then given an area to the northeast of Jeddah to carry out attempts at lowering the nose gear. The flight crew attempted to manually free fall the nose landing gear at least ten times. The nose landing gear would not lower into the locked position, but the nose gear doors remained open during all those attempts. As a precautionary measure, SVA 2865 performed a fly-by of runway 16R at 500 ft. The air traffic controller confirmed that the nose landing gear was not down. SVA 2865 was vectored over the Red Sea to lower the fuel load, thus reducing the landing weight. During this period, the Fire & Rescue Services (FRS) at Jeddah foamed a portion of runway 16L between taxiway Kilo 5 (K5) and K2.  SVA 2865 was vectored for an instrument approach for runway 16L. The Auto Pilot and the Auto Throttle Systems were OFF. The surface winds were from 220Â° at 12 knots (kt), gusting to 19 kt and the temperature was +37 Celsius (Â°C). The flight crew used the ""Landing with Nose Landing Gear Abnormal"" checklist ensuring the aircraft was properly prepared and configured for the approach, the before landing, the flare and the touchdown sequences, including when the aircraft stopped and the necessary procedures to secure the aircraft before evacuation. The aircraft landed on its main landing gear 4000 ft past the threshold of runway 16L. The nose of the aircraft was slowly lowered to the runway with the nose landing gear doors touching the runway within the foamed area 4500 ft from the end of runway 16L. The front of the fuselage then touched the runway within the last portion of foam, 3500 ft from the end of runway 16L. The nose area of the aircraft slid on the runway, where sparks were present until the aircraft came to a full stop 1500 ft prior to the end of runway 16L. There was no fire. Cause Related Findings: 1. The NLG up-lock contained a spring, Part Number GA71102 that was broken as a result of fatigue initiated at the third coil of the spring. 2. The spring had been broken for a prolonged period of time, as noted by the spring linear wear marks on the outside area of the spring coils. 3. Damage observed on the NLG up-lock resulted from hard contact with the broken spring during normal NLG operation. 4. The fracture process of the spring was initiated at the third coil level. At least 6000 cycles of fatigue (number of striations) have been estimated by fatigue striation measurements. The crack on the spring started on the internal surface of the spring which was not shot peened. 5. The normal and free fall extensions of the NLG failed due to a mechanical blockage created by the broken spring jammed against the cam.Sources: Report AIB-2013-0002 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  17 April 2012 TC-OAG Onur Air 1 Amman-Queen Alia International Airport (AMM/OJAI) non Location  Images: photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS/EHAM); 03 May 2008 photo (c) Timo Blossfeld; Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS/EHAM); 11 August 2007 photo (c) Willem GÃ¶ebel; Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS/EHAM) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The captain, who was Pilot Monitoring, urged the Pilot Flying to counteract but the airplane continued to the left. He then took over control and applied full right rudder but this had no effect. The aircraft's left wheel entered a trench at high speed, causing the aircraft to flip over and crash 200 meters from the threshold of runway 03, coming rest in an inverted position. All persons exited safely on their own, except two passengers who were assisted by the captain to disembark.

All 45 on board were killed.  A flight plan had been filed for an IFR flight from Halim Airport to Pelabuhan Ratu area then return to Halim Airport.  The flight departed Jakarta-Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport (HLP/WIHH) at 14:21. It flew south and circled Mount Salak (elevation 7254 feet). After circling the mountain, the airplane began to descend from 10,000 feet to 6,000 feet. Last contact with the flight was at 14:30. The wreckage was found the following morning on a near-vertical mountainside on the eastern side of Mount Salak at an elevation of 6,100 feet.  The Superjet was conducting a demonstration flight to prospective customers in several countries. Demonstrations were flown in Myanmar, Pakistan and Kazakhstan before arriving in Indonesia on May 9. Two demonstration flights were planned. The first flight was uneventful. Passengers on the second flight were reporters and representatives of several Indonesian airlines. There were six crew members on board, two representatives of Sukhoi and 37 journalists and prospective clients. FACTORS: a. The crew were not aware of the mountainous area surrounding the flight path due to various factors resulting in disregarding the TAWS warning.  b. The Jakarta Radar service had not established the minimum vectoring altitudes and the system was not equipped with functioning MSAW for the particular area surrounding Mount Salak.  c. Distraction to the flight crew from prolonged conversation not related to the progress of the flight resulted in the pilot flying did not continue to change the aircraft heading while in orbit. Consequently, the aircraft unintentionally exited the orbit.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSC Report number: KNKT.12.05.09.04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: BBC  sergeydolya.livejournal.com  Ministry of Transportation, Indonesia  SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) NTSC; Jakarta-Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport (HLP/WIHH); 09 May 2012 photo (c) NTSC; Jakarta-Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport (HLP/WIHH); 09 May 2012 photo (c) NTSC; Jakarta-Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport (HLP/WIHH); 09 May 2012 photo (c) Sergey Dolya; Jakarta-Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport (HLP/WIHH); 09 May 2012 photo (c) Sergey Dolya; Jakarta-Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport (HLP/WIHH); 09 May 2012 photo (c) Andi; Jakarta-Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport (HLP/WIHH); 09 May 2012 photo (c) Andi; Jakarta-Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport (HLP/WIHH); 09 May 2012 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates19-Oct-2024 19:00 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight was descending through 12,400 feet about 45 miles west of FLL at the time of the encounter.  The airplane was not damaged. The flight crew reported that on initial descent into the Fort Lauderdale area they noticed typical Florida summertime cumulus cloud conditions.  About 20 minutes before the event, the Captain appropriately briefed the flight attendants to prepare the cabin for landing early and to be seated after completing the initial clean-up. The flight crew subsequently illuminated the seat belt sign during the descent.  The flight attendants were still in the process of preparing the cabin for landing when the turbulence was encountered. During descent, the airplane passed in and out of cloud formations.  The crew described, and CVR data is consistent with, passing out of a cloud and noticing a larger developing cumulus in front of them.  The autopilot and autothrust were engaged.  The crew reported that the radar did not indicate any echoes ahead of them.  The Airbus weather radar system includes a Turbulence detection function, which was not used by the crew.  The Airbus flight crew training manual describes effective mode, range, and tilt settings for detecting âwetâ (convective) turbulence.  As the airplane passed into the cumulus development, the airplane encountered convectively induced turbulence, resulting in a peak vertical acceleration of about  2 G and -0.5 G.  The activity was likely developing upwards, possibly below the field of view of the radar, and into the flight path. As a result of the injuries to the forward flight attendant, the flight crew advised ATC that they had an injured crew member and requested priority handling and for paramedics to meet the airplane on arrival.  The ATC approach controller did not forward the request for paramedics.  The crew also attempted to contact the company station agents and dispatch, but received no response.  The lack of ATC coordination, and lack of company personnel to monitor communications from inbound flights, delayed the arrival of emergency medical personnel to meet the flight. Probable Cause: an inadvertent encounter with convectively induced turbulence developing upwards into the flight path, which was not detected on weather radar as configured by the crew. Contributing to the delay in emergency medical personnel notification was the incomplete coordination of paramedic response by air traffic control and ineffective communications monitoring by Frontier Airlines.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA12FA069 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 years and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates07-Feb-2018 13:49 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

It was a regular public transport flight that had been planned to refuel at Sasereme and continue to Balimo and on to Daru. For the flight to Sasereme, the pilot in command (PIC) was the support/monitoring pilot, and the copilot was the handling pilot. The aircraft arrived over the Saserema airstrip at 02:40. While en-route, the crew was informed by the company flight operations staff that it had been raining at Sasereme throughout the previous night until morning, but the prevailing weather was fine. The flight was being conducted under the visual flight rules (VFR) procedures. The copilot had not flown into Sasereme before, so this was a training flight for her. During the cruise before top of descent, the crew discussed the approach and landing requirements. Because of the wet, slippery and rough airstrip surface conditions and a landing weight of 5,300 kg, they agreed on a 30 degrees flap settings and a approach speed of 73 knots. The weather, as observed by the crew, was sunny and fine with few clouds around and the wind was estimated to be light and variable (2 to 3 kt) even though there was no wind sock available to indicate the actual wind velocity. The crew opted to land on strip 14 and joined the circuit on left downwind. Passing through 50 ft the copilot flared the aircraft and it floated in ground effect. As the main landing gear touched down on the centreline of the strip it skipped, became airborne and stayed in ground effect for at least another 20 m. On the second touchdown the aircraft yawed to the left and at that point the PIC took over the controls and applied full reverse thrust. He applied right rudder to regain the centreline, but at the same time the left main landing gear started impacting the ruts in the surface of the strip, severely degrading directional control. The PIC subsequently reported that at that point he felt it was not safe to apply power for an aborted landing. He moved the left power lever out of reverse while keeping full reverse and right rudder input on the right engine and began pulsing the brakes. The left main wheel continued impacting more ruts as the aircraft decelerated. Eventually the left main wheel hit a deep rut pulling the aircraft sharply to the left off the runway. That partially dislodged the landing gear from the airframe causing the left wing to impact the ground. The aircraft came to rest about 5 m from the edge of the airstrip. The PIC shut down the engines while the copilot assisted the passengers from aircraft through the right rear cabin door. The investigation determined that the decision to operate into Sasereme on a scheduled air service, without knowing the serviceability of the strip, was a safety deficiency in the operation of the aircraft and contributory factor in the accident. The PIC did not provide the copilot with the opportunity to observe an approach and landing at Sasereme before allowing her to handle a landing there as pilot flying. The PIC's late decision to take control of the aircraft from the copilot and execute a go-around was also a contributory factor.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIC PNG Report number: AIC 12-1005 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) PNG AIC; Sasereme Airstrip; May 2012 photo (c) PNG AIC; Sasereme Airstrip; May 2012 photo (c) PNG AIC; Sasereme Airstrip; May 2012 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airline transport pilot and commercial co-pilot were not injured. The airplane was taxiing to position for takeoff from runway 8R and its intended destination was Austin, Texas. The flight crew reported that the airplane was about 60 pounds over its maximum weight for takeoff. Since their taxi to the assigned runway was long, they decided to reduce weight by using higher-than-normal engine power settings while maintaining some amount of braking to control speed while taxiing in order to burn fuel prior to takeoff. During the taxi, the right and left main landing gear tires deflated when the fusible plugs in the wheels blew out due to over-heating, and a fire ignited in the right wheel housing. The crew reported that they felt the airplane yaw as the tires deflated and were informed via radio by a following airplane that their right wheel was on fire. The crew brought the airplane to a stop on the taxiway, evacuated, and attempted to extinguish the fire with two hand-held fire extinguishers. Airport fire fighting personnel arrived on scene and extinguished the fire using foam suppressant. The fire resulted in substantial damage to the wing support structures.

There were 58 passengers and four crew members on board. Six passengers sustained minor injuries. Lufthansa subsidiary Air Dolomiti operated flight LH1912 from Munich to Venice, Italy. The flight departed at 13:34. Shortly after takeoff smoke was reported in the cabin. The captain decided to return to Munich.  After receiving clearance to descend to FL110, engine power was reduced. At that time the flight crew noted a Master Caution alert and a fire warning for engine no.2. The pilots fired the extinguishing bottle in engine no.2 and proceeded to shut it down. The descent was continued while the flight crew worked the appropriate checklists. After landing on runway 26L, the ATR 72 began turning left until it ran off the side of the runway. The airplane went into the grass and came to rest with the nose gear collapsed. It was found that the engine failure was caused by a broken turbine blade in the second stage of the power turbine [PT-2]. The turbine blade above the root in the area of the wing had fractured due to fatigue fracture followed by residual fracture due to tensile overload. It was also found that the Travel Limiter Unit (TLU), which limits the travel of the rudder, was in high-speed mode and could only be moved to a limited extent.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BFU Report number: BFU AX002-12 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 8 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Focus.de History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  18 May 2016 HB-ACC Alitalia, opb Darwin Airline 0 Napoli-Capodichino Airport (NAP/LIRN) min Wheel loss/failure Images: photo (c) Andreas StÃ¶ckl; MÃ¼nchen-Franz Josef Strauss Airport (MUC/EDDM); 17 May 2012 photo (c) Andreas StÃ¶ckl; MÃ¼nchen-Franz Josef Strauss Airport (MUC/EDDM); 17 May 2012 photo (c) Remo Garone; GenÃ¨ve-Cointrin Airport (GVA/LSGG); 22 October 2011 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot declared an emergency, diverted to a nearby airport, and landed without further incident. The separated passenger door was subsequently found on a nearby golf course.  The co-pilot reported in a written statement that he closed the main passenger door and checked for a green light to ensure that it was secure. In a subsequent interview, he reported that he ""believed"" that the door warning lights were working, but he could not positively recall seeing the ""Door Safe"" light illuminated after closing the door. He also did not remember activating the ""Recall"" switch before takeoff.  Ramp security video showed that the main passenger door appeared to close; it then re-opened momentarily and closed again before the airplane taxied out of the ramp area. The co-pilot reported that he re-closed the door because it did not secure on the first attempt. An examination of the recovered door and the door frame did not reveal evidence of a pre-existing mechanical malfunction or failure that would have precluded normal operation. The top half of the door was crushed from the impact with the ground, which prevented establishing the condition of door rigging before the accident. An examination of the fuselage revealed a skin puncture that matched the location of the door pull-out handle and is consistent with the door being in the open position when the puncture occurred. Although the door's external handle was found in the closed position, smudging on the fuselage was consistent with the handle's movement from the open to the closed position during impact with the fuselage.  Although it is apparent from the cockpit voice recording that the flight crew referenced the pilot checklist at some stages during ground operations, crew challenge and response items were sporadically mentioned. After the sound of the passenger door closing, neither crewmember mentioned the door warning lights. At no point during ground operations through the takeoff sequence were the doors, door warning lights, or master caution system mentioned. The co-pilot mentioned the ""Annunciator"" check in the Before Takeoff checklist; however, no ""Recall"" response was noted on the recording. Activating the recall switch would have alerted the flight crew to an unsecured door before takeoff. Probable Cause: The failure of the co-pilot to properly close and latch the passenger door before departure, and the flight crew's failure to ensure that the door was secure by using the door warning system. Contributing to the accident was the flight crew's inadequate use of checklists.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The four passengers and two pilots survived. The aircraft left Mombasa-Moi International Airport to drop and pick up passengers at several airstrips in the Masai Mara game reserve. The crew had a day stop in Olkiombo Airstrip before beginning their usual pick-up routine before returning back to Mombasa. The crew testified to have topped up 200 litres of fuel before departing Olkiombo for Kicha Tembo airstrip where they were to pick up four passengers and another 15 passengers from Musiara Airstrip. The first officer reported to have put one large bag at the nose luggage compartment while the rest of the lighter luggage was place at the rear luggage compartment. On the take off roll on Tembo's runway 08, the first officer, who was Pilot Flying, reported to have hit a bump half way down the runway and bounced.  The aircraft hit a second bump and again went airborne prematurely. At that moment the crew reported to have heard a continuous stall warning horn. The pilot flying recalled the pilot monitoring retarding the throttles, an action which made him realize that they were aborting take off. The pilot monitoring reported that there was a bit of tug on the controls between the two of them with the first officer (PF) pushing the control column down for a nose down attitude and the captain (PNF) trying to ease the force on the control column. With very little runway length left, the aircraft veered to the right at the end of the runway and came to a stop approximately 300 meters from the threshold of runway 26. The nose gear assembly was ripped off by the rough terrain and the rest of the aircraft ploughed through the grass for another approximately 10 meters. The aircraft front belly section was severely damaged.Sources: Preliminary accident report  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

This was a non-standard pushback to allow a Jetstream 41 on Stand 11 to taxi out via Bravo One, to Runway 02. This was completed without incident, the tug was then disconnected and all personnel and equipment cleared from the area. One minute later the Jetstream 41, having already started its engines on stand, requested and received permission to power back from Stand 111. At the end of the manoeuvre it stopped on Taxiway Alpha abeam Stand 10 and Stand 11. When DHC-8-402Q G-JEDO requested permission to push back and start from Stand 6; ATC instructed it to âSTANDBYâ. The Jetstream 41 was then given permission to taxi via Holding Point Bravo One, back track, line up and takeoff from Runway 02. G-JEDO was given permission for a standard pushback and start from Stand 62. In attendance were a headset operative and a wingman positioned to the south of the aircraft, and the tug driver. Prior to commencing the pushback the headset operative indicated the direction of the pushback to the tug driver using hand signals. Two minutes later, having seen that the tug was disconnected from G-ECOO,  ATC asked the pilots if they were ready to taxi; they replied they would be in about 30 seconds. ATC replied, âTAXI PLEASE WHEN READY [HOLDING POINT] BRAVO ONEâ. The wingman had by then left Stand 6 for another task. As G-JEDOâs pushback neared completion it slowed and then stopped on a heading of approximately 220Âº. The headset operative asked the commander to confirm that the aircraftâs brakes were OFF, which they were, then reported that they could not push the aircraft any further and asked for the aircraftâs brakes to be set ON. A passing Airside Operations vehicle reported to ATC that there was an âAIRCRAFT TO AIRCRAFT CONFLICT ON STAND 6.â G-ECOO then transmitted to ATC âWE JUST FELT A BUMPâ and asked for confirmation that they had been hit. After photographic evidence had been acquired, both aircraft were pulled back onto stand.

As they taxied, a ground crewmember stood by the wing to ensure the airplaneâs clearance from another airlineâs equipment and signaled thumbs up to the flight crew to indicate when they were clear of the equipment. After taxiing a short distance, the flight crew stopped and awaited further instructions from a ramp agent on the radio for positioning the airplane. Unknown to the flight crew, the deicing team misunderstood the thumbs-up signal to mean that deicing could begin. Consequently, they moved into a position behind the airplaneâs left wing and in front of the left horizontal tail. The ramp agent working the radio could not see the airplane from the radio location and, believing it was still at the gate, instructed the flight crew to taxi 50 feet and stop for deicing. The flight crew initiated taxiing and almost immediately felt a bump, colliding with the boom arm of the deice truck. They then stopped the airplane. The deice truck was not equipped for radio communication; therefore, the teamâs movement and position could not be coordinated with the other ground personnel or flight crew.  Probable Cause: The inadequate communication among ground crew personnel, which resulted in the airplaneâs collision with a deice truck.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA12LA147 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates24-Jan-2012 17:22 Geno Added 24-Feb-2012 11:41 Anon.

However, there was no time to avoid the birds; accordingly, the airplane had head-on collision with one of them.

The airplane was operated by Swiftair under an ACMI arrangement with Gryphon Airlines.  Flight SWT094 departed Dubai Airport (DXB) at 06:08 local time on a scheduled service to Kandahar with the first officer as pilot flying. The en route part of the flight was uneventful. Kandahar approach cleared them for an RNAV (GPS) approach to runway 05, providing a direct vector to the FALOD Initial Approach Fix and to descend to 6000 ft. Runway in use was runway 05, and wind was reported from 060Â° at 17 kt gusting to 24 kt, visibility 1200 m, scattered clouds at 2700 ft and broken clouds at 3000 ft, temperature 1Â°C, dewpoint -7Â°C and QNH 1018 mbar.  The target speed associated with a landing weight of 136,000 lb was estimated at 140 KIAS (Vref 135 +5). At a radio altitude of 1000 feet the airplane was fully configured for landing with flaps 40 and landing gear down. The heading was within margins but the speed was 192 kts. It should have been between Vref (135 knots) and Vref+20 (155 knots). Also, the airplane was above the theoretical glide slope. It was also descending at a rate well in excess of 1000 ft/min. The approach was not stabilized at this point. Since the captain had more operational experience at the Kandahar, he decided to take over the controls and fly the last phase of the approach. The PAPI was out of service, meaning they only had visual references to the runway and above the ground during the final part of the approach. During short final the captain corrected a deviation from the runway centerline by adjusting the flight path from right to left. During the flare, the crew noticed the airplane was shifting to the left, threatening to take them off the runway, as a result of which the captain applied a +20Â° right bank angle at a +9Â° pitch angle. This caused the right wing tip to strike the ground before the wheels made contact with the ground. Touchdown speed was 122 knots, which was below Vref as well as the target speed . The captain regarded the maneuver as a hard landing, although the first officer thought they might have struck the runway. On exiting the runway, the airport control tower ordered the crew to stop and informed them of the damage they experienced. The wing had contacted the ground some 20 m prior to the threshold, resulting in five threshold lights being destroyed by the aircraft. CAUSES: The accident was likely caused by the failure to observe the company's operating procedures and not executing a go-around when the approach was clearly not stabilized. Moreover, the operator lacked the authorization (and the crew the training) to carry out the RNAV (GPS) approach maneuver that was conducted at RWY 05 of the Kandahar Airport. Contributing to the accident was: - The inoperable status of the PAPI at runway 05 of the Kandahar Airport, which was thus unable to aid the crew to establish the aircraft on the correct descent slope.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIAIAC Report number: EXT A-001/2012 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) Werner Fischdick; DÃ¼sseldorf Airport (DUS/EDDL); 18 July 2010 photo (c) Remo Garone; GenÃ¨ve-Cointrin Airport (GVA/LSGG); 15 December 2010 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

ANA Flight NH731, had departed Osaka-Itami International Airport (ITM/RJOO) on a domestic service to Sendai. The captain was Pilot Flying. The en route part of the flight was uneventful and the weather at Sendai was fine. At 09:00 the flight was cleared to land on runway 27. Wind was reported from 160 degrees at 2 knots. At 09:03:04 the aircraft passed the runway threshold at a height of 50 feet and the captain felt the airplane floated. The right hand main landing gear touched down softly at 09:03:14. Four seconds later the captain pulled the reverse levers. Almost at the same time, he felt some vibrations from the airframe like stall buffeting and thought that it was not a normal landing. Determining that the aircraft was still in the air, the captain decided to go around, shifting the thrust levers to TO/GA positions. The nose was raised sharply, reaching +12.7 degrees. The tail struck the runway, causing a 40 cm * 3 m gash and a distorted rear bulkhead. The airplane circled and landed safely at 09:27. There were no injuries among the 166 passengers and crew. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""In this accident, it is highly probable that when the Aircraft rejected the landing after touching Runway 27, its nose was raised sharply, causing the lower part of the rear fuselage to contact with the runway and be damaged.

There were no injuries among the 142 passengers and six crew members. The aircraft was on a scheduled flight to London-Luton Airport (LTN), from Faro Airport (FAO) Portugal. The pilot flying (PF) was a captain-under-training, occupying the left seat; the right seat was occupied by a training captain, who was the commander of the aircraft.  The aircraft was given an early radar vector towards the final approach track to runway 26 and the PF increased the rate of descent to close the correct descent profile from above.  The aircraft was then allocated a heading of 220Â°M, cleared to intercept the localiser and, once established, to descend on the glidepath. The PF realised that the aircraft would be high and configured the aircraft with flap 2 and the landing gear down, to capture the 3Â° glideslope from above. He armed the localiser mode and then attempted to arm the approach mode but inadvertently selected the EXPED pushbutton. The expedite climb mode engaged but, to prevent a climb or any mode confusion and to regain the correct profile, the PF disconnected the autopilot and the autothrust. The aircraft passed through the localiser and ATC issued a revised heading to enable the aircraft to intercept from the south.  The PF decided to continue flying the approach manually and the aircraft was established on the localiser at 5.5 nm. It was configured for landing, with full flap, at 5 nm. Landing clearance was issued, with a reported surface wind of 320Â°/15 kt. A subsequent wind check of 320Â°/16 kt was broadcast three minutes before touchdown. The wind conditions were gusty and gave rise to some turbulence on the approach.  Stabilised approach criteria were met at 1,000 ft and 500 ft radio altitude (RA). The VAPP (final approach) speed was 129 kt and at 50 ft RA the approach remained stable. Just below 50 ft there was a small nose-up pitch input followed by two nose-down inputs and, below 50 ft, the flight data indicated an increasing rate of descent from about 600 fpm to about 850 fpm. The data also showed that, below 100 ft RA, there were some left and right roll control inputs.  Below 30 ft, over the runway, both pilots sensed that the aircraft was sinking rapidly and both initiated a TOGA 10 go-around. The PF momentarily retarded the thrust levers to idle before advancing them to the TOGA (Takeoff and Go-around) position. At the same time, he made a full forward sidestick input, within one second, which was then rapidly reversed to full aft sidestick. As the PF made the forward sidestick input, the commander initiated an aft sidestick input which reached the full aft position within one second.  He followed through the PF, pushing the thrust levers fully forward and announced ""I HAVE CONTROL"". The aircraft made firm contact with the runway at 2.99g and a 12.5 ft/sec rate of descent. It touched down on all three landing gear legs simultaneously, before lifting off and starting to climb. During this phase the PF relinquished control and reverted to the PNF role. The commander remained as the PF, completed the go-around and subsequently carried out an uneventful landing on the same runway. There were no reported injuries. CONCLUSION: ""Both pilots responded to an increased rate of descent approaching touchdown and each initiated a TOGA 10 go-around.  Their initial sidestick inputs were in opposition and, without the use of the takeover sidestick pushbutton, the net effect was a pitch-down control input.  If the commander had operated the sidestick takeover pushbutton, his nose-up pitch input would not have been counteracted by the nose-down input of the Capt U/T. In the event, his control input reduced the effect of the nose-down input made by the Capt U/T.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: EW/C2012/02/03 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were two pilots and no passengers on board. While returning to the airport, the crew advised air traffic control that they had a landing gear problem.  The crew conducted two fly-overs of the airport to allow maintenance engineers to observe the aircraft, and the engineers confirmed that the landing gear was still retracted. The crew decided to land the aircraft with the landing gear retracted, and a full emergency was declared.  The aircraft belly landed at 02:32.  Both pilots escaped unhurt. The ATSB found that an electrical wire to the landing gear selector valve had separated at a connector adjacent to its terminal preventing normal operation of the landing gear to the down position. The investigation also identified an out of rig condition in the landing gear emergency extension system, which prevented correct operation of that system. Factors including the maintenance practices by a number of personnel and inconsistent maintenance documentation contributed to the existence of the defects. Contributing factors â¢ The proximity of the landing gear selector valve electrical wiring loom to the external hydraulic power connectors within the left engine nacelle on Fairchild SA227-AT Metro aircraft resulted in the âdown selectionâ wire being damaged during routine maintenance activities [Safety issue]. â¢ The separation of the âdown selectionâ wire interrupted the supply of electrical power to the down solenoid, preventing extension of the landing gear in the normal operating mode. â¢ The maintenance practices by a number of personnel prior to the occurrence resulted in missed opportunities to identify an out of rig cable within the landing gear emergency extension system. â¢ The landing gear did not extend in the emergency extension mode in-flight due to the out of rig cable preventing correct actuation of the by-pass and shut-off valves. â¢ The flight crew were unable to extend the landing gear using the normal and emergency extension procedures, resulting in the need for a gear-up landing. Other factors that increased risk â¢ The manufacturerâs operational and maintenance documentation suite contained inconsistencies in some procedures. Other findings â¢ The crew conducted the emergency procedures to extend the landing gear in a manner that should have allowed the landing gear to extend. â¢ The low-level fly-past provided for independent confirmation that the landing gear was fully retracted and the gear doors closed.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ATSB Report number: AO-2012-024 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: http://www.atsb.gov.au/publications/investigation_reports/2012/aair/ao-2012-024.aspx  http://www.heraldsun.com.au/travel/news/light-plane-belly-flops-at-brisbane-airport-closing-main-runway-expect-delays/story-fn32891l-1226271375138 Images: Photo: ATSB Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates15-Feb-2012 03:36 harro Added 15-Feb-2012 03:40 harro Updated [Narrative, ]15-Feb-2012 04:01 RobertMB Updated [Aircraft type, Narrative, ]16-Feb-2012 09:49 harro Updated [Aircraft type, Narrative, ]31-Aug-2014 19:50 Aerossurance Updated [Narrative, ]29-Sep-2014 17:52 Aerossurance Updated [Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

There were no injuries to the 2 crewmembers onboard but the airplane sustained substantial damage. The flight was operating under 14 CFR Part 121 Supplemental as a cargo only flight from Anchorage, Alaska (KANC)Â to KILI.  The Captain reported that the flight from KANC had been uneventful.Â  The Captain reported that during the descent, while at about 250 knots airspeed with his hands on the controls and the autopilot engaged, the airplane pitched to about 20 degrees nose down. The captain reported he then disconnected the autopilot and adjusted the pitch trim while pulling back on the column to recover from the pitch excursion. The flight crew declared an emergency andÂ slowed the airplane to about 200 knots.Â  Approximately 5-10 miles from the airport, while in a slow left turn at 3000 feet msl altitude, the airplane pitched down a second time while the captain was hand flying.Â  Â As he recovered from the pitch down, he was lined up for a 5 mile final approach for runway 35. Â The captain elected to make a high speed, flaps up landing and landed uneventfully on runway 35. Post-flight inspection revealed that the left elevator was bent at the mid span trim tab, had partially detached from the aircraft, and was missing two attachment bolts. A review of the airplane maintenance history showed that while in ""A"" check maintenance, a dent was noted in the left elevator and the elevator was removed.Â  The maintenance team did not follow the EMB 120 maintenance manual procedure for removal of the left elevator.Â  During the non-routine maintenance procedures used by the maintenance team, cotter pin safeties that were removed from castellated nuts on the 2 outboard vertical hinge bolts on the left elevator were not reinstalled.Â The removal of these two bolts is not part of the EMB 120 maintenance manual procedure for removal of the left elevator.Â  The maintenance team did not document the non-routine procedure they used to remove and reinstall the left elevator.  The Require Inspection Items (RII)Â inspector had inspected theÂ elevator installationÂ for the procedures in the manual and was not aware of the undocumented non-routine maintenance procedures used, and hence did not examine the nuts that did not have the required cotter pins, which were not to be removed as part of the approved procedure. The FAA found that the maintenance teams that removed and reinstalled the elevator were inexperienced in EMB 120 elevator removal and reinstallation procedures. Probable Cause: the maintenance personnel's failure to install the cotter pins that secured castellated nuts on the left elevator vertical hinge bolts, which resulted in the left elevator partially detaching in flight. Contributing to the accident was the failure of maintenance personnel to document the non-routine maintenance procedure that was used to remove and reinstall the elevator during maintenance.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA12CA042 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 8 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA12CA042  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates04-Oct-2022 14:57 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

The National Weather Service issued multiple in-flight weather advisories current for the destination area including a significant meteorological advisory for occasional severe turbulence between 22,000 and 30,000 feet. As a result, the flight crew advised the cabin crew that service would have to be completed prior to entering the area of expected turbulence. As the flight approached its destination, the flight crew made an announcement for passengers and cabin crew to remain seated and make sure their seatbelts were fastened.

During the takeoff just prior to the aircraft becoming airborne, the Loadmaster, who was seated in the rear of the cargo compartment, heard an electrical buzzing sound and observed an orange jet-like flame shoot across the cargo ramp from left to right at floor level. He then unbuckled his harness and was reaching for the fire extinguisher when an expansive orange fireball erupted, causing him to protect his head with his jacket. Once the fireball receded, he proceeded forward and alerted the crew to the fire while calling for the takeoff to be aborted. Concurrently, the aircraft had just become airborne and reached 10 feet above the runway. With sufficient runway remaining, the Flying Pilot landed straight ahead and aggressively stopped the aircraft while the Non-Flying Pilot notified ATC. Once the engines were shut down, all nine crewmembers quickly egressed and moved upwind of the aircraft. Crash, Fire, and Rescue services responded and expeditiously extinguished the fire. The aircraft was extensively damaged and one crewmember received a minor injury during egress. Cause Factors: 1. The fire was ignited due to an electrical arcing event that occurred between the auxiliary hydraulic system pump motor power supply wire harness and a pressurized auxiliary hydraulic stainless steel braided flex hose installed as part of modification CF-378.  The stainless steel braided flex hose chafed through the electrical insulation of the wire and the subsequent electrical arcing from the wire resulted in a 2mm hole in the flex hose, leak of high pressure hydraulic fluid and ignition of the hydraulic fluid.  2. The CF-378 modification leaflet did not specify sufficient routing and clamping arrangements to maintain separation of the pressurized hydraulic lines from support structure and the hydraulic pump motor wire and the re-issued CF-378 modification leaflet was ambiguous as to the correct location of the test connection support bracket.  3. The approval process for the MPP was deficient in that it did not detect the improper location of the ground test connection bracket, did not adequately consider the effect of the redesign on routing and clamping, did not treat the revised configuration as a new modification, and did not specify the application of the MPP installed alternate parts in the amended parts list.  4. The modification approval process did not contain specific provisions to consider impacts of routing and clamping for wiring hoses IAW CFTOs C-17-010-002/ME-001, Aircraft Electrical and Electronic Wiring and for flexible hoses IAW CFTO C-12-010-040/TR-010, Part 3 Aircraft Flexible Hose Standard Manufacture, Replacement and Inspection.  5.

The pilot, the sole occupant, sustained fatal injuries. The airplane took off from runway 29 on a ferry flight to Manaus-Eduardo Gomes International Airport, AM (MAO). It failed to gain enough height on takeoff and collided with a pole. The airplane came down in a wooded area just off Avenida Torquato TapajÃ³s. Manaus-Aeroclube de Flores Airport, AM has a single, 860 m long asphalt runway. It appeared that the control locks were still in place and had not been removed during the preflight checks. Individual information a) Attitude - unspecified To assume all the responsibilities of flight (flight notification, removal from the aircraft, inspections, etc.) almost alone, the pilot showed overconfidence in his ability to perform such a task, possibly considering it ordinary and of low complexity. In addition, the company mechanic's participation in the preparation of the aircraft may have strengthened the confidence that the pre-flight items that may pass unnoticed would be performed by one technician. b) Memory - contributed The pilot forgot the control lock on the aircraft, which may have resulted from the rush to do the checklist, in which some items were not checked properly, as the existing lock model, which was less visible and was not approved for aeronautical purposes. c) Motivation - contributed The commander proved to be very motivated to make the supply flight quickly, so as not to impair the subsequent flight, which may have interfered with the completion of the checklist so that culminated in lock remaining in place. Information Psychosocial a) Team Dynamics - contributed Although the pilot relied on mechanical help in the preparation of the aircraft, the dynamic established by them did not guarantee the execution of the tasks efficiently and safely. Organizational Information a) Organizational culture - contributed The company since two years used a non-approved control lock and there was no standardization of the procedures of company manuals, which indicates that the fragile safety culture that reverberated in the accident. b) Support Systems - contributed The manuals of the company not clearly specified the activities that the mechanic should follow when preparing the aircraft, thus allowing gaps were created in the execution of the task. Concerning aircraft operation a) Cockpit coordination - contributed The pilot in command stopped using organizational resources available to him to accomplish the task to transfer the aircraft. The copilot had not arrived and the mechanic of the company was not among its duties to perform the complete pre-flight aircraft. Thus, the commander had to perform various tasks in a relatively short time and, therefore, failed to comply with an important item in the checklist that was removal of the lock of flight controls. b) Pilot forgetfulness - contributed The pilot forgot to remove the control lock during inspections (internal and external). Also forgot to perform the checklist of items relating to freedom of controls (aileron and elevator), during taxi the aircraft. The realization of these checks during pre-flight or even in the taxi the aircraft would have avoided the takeoff and, therefore, the accident. c) Managerial supervision - contributed Inadequate supervision of maintenance management allowed the aircraft involved in the accident to possess control locks not certified as an aeronautical product. d) Non-standard procedure - contributed The pilot, possibly due to the rush to perform takeoff, failed to meet a number of items set out in checklist that, if realized, would alert the commands that the lock had not been removed. This item can be considered as the last barrier to prevent the accident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CENIPA Report number: A-626/CENIPA/2014 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Folha  D24am   Location  Images: photo (c) Ulrich F.Hoppe; Manaus; 05 August 2011 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The descent and initial stages of the approach were conducted in night visual meteorological conditions in light rainfall. The flight crew recalled seeing heavy rainfall close to the threshold of runway 29 during the approach. They requested further information about the weather from Air Traffic Control (ATC) and were informed that there was a storm at the threshold of runway 29, extending to the east. The flight crew asked ATC for the reported wind at the aerodrome and were told it was indicating 360Â° 5 kts at the western side of the field and downwind at 5 kts at the threshold. The crew briefed the possibility of a missed approach if the conditions deteriorated. Approaching the runway, the rain increased and the First Officer requested the wipers be selected to high. The flight crew noted an increased sink rate and at 55 ft above ground level (AGL), the thrust levers were set to maximum continuous thrust to arrest the descent rate. At 34 ft, engine thrust was set to idle. As the aircraft entered the flare the rain intensified, significantly reducing visibility. The aircraft landed heavily, recording 2.71 G on touchdown. The tower enquired about the landing conditions and the flight crew reported heavy rain and marginal conditions. This required a hard landing inspection to be conducted prior to further flight. An engineering inspection was conducted in Darwin and a crack in the No. 1 engine rear attachment bolt retainer was found. However, the link between this crack and the hard landing could not be established. A number of components from both main landing gears were also to be replaced as they may have exceeded their design limit.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ATSB Report number: AO-2012-036 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: https://www.atsb.gov.au/sites/default/files/media/3925181/AB2012088.pdf History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  21 November 2016 9H-TQM Hi Fly Malta 0 Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS/EHAM) min Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates30-May-2024 17:17 ASN Added 30-May-2024 17:19 ASN Updated [Time, Location, Accident report, ]30-May-2024 17:19 ASN Updated Corrections or additions? ...

Of the 50 passengers and crew onboard the airplane, one flight attendant received serious injuries and the airplane was not damaged.  The flight was operating under 14 CFR Part 121 as a regularly scheduled passenger flight from Cleveland Hopkins International Airport (CLE), Cleveland, Ohio to PHL. According to the flight crew, as the airplane was descending through about 17,000 feet, the flight initially experienced light turbulence so the flight crew turned on the seatbelt sign.  Shortly after, the airplane experienced severe clear air turbulence that caused the airplane to drop at least 300 feet.  At the time of the turbulence, the flight attendant (FA) was in the galley securing the beverage cart and was thrown to the ceiling and onto the floor injuring her back.  The FA was assisted into her jumpseat by a passenger.  The flight crew declared an emergency with ATC and requested emergency personnel meet the airplane at the gate.  After landing, the FA was transported to the hospital and diagnosed with a fracture of her L-1 vertebrae.

There were no injuries. Flight NM309 had departed Leeds/Bradford Airport (LBA), UK on a flight to Ronaldsway Airport (IOM). The flight had been routine and the crew were flying a day, visual approach to runway 26, in good weather, with the surface wind reported as 210Â° at 14 kt. The commander was the pilot flying (PF) and the co-pilot, who had recently joined the company, was nearing the end of his line training on type.  The approach was flown with full flap and the gear locked and confirmed down by the three green gear indicators. The landing weight was estimated to be 13,448 lb (6,099 kg) and the crew recalled that the Vref was about 105 kt.  Almost immediately the aircraft touched down it leaned to the right and there was an unusual noise. The commander levelled the aircraft with a left roll input.  However, as the speed decayed the lean increased and it became apparent that there was a problem with the right gear. The commander continued to apply left aileron and rudder. Both pilots recognised that the aircraft was likely to leave the paved surface and so the co-pilot held the control wheel and rudder to allow the commander to apply nosewheel steering and operate the feather levers. The left engine was shut down and feathered as the aircraft departed the runway. The right engine was also shut down but its propeller did not feather as the mechanism appears to have been damaged when the blades contacted the runway. The aircraft left the paved surface, yawed to the right and slid sideways before it came to a stop 90Â° to the runway heading. The right landing gear failed as a result of intergranular corrosion / stress corrosion cracking of the forward yoke pintle. This same aircraft (Jetstream 31 msn 785) suffered a failure of the left hand main landing gear while landing at Doncaster/Sheffield-Robin Hood Airport (DCA), U.K., August 15, 2014.

All five on board were killed.  The flight departed Harstad-Narvik-Evenes Airport (EVE) at 13:41 on a flight to Kiruna Airport (KRN). It was part of a three ship formation in the exercise Cold Response 2012 where three aircraft were to fly to Kiruna to pick up personnel and gear. A German Air Force Transall C-160 had taken off at 13:30 and arrived at Kiruna as planned. Last radio contact with C-130J 5630 was at 14:43 with Kiruna Tower and radar contact was lost at 14:56.  Search operations are hampered by cloud cover and poor visibility due to strong winds. The wreckage was finally located on March 17, at 08:30. Debris was scattered on the side of a glacier. The investigation into the cause of the accident showed a.o. that the GPWS/TAWS system operated in 'Tactical' mode and thus did not provide warnings to the crew about the terrain. Also, the airplane operated outside Swedish radar coverage Causes The accident was caused by the crew on HAZE 01 not noticing to the shortcomings in the clearances issued by the air traffic controllers and to the risks of following these clearances, which resulted in the aircraft coming to leave controlled airspace and be flown at an altitude that was lower than the surrounding terrain. The accident was rendered possible by the following organisational shortcomings in safety: - The Norwegian Air Force has not ensured that the crews have had sufficiently safe working methods for preventing the aircraft from being flown below the minimum safe flight level on the route. - LFV has not had sufficiently safe working methods for ensuring, partly, that clearances are only issued within controlled airspace during flight under IFR unless the pilot specifically requests otherwise and, partly, that relevant flight information is provided.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: SHK Report number: Report RM 2013:02 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Aftonbladet  VG.no  SjÃ¶fartsverket  AP   Location  Images: photo (c) Forsvarets mediesenter  /  Forsvarets spesialstyrker / FSK HJK MJK; Mount Kebnekaise; 17 March 2012 photo (c) Forsvarets mediesenter  /  Luftforsvaret; Mount Kebnekaise; 17 March 2012 photo (c) SHK; 2012 photo (c) SHK; 2012 photo (c) SHK; 2012 photo (c) Tom Svendsen; Oslo-Gardermoen Airport (OSL/ENGM); 15 September 2010 photo (c) Tom Svendsen; Oslo-Gardermoen Airport (OSL/ENGM); 15 September 2010 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

Both pilots were killed. The airplane took off from runway 10 at San Juan-Luis MuÃ±oz MarÃ­n International Airport bound for Sint Maarten-Juliana Airport (SXM). It carried 12100 pounds of cargo mainly consisting of bread. Shortly after takeoff the captain declared an emergency, stating that they wanted to return to the airport. They reported smoke coming from one of the engines. Air traffic control cleared the flight to land on runway 10, but the crew requested runway 28 for landing. This was approved and the controller cleared N153JR to land, stating that the wind was ""150 at 3"". The flight came down in the Torrecilla Lagoon on the east side of the airport. It sank in 30-50 feet of water. Investigation showed that the estimated ramp weight of the airplane was 47,710 lbs. The Convair CV-440Âs maximum allowable takeoff weight of 48,000 lbs requires use of both the antidetonation injection and autofeather systems; however, because neither system was used on the accident flight, the maximum allowable takeoff weight was 40,900 lbs. Flight crew injuries were consistent with the first officer flying the airplane at the time of impact; however, considering the first officerÂs limited recent experience in the Convair CV-440 and the performance deficiencies identified in his training and certification history, he was likely not capable of handling the emergency without help from the captain. The captain on the other hand was likely suffering from acute sleep loss at the time of the accident, which would have negatively affected his ability to guide the first officer in properly handling the emergency. Probable Cause: ""The flight crew's failure to maintain adequate airspeed after shutting down the right engine due to an in-flight fire in one of the right augmentors.

The aircraft sustained substantial damage.  The occurrence flight was chartered by a travel agency on behalf of a wilderness adventure ski lodge. It was a regularly occurring charter flight between Vancouver and Blue River, BC, Canada. The travel agent verbally passed weather information to the flight crew. The captain understood that the runway had been plowed the previous day, and that the weather had been good that morning in Blue River. Before departing Vancouver, the flight crew had also obtained official weather data from regular flight planning sources. It was noted that although current conditions at Blue River were good, a weather system was moving northbound, and conditions in the area of Kelowna, Kamloops (CYKA) (the alternate), and Blue River would begin to deteriorate. As the flight progressed, the ski lodge radio room operator overheard the flight crew discussing weather conditions with a local helicopter pilot on the ATF as the flight overflew Blue River, but the operator did not have any direct contact with the flight. The crew was satisfied with the information received from the helicopter pilot regarding local weather. Because the Blue River aerodrome does not have a published instrument approach procedure, the intention was to fly over the aerodrome and proceed under visual flight rules (VFR) into the aerodrome. The flight progressed as planned until the aircraft passed overhead Blue River at the lowest useable IFR altitude, and the pilot was not able to descend under VFR into Blue River. The pilot then climbed back up to an enroute IFR altitude and continued to Valemount Airport under IFR. After conducting the IFR approach into Valemount and finding the weather suitable for flight under VFR, the aircraft completed the 60-nautical mile (nm) trip back to Blue River visually. The aircraft slowly descended in steps as it flew south towards Blue River at a reduced cruise speed of approximately 175 knots. As the aircraft neared the aerodrome, the pilots descended to altitudes as low as 1100 feet above ground level (agl) to maintain visual contact with the ground in deteriorating weather. Approximately 4 nm from the aerodrome, and 85 seconds before touchdown, control was transferred from the first officer (FO) to the captain, who became the pilot flying (PF). During the approach, the crew rushed to complete the pre-landing checks, visually acquire the runway, and manoeuvre the aircraft to land. The captain turned slightly to the left, away from the runway centreline. At this point, the FO called visual contact with the runway, and the captain turned right, back towards the runway centreline, and again passed through the runway centreline. The captain did not acknowledge that the runway was in sight. The aircraft was configured for landing 25 seconds prior to touchdown. As viewed from the pilot's perspective, the aircraft was to the left of centreline. Several seconds later, the aircraft initiated a right turn to line up with the centreline of runway 19, but actually crossed to the right of the centreline. The aircraft then overflew several buildings on the right of the runway centreline, approximately 75 feet adjacent to the runway threshold. The aircraft then turned sharply to the left as it passed abeam the threshold, then sharply right to acquire the centreline before touching down approximately 2000 feet past the threshold. Immediately after touchdown, the aircraft veered left into the snow bank. During the last 23 seconds of the flight, the FO broadcast a traffic advisory to indicate that the aircraft was on final, made 3 speed calls, and advised the captain that the runway was to the left. There were no remarks made by the captain since the request for the landing checklist. The FO did not declare an unstable approach, or prompt the captain to execute a missed approach. Findings as to causes and contributing factors: 1. Although the hazardous runway condition had been identified by the company's safety management system, the delay in action to mark the runway allowed this condition to persist. 2. Up-to-date weather and runway condition information was not provided to the crew, nor was it requested by the crew. 3. The pilot continued the approach below the visibility limits specified in the company's standard operating procedures. 4. Deteriorating weather, as well as the lack of approach aids and runway markings, hampered the pilot's ability to establish the aircraft onto a stable final approach prior to crossing the threshold. 5. The company's standard operating procedures for stabilized approaches were not followed, and an unstabilized approach was allowed to continue. 6. The pilot was unable to position the aircraft over the centre of the runway as it settled to land, and the left main landing gear entered the deeper snow at the runway edge, causing the aircraft to veer into the snow bank. Findings as to risk: 1. If a company's risk mitigation strategy is not implemented in a timely manner, hazards are allowed to persist, increasing the risk of an accident. 2. If company standard operating procedures do not include criteria and procedures for stabilized approaches, or they are not followed, there is an increased risk of landing accidents. 3. Operating on a snow-covered runway that does not have markings or devices to allow a pilot to easily identify the runway surface increases the risk of runway excursions. 4. If the identified risks and mitigation strategies are not communicated to the people exposed to the risks, it is possible they will deem the risk as acceptable to management and continue operations.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A12P0034 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) TSB; Blue River Airport, BC; March 2012 photo (c) TSB; Blue River Airport, BC; March 2012 photo (c) TSB; Blue River Airport, BC; 17 March 2012 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

None of the 296 passengers and 12 crew were injured. The captain on the flight was Pilot Monitoring, the co-pilot was Pilot Flying. The en route and descent parts of the flight were uneventful. The right main landing gear touched down at about 610 m from the runway 34L threshold with a pitch angle of 3.3 degrees and vertical acceleration of 1.27 G. After that, the captain gave large pitch-up and pitch-down control inputs to assist the control of the copilot, and the vertical acceleration of the aircraft fluctuated significantly twice. Due to these changes in vertical acceleration, the captain felt that the aircraft had bounced and was floating, although this was not the case. At this time the speed brakes had activated and the reverse thrust was being applied, but the captain did not notice this. The captain diverted his attention to look outside of the aircraft to confirm its attitude, and then judged to make a go-around. When he noticed that the reversers had been activated, he still decided to continue the go around, although the AOM calls for a full stop landing when reversers have been activated. The captain called for a go around three times but the TO/GA switch could not be activated by the co-pilot because the reversers were selected. The captain then called ""I have control"" and took over controls. All the time the airplane had been rolling on the runway in a nose up attitude, causing a tailstrike. The go around was continued and the airplane landed safely at 16:35. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""In this accident, it is highly probable that the Aircraft continued rolling with the pitch-up attitude after touchdown, causing the aft fuselage to come into contact with the runway and be damaged. It is highly probable that the Aircraft continued rolling with the pitch-up attitude due to the following reasons: after touchdown, the PIC had felt that the Aircraft had bounced to the extent necessary for go-around, and judged to make go-around to avoid a hard landing; even after he became aware that the reverse thrust levers had been raised, he continued go-around; hence, it took time for the engine thrust to increase and he continued to pull his control column. Moreover, it is somewhat likely that, in a situation in which the PIC had been assisting the control of the FO, and without the PICÂs declaring a takeover, the intention of the PIC was not properly conveyed to the FO, the sharing of duties between PF and PM became momentarily unclear, and the monitoring of flight information such as pitch angle and speed, which was the duty of PM, was not performed adequately.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JTSB Report number: AA2014-8 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Flight 120 took off from Tyumen Airport runway 21 on a regular domestic passenger flight to Surgut (SGC). The ATR-72 climbed to a height of 210 m and then banked 35Â° left, followed by a 50Â° right hand bank. It then struck a snowy field approx. 1,6 km past the end of the runway, broke up and a fire erupted. The Interstate Aviation Committee stated that both engines were working properly at the time of the accident.  The Federal Air Transport Agency reported that the airplane had been parked outside for eight hours in weather conditions which included snow and temperatures at and just below freezing level. The airplane was not de-iced prior to departure and the crew did not insist on being de-iced. Causes: The immediate cause of the ATR 72-201 VP-BYZ aircraft accident was the PIC's decision to takeoff without de/anti-icing treatment despite the fact that snow and ice deposits were present on aircraft surface and were discovered by the crew members during taxi which resulted in degradation of aircraft aerodynamic performance and stall during climbing after takeoff as well as inability of the crew to recognize stall and, consequently, failure to undertake recovery procedure. The aircraft stall occurred at the operational angles of attack right after flaps retraction with engaged autopilot before stall warning system activation and was caused by the loss of the wing lift effectiveness due to takeoff with non-removed ground icing. The system cause of the accident were shortcomings in ground handling activities and staff training in UTAir-Technik that became possible because of absence of due monitoring by the Technical and Operation Supervising Directorates of UTAir airline for compliance with airline requirements regarding ground handling and aircraft ground icing protection which resulted in erroneous evaluation of aircraft conditions by the PIC and aircraft mechanic (the shift head kept himself aloof from monitoring mechanic's activities) after the aircraft has been on ground in icing conditions for a long time and in release the aircraft to fly without de/anti-icing treatment. The contributing factors were: - The shortcomings in the UTAir safety management system, which contains, all in all, general issues only and is not adopted for the implementation of Airline activities in particular areas, which did not allow to reveal and correct existing safety risks in a timely manner. - The shortcomings in the UTAir-Technic quality management system, resulted in neglecting of certain requirements of the UTAir ground handling management manual regarding staff training and monitoring for aircraft de/anti-icing treatment which led to the situation when not sufficiently-qualified staff performed the evaluation of the aircraft surface conditions and made the decision on need for the aircraft to be de-iced/anti-iced. - The absence at the time of the accident of basic regulations in force that establish state requirements for ground handling (de/anti-icing treatment in particular) including staff training and organization licensing. - The shortcomings in crewmembers initial and recurrent training as far as the danger of ground icing, its influence on the aircraft aerodynamic performance together with aircraft anti-icing system operation features and design are concerned that did not allow the crew to make the only appropriate decision to return for de-icing/anti-icing treatment after the observation of the snow and ice contamination on the wing after anti-icing system activation in de-icing mode while taxiing for takeoff. - The methodological imperfection of the crew computer based and simulator training programs concerning the prevention of aircraft stall, identification of approach to stall and taking timely actions for recovery. - The increasing need for number of flight crews to perform highly growing flights schedule which, with ineffective SMS, resulted in flight instructor work deficiencies during PIC training and absence of PIC skills to take correct decisions and to strictly comply with the regulations in force. - The possible fatigue of the crew members due to the violation of the work and rest balance while performing split flight shifts together with a large number of unused days-off.METAR: 01:30 UTC / 07:30 local time: USTR 020130Z 24006G09MPS 9999 BKN013CB M01/M01 Q1002 TEMPO 26015MPS 1500 SHSN BLSN BKN005 RMK QFE742/0989 21290060 30750029Wind 6 m/s (gusting to 9 m/s) at 240 degrees; Visibility: 10 km or more; Clouds: Broken, at 1300 feet above aerodrome level, cumulonimbus; Temperature: -01 degrees Celsius; Dewpoint: -01 degrees Celsius; QNH (Sea-level pressure): 1002 hPa; The following weather phenomena are expected to arise temporarily: Wind: 260 degrees, Speed: 15 m/s; Visibility: 1500 m; Weather: Showers of Snow; Clouds: Broken sky, at 500 feet above aerodrome level; Runway state: Runway 21: wet or water patches, contamination 51% to 100%, deposit less than 1 mm deep, friction coefficient 0.60Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: MAK  UTAir  SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) State Ministry of Emergency Situations of Russia in the Tyumen region; near Tyumen Airport (TJM/USTR); 02 April 2012 photo (c) State Ministry of Emergency Situations of Russia in the Tyumen region; near Tyumen Airport (TJM/USTR); 02 April 2012 photo (c) State Ministry of Emergency Situations of Russia in the Tyumen region; near Tyumen Airport (TJM/USTR); 02 April 2012 photo (c) MAK; near Tyumen Airport (TJM/USTR); 02 April 2012 photo (c) MAK; near Tyumen Airport (TJM/USTR); 02 April 2012 photo (c) MAK; near Tyumen Airport (TJM/USTR); 02 April 2012 photo (c) MAK photo (c) MAK photo (c) MAK photo (c) MAK photo (c) MAK photo (c) Konstantin Nikiforov; October 2009 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates19-Oct-2024 18:56 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

In accordance with abnormal procedures checklists, and guidance from the company, the crew elected to use the Alternate Landing Gear Extension checklist to prepare for landing at the destination After pulling the main gear release handle and the nose gear release handle the crew observed that the main landing gear indicated down and locked with green indicator lights, the nose landing gear did not indicate down and locked, and the red Nose Gear Unsafe light was illuminated.  The crew landed the airplane with the main landing gear down and the nose landing gear retracted, and the airplane came to rest on the main gear and forward fuselage on the runway. Post-accident, the nose gear was successfully extended multiple times using the alternate extension handle and the landing gear was also extended multiple times under hydraulic power with no anomalies noted.  Testing of landing gear system components did not reveal any failures that should have prevented the gear from extending via the alternate extension method.  The pull force required to extend the nose gear alternate release handle to a position where the nose gear released from the up and locked position was measured at approximately 72 lbs. According to manufacturer's design requirements, the pull length on the alternate release handle should be approximately 11 inches with a force of 90 pounds. A post-accident review of the alternate gear extension procedures was conducted in a full flight simulator by the investigation group with the participation of the accident flight crew.  The pull force required and the pull length required to extend the nose gear using the alternate extension handle was determined to be significantly lower in the flight simulator as compared to the aircraft. There was no guidance contained in the alternate landing gear extension procedure specifying required pull forces when using the alternate extension handle. Subsequent to the accident, the manufacturer added details to the alternate landing gear extension procedure in the Airplane Flight Manual regarding the maximum pull forces that a pilot may experience when the alternate extension handle is pulled. Probable Cause: the nose landing gear alternate release handle was not pulled with sufficient enough force or distance to release the uplocks and allow extension of the nose landing gear. Contributing to the accident was the dissimilar pull force and pull length set on the flight simulator that was used for flight crew training of alternate landing gear extension procedures and the lack of information available to crew members advising of the dissimilar pull force.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA12FA058 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  4 July 2012 N213WQ United Express, opb Colgan Air 0 Houston-George Bush Intercontinental Airport, TX (IAH) sub Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates03-Apr-2014 16:09 Katonk2014 Added 21-Dec-2016 19:28 ASN Update Bot Updated [Time, Damage, Category, Investigating agency, ]27-Nov-2017 20:37 ASN Update Bot Updated [Operator, Other fatalities, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

They were then scheduled to return, with passengers, to London-Gatwick Airport (LGW). An onboard hand-held Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) HP iPAQ computer was used to calculate the takeoff performance data. Once this was completed, the EFB was placed in the standby mode. The flight to Chambery was uneventful and the aircraft landed at 09:15, 15 minutes behind schedule. The return flight to Gatwick was scheduled to depart at 10:00. The pre-flight preparations proceeded normally and the pilots reported no distractions other than those normally experienced during a turnaround. The co-pilot, who was the non-handling pilot for this flight, completed the manual load sheet whilst the commander programmed the route into the Flight Management Computer (FMC). The commander reported that he then cross-checked the load sheet information and, having ensured it was correct, entered the Zero Fuel Weight (ZFW) into the FMC. The FMC then calculated the Takeoff Weight (TOW) using the fuel weight automatically retained in the system. The commander read back the FMC calculated TOW to the co-pilot, who cross-checked it against the load sheet data and confirmed that they agreed. Having loaded the ZFW into the FMC and cross-checked the TOW, the commander used the EFB computer to calculate the takeoff performance data. This involved waking up the EFB from the standby mode, then entering the airfield, weather and aircraft data, which included the flap position for takeoff. A specific flap setting could be entered, or the computer could be used to provide an optimum setting. The commander stated that he normally entered Flap 5 for the takeoff performance calculation. However, at airports where performance was considered to be more critical, he would set the performance computer to select the optimum setting. As the runway at Chambery is relatively short, the commander chose the optimum flap position calculated by the performance computer. This gave a selection of Flap 1 which, under the circumstances, he did not consider unusual. Similarly, the computed takeoff speeds did not seem unusual to the commander, particularly as they were predicated on a flap setting he did not normally use. The computed figures, based on the data entered on the EFB, allowed for a reduced thrust takeoff. The calculated assumed temperature to be set to achieve this did not seem unreasonable at the time, although the commander stated that, in hindsight, he considered it to be too high for the airfield and the prevailing conditions. Both pilots stated that they would normally cross-check the performance figures once they had been calculated on the EFB. However, on this occasion, and for reasons the pilots could not recall, this was not done. The commander wrote the speeds he had computed using the EFB on the flight paperwork and then entered them into the FMC, overwriting the FMC generated speeds. The commander stated that this was standard practice and on this occasion he did not take note of any difference between the two sets of speeds. The rest of the pre-flight preparation was completed and the aircraft took off from runway 36 at Chambery at 10:08 UTC (12:08 local time), on schedule, with 131 passengers onboard. The pilots reported the weather at the time was good, with a light wind from the east, good visibility and dry conditions. The ATIS reported a temperature of 8Â°C and a QNH of 999 hPa. On takeoff both pilots felt a slight judder, which they considered was due to turbulence from the preceding aircraft. Early in the climb they received a call on the intercom from the rear cabin station informing them that the cabin crew to the rear of the aircraft had also felt a judder. This call was intended for the cabin purser at the front of the cabin, but was mistakenly made to the flight deck. The pilots reassured the cabin crew member, still believing the judder was due to turbulence. Their opinion was reinforced by the absence of any abnormal flight deck indications or calls from ATC at Chambery to the contrary. The remainder of the flight went without incident and the aircraft landed at Gatwick at 11:30. The aircraft was taxied to stand and, after shutting down, the pilots were informed by ground personnel that the underside of the rear fuselage had sustained damage consistent with a tailstrike. This prompted the crew to reconsider the cause of the judder felt at takeoff and they reviewed the takeoff performance data. This revealed that the commander had omitted to enter the aircraft's TOW into the EFB computer at Chambery, with the result that the computer had reverted to the previous TOW data retained from Stansted to calculate the takeoff performance figures.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: AAIB Bulletin: 4/2013 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 12 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) AAIB; London-Gatwick Airport (LGW/EGKK); April 2012 photo (c) AAIB Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Of the 98 passengers and crew onboard, two flight attendants received serious injuries and one passenger received minor injuries during the encounter. The flight was operating under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 as a regularly scheduled passenger flight between Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (KPHX), Phoenix, Arizona, and Denver International Airport (KDEN), Denver, Colorado. According to the operator, the captain was the pilot monitoring, and the first officer (FO) was the pilot flying. The flight was cleared to descend from FL390 to 17,000 feet. The seatbelt sign was on during the descent and there were no pilot reports of turbulence in the area.   The captain turned on the weather radar and noted no returns present between the airplane and the airport. As the airplane passed through about FL320, the captain noticed the airspeed rapidly increasing.  He disconnected the autopilot while simultaneously notifying the FO of the overspeed and began to apply a nose-up input. The FO also began to command a nose-up input at that time and so the captain released his pitch up input. The crew received an overspeed warning and then encountered severe turbulence. The flight crew stated the encounter lasted about 10 â 15 seconds. After the encounter, both Elevator and Aileron Computers (ELAC) faults were displayed. The FO resumed pilot flying duties while the Captain performed the appropriate actions to reset ELAC 1 and 2, report the encounter to air traffic control and dispatch, and contacted the flight attendants.  The A flight attendant (A-FA) was in the forward jumpseat and the B flight attendant (B-FA) and C flight attendant (C-FA) were in the aft galley sitting in their jumpseats without their seatbelts on. During the turbulence encounter, both aft flight attendants struck the overhead ceiling,  panels before landing on the floor. Two passengers who were also not wearing their seatbelts were lifted out of their seats and struck the ceiling panels during the encounter. Oxygen masks in several rows of seats were also released as a result of the turbulence. Two onboard medical personnel tended to the B-FA and C-FA with the assistance of the A-FA.   The captain declared a medical emergency and arranged for emergency personnel to meet the flight on arrival. At the gate, paramedics transported the two injured flight attendants and one of the injured passengers to the hospital.

All three crew members survived without injuries. The aircraft had taken-off from Lokichoggio, Kenya at 11:03 hours for a flight destined for Yida, South Sudan. While at 16,000 feet, approximately 100 miles from Yida, the no. 2 engine reportedly ceased. A restart was attempted and this was successful, but shortly after, the engine ceased again. The crew then opted to proceed to Yida on one engine while monitoring their descent rate. The rest of the flight was uneventful until touchdown at Yida. Shortly after commencing their landing roll, the crew heard a thud. The aircraft assumed a nose down attitude. Shortly thereafter, the nose gear collapsed. The aircraft was still rolling down the runway, with dust and other debris entering the cockpit from the damaged nose gear section. The aircraft eventually came to a stop, the pilot monitoring exited through the emergency exit. He was followed by the flight engineer and Pilot in command exited last. There was neither reported fire nor injuries. The engine just had 20 hours of service since overhaul. The nose gear broke as a result of a hairline fracture in the nose gear assembly, according to the operator.Sources: Airnieuws  Sky Relief   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

It was climbing through an altitude of about FL220 when the crew decided to return to LGW. The emergency return was initiated because of a report of smoke in the cabin. The airplane was evacuated on the runway. First report of the cause of the incident reports technical problem caused a spurious fire warning. There was no fire & no smoke on board.  According to the summary if the incident from the AAIB:  ""The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) was notified of this occurrence by Virgin Atlantic Airways shortly after it happened and the investigation was started the same day. The occurrence was initially classified by the AAIB as a Serious Incident. However, when it became clear that two passengers had incurred injuries defined as Serious, the occurrence was reclassified as an Accident, in accordance with ICAO Annex 13 and the United Kingdomâs âCivil Aviation (Investigation of Air Accidents and Incidents) Regulations 1996â. This classification as an Accident does not reflect the state of the aircraft, which sustained only very minor damage, during the evacuation. In accordance with established international arrangements, the Bureau dâEnquÃªtes et dâAnalyses (BEA) in France, representing the State of Design and Manufacture of the aircraft, appointed an Accredited Representative and was supported by a team which included advisors from Airbus, the aircraft manufacturer, and Siemens, systems manufacturer. The aircraft operator has co-operated with the investigation and provided expertise as required. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) have been kept informed of developments. The aircraft was operating a flight from London Gatwick Airport to McCoy International Airport in Orlando, USA with three flight crew, 10 cabin crew and 304 passengers on board including three infants. Early in the flight the crew received a series of smoke warnings from the aft cargo hold and the commander elected to return to London Gatwick. The crew carried out the appropriate emergency drills, including the discharge of the fire extinguishers in the aft cargo hold, but the smoke warnings continued. The aircraft landed safely, the crew brought it to a halt on the runway and endeavoured to establish the extent of any fire. This produced conflicting evidence and, with smoke warnings continuing, the commander ordered an emergency evacuation. The passengers all left the aircraft within 90 seconds but two injuries, classed as âSeriousâ, were incurred. Subsequent examination of the aircraft and its systems showed that the smoke warnings had been spurious. The investigation identified that injuries were sustained during the evacuation of the aircraft. The evacuation was initiated based on the commanderâs assessment of the available sources of information, including the repetitive and intermittent nature of the aft cargo smoke warnings. The investigation identified the following causal factor for the intermittent cargo smoke warnings: A latent fault on the T1 thermistor channel of smoke detector 10WH, in combination with a CAN Bus fault and possible high levels of humidity in the cargo compartment due to the carriage of perishable goods, provided circumstances sufficient to generate multiple spurious aft cargo compartment smoke warnings. The investigation identified the following contributory factors for the intermittent cargo smoke warnings: The thermal channel fault in 10WH was not detected prior to the event by the internal smoke detector temperature monitoring. The proximity of the fire extinguisher nozzles to the smoke detectors"".

Bhoja Airlines flight B4213 departed Karachi (KHI) at 17:05 on a domestic flight to Islamabad (ISB). This was the inaugural evening flight for the airline on this route. The flight climbed to a cruising altitude of FL310 and continued towards Islamabad. Weather at the destination was poor due to a passing thunderstorm. At 18:19 the captain at a distance observed the squall line. Moments later the flight was cleared to descend to FL200. During the descent the captain and first officer discussed the weather. They were worried about the severity of the thunderstorm ahead. At 18:26 the first officer contacted Islamabad Approach and received clearance for the One Foxtrot arrival for an ILS approach to runway 30. After receiving further descent clearance the first officer discussed opportunities to approach the airfield through a gap in the squall line. The Approach controller gave radar vectors and descent instructions to fly through the gap in the storm. At 18:35, Islamabad Approach gave a weather update and said ""Bhoja 213 surface wind at Islamabad ah is varying between 180Â° to 270Â°, 10 kts and ah sometimes gusting to 20 kts and runway condition is wet, light drizzle is ah uhm going on, braking action not known"". Two minutes later the airplane entered the squall line. Although the Bhoja Air Operational Manual prohibited flight in these conditions, the captain decided to continue. The airplane was configured for the approach with flaps and slats selected and the undercarriage was down. The first officer then reported the speed to be 220 knots, which was 30 knots higher than the recommended speed. The captain reacted surprised as he did not expect this because the he was flying with the auto-throttle engaged. Likely the increase in speed was a result of windshear. The aircraft then entered the active weather cell with precipitation continuing in varying intensity. At 18:39 the airplane captured the ILS and descended on the glide slope. At this point the aircraft should have been in landing configuration with flaps at 30Â°. However, only flaps 5 were selected.  The aircraft then encountered an increasing downdraft. The pitch attitude increased and computed airspeed decreased as the autopilot attempted to maintain the glide slope. The GPWS consequently sounded with the aural alarm: ""Wind shear - Wind shear - Wind shear"". Although the first officer anxiously called for a go around, no action was taken. The downdraft dissipated and the pitch attitude decreased but the aircraft deviated left of the extended runway centerline, and was brought back by the captain. At that moment the autopilot disconnected due to the aircraft deviation beyond the autopilot maximum authority limits. The auto throttle remained engaged in IAS speed mode. Following autopilot disconnect, there was no control wheel activity recorded for approximately 6 seconds and no control column activity for approximately 8 seconds. The crew were likely confused. During this period of control inactivity, the aircraft deviated below the glide slope.  Then the Terrain Awareness Warning System (TAWS) alarm sounded: ""Whoop, Whoop, Whoop"". No action was taken by either crew member. A few seconds later the aircraft entered another downdraft and the rate of descent increased rapidly. The TAWS alarm sounded again, directing the crew to ""pull up"". The captain responded with a nose-up column input. However, pressure altitude and thrust continued to decrease. The downdraft dissipated rapidly, resulting in a rapid increase in angle of attack of the aircraft, which activated the stick shaker for almost 2 seconds. It appeared that captain lowered the nose down to get out of stick shaker regime however, proper and complete Boeing recommended stall and recovery procedures were not carried out. This resulted in a 12Â° nose down pitch. Then another windshear alarm sounded, followed by another stick shaker activation. The first officer shouted to ""get out"" and ""go around"" but the attempts by the captain failed as he did not apply the proper procedures to execute a go around. Shortly after initial ground contact, the aircraft struck a steeply sloped terrace about 5 meters high which resulted in significant structural breakup of the aircraft structure. The ineffective automated flight deck management in extreme adverse weather conditions by cockpit crew caused the accident. The ineffective automated flight deck management was due to various factors including; incorrect selection of cockpit crew on account of their inadequate flying experience, training and competence level for Boeing 737-236A (advanced version of Boeing 737-200 series), absence of formal simulator training in respect of FO for handling an automated flight deck, non-existence of cockpit crew professional competence / skill level monitoring system at operator level (Bhoja Air). The cockpit crew incorrect decision to continue the flight for destination and non-adherence to Boeing recommended QRH and FCOM remedial actions /procedures due to non-availability of customized aircraft documents (at Bhoja Air) for Boeing 737-236A (advanced version of Boeing 737-200 series) contributed towards the causation of accident. The inability of CAA Pakistan to ensure automated flight deck variance type training and monitoring requirements primarily due to incorrect information provided by the Bhoja Air Management was also a contributory factor in causation of the accident.METAR: 13:00 UTC / 18:00 local time: OPRN 201300Z 23020KT 4000 TS FEW025CB SCT030 BKN100 25/15 Q1009.3/29.8014:00 UTC / 19:00 local time: OPRN 201400Z 23020KT 3000 TSRA FEW025CB SCT030 BKN100 20/16 Q1011.0/29.85Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: PakCAA Report number: SIB-350 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) Timo Blossfeld; Johannesburg-O.R.

The airplane touched down smoothly on the main landing gear (MLG) and then touched down on the nose landing gear (NLG). The PIC had his hand on the thrust reversers when he and the SIC heard the landing gear unsafe horn; the left MLG then collapsed followed immediately by the collapse of the right MLG and the NLG. The airplane slid on its belly for about 1,500 ft before it came to rest on the runway. Cockpit voice recorder data confirmed that the unsafe landing gear configuration warning did not occur before touchdown as reported by the PIC.    Postaccident examination revealed that, although the landing gear handle was in the down-and-locked position, all of the landing gear were fully retracted and engaged in their respective uplocks. Extensive testing of the airplane's hydraulic and electrical systems did not reveal any malfunctions that would have resulted in an uncommanded gear retraction. Some small, fine particulate matter was observed within the hydraulic manifold assembly; however, testing was unable to determine if these particles contributed to the uncommanded landing gear retraction.

There were no injuries. The airplane operated on a ferry flight from Madina (MED), Saudi Arabia carrying ten crew members. The visibility at Jeddah was good with a few clouds present. During the initial ILS approach to runway 16R, while at 8 nautical miles and 2600 feet, the landing gear handle was lowered. Both main landing gears extended and locked down and, the nose gear doors opened but the nose landing gear did not lower. The captain who was then the Pilot Monitoring (PM) took over the controls and carried out a missed approach. The First Officer (FO) became the Pilot Monitoring (PM). SVA 2865 was then given an area to the northeast of Jeddah to carry out attempts at lowering the nose gear. The flight crew attempted to manually free fall the nose landing gear at least ten times. The nose landing gear would not lower into the locked position, but the nose gear doors remained open during all those attempts. As a precautionary measure, SVA 2865 performed a fly-by of runway 16R at 500 ft. The air traffic controller confirmed that the nose landing gear was not down. SVA 2865 was vectored over the Red Sea to lower the fuel load, thus reducing the landing weight. During this period, the Fire & Rescue Services (FRS) at Jeddah foamed a portion of runway 16L between taxiway Kilo 5 (K5) and K2.  SVA 2865 was vectored for an instrument approach for runway 16L. The Auto Pilot and the Auto Throttle Systems were OFF. The surface winds were from 220Â° at 12 knots (kt), gusting to 19 kt and the temperature was +37 Celsius (Â°C). The flight crew used the ""Landing with Nose Landing Gear Abnormal"" checklist ensuring the aircraft was properly prepared and configured for the approach, the before landing, the flare and the touchdown sequences, including when the aircraft stopped and the necessary procedures to secure the aircraft before evacuation. The aircraft landed on its main landing gear 4000 ft past the threshold of runway 16L. The nose of the aircraft was slowly lowered to the runway with the nose landing gear doors touching the runway within the foamed area 4500 ft from the end of runway 16L. The front of the fuselage then touched the runway within the last portion of foam, 3500 ft from the end of runway 16L. The nose area of the aircraft slid on the runway, where sparks were present until the aircraft came to a full stop 1500 ft prior to the end of runway 16L. There was no fire. Cause Related Findings: 1. The NLG up-lock contained a spring, Part Number GA71102 that was broken as a result of fatigue initiated at the third coil of the spring. 2. The spring had been broken for a prolonged period of time, as noted by the spring linear wear marks on the outside area of the spring coils. 3. Damage observed on the NLG up-lock resulted from hard contact with the broken spring during normal NLG operation. 4. The fracture process of the spring was initiated at the third coil level. At least 6000 cycles of fatigue (number of striations) have been estimated by fatigue striation measurements. The crack on the spring started on the internal surface of the spring which was not shot peened. 5. The normal and free fall extensions of the NLG failed due to a mechanical blockage created by the broken spring jammed against the cam.Sources: Report AIB-2013-0002 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  17 April 2012 TC-OAG Onur Air 1 Amman-Queen Alia International Airport (AMM/OJAI) non Location  Images: photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS/EHAM); 03 May 2008 photo (c) Timo Blossfeld; Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS/EHAM); 11 August 2007 photo (c) Willem GÃ¶ebel; Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS/EHAM) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The captain, who was Pilot Monitoring, urged the Pilot Flying to counteract but the airplane continued to the left. He then took over control and applied full right rudder but this had no effect. The aircraft's left wheel entered a trench at high speed, causing the aircraft to flip over and crash 200 meters from the threshold of runway 03, coming rest in an inverted position. All persons exited safely on their own, except two passengers who were assisted by the captain to disembark.

All 45 on board were killed.  A flight plan had been filed for an IFR flight from Halim Airport to Pelabuhan Ratu area then return to Halim Airport.  The flight departed Jakarta-Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport (HLP/WIHH) at 14:21. It flew south and circled Mount Salak (elevation 7254 feet). After circling the mountain, the airplane began to descend from 10,000 feet to 6,000 feet. Last contact with the flight was at 14:30. The wreckage was found the following morning on a near-vertical mountainside on the eastern side of Mount Salak at an elevation of 6,100 feet.  The Superjet was conducting a demonstration flight to prospective customers in several countries. Demonstrations were flown in Myanmar, Pakistan and Kazakhstan before arriving in Indonesia on May 9. Two demonstration flights were planned. The first flight was uneventful. Passengers on the second flight were reporters and representatives of several Indonesian airlines. There were six crew members on board, two representatives of Sukhoi and 37 journalists and prospective clients. FACTORS: a. The crew were not aware of the mountainous area surrounding the flight path due to various factors resulting in disregarding the TAWS warning.  b. The Jakarta Radar service had not established the minimum vectoring altitudes and the system was not equipped with functioning MSAW for the particular area surrounding Mount Salak.  c. Distraction to the flight crew from prolonged conversation not related to the progress of the flight resulted in the pilot flying did not continue to change the aircraft heading while in orbit. Consequently, the aircraft unintentionally exited the orbit.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSC Report number: KNKT.12.05.09.04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: BBC  sergeydolya.livejournal.com  Ministry of Transportation, Indonesia  SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) NTSC; Jakarta-Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport (HLP/WIHH); 09 May 2012 photo (c) NTSC; Jakarta-Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport (HLP/WIHH); 09 May 2012 photo (c) NTSC; Jakarta-Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport (HLP/WIHH); 09 May 2012 photo (c) Sergey Dolya; Jakarta-Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport (HLP/WIHH); 09 May 2012 photo (c) Sergey Dolya; Jakarta-Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport (HLP/WIHH); 09 May 2012 photo (c) Andi; Jakarta-Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport (HLP/WIHH); 09 May 2012 photo (c) Andi; Jakarta-Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport (HLP/WIHH); 09 May 2012 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates19-Oct-2024 19:00 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight attendants were still in the process of preparing the cabin for landing when the turbulence was encountered. During descent, the airplane passed in and out of cloud formations.  The crew described, and CVR data is consistent with, passing out of a cloud and noticing a larger developing cumulus in front of them.  The autopilot and autothrust were engaged.  The crew reported that the radar did not indicate any echoes ahead of them.  The Airbus weather radar system includes a Turbulence detection function, which was not used by the crew.  The Airbus flight crew training manual describes effective mode, range, and tilt settings for detecting âwetâ (convective) turbulence.  As the airplane passed into the cumulus development, the airplane encountered convectively induced turbulence, resulting in a peak vertical acceleration of about  2 G and -0.5 G.  The activity was likely developing upwards, possibly below the field of view of the radar, and into the flight path. As a result of the injuries to the forward flight attendant, the flight crew advised ATC that they had an injured crew member and requested priority handling and for paramedics to meet the airplane on arrival.  The ATC approach controller did not forward the request for paramedics.  The crew also attempted to contact the company station agents and dispatch, but received no response.  The lack of ATC coordination, and lack of company personnel to monitor communications from inbound flights, delayed the arrival of emergency medical personnel to meet the flight. Probable Cause: an inadvertent encounter with convectively induced turbulence developing upwards into the flight path, which was not detected on weather radar as configured by the crew. Contributing to the delay in emergency medical personnel notification was the incomplete coordination of paramedic response by air traffic control and ineffective communications monitoring by Frontier Airlines.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA12FA069 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 years and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates07-Feb-2018 13:49 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

It was a regular public transport flight that had been planned to refuel at Sasereme and continue to Balimo and on to Daru. For the flight to Sasereme, the pilot in command (PIC) was the support/monitoring pilot, and the copilot was the handling pilot. The aircraft arrived over the Saserema airstrip at 02:40. While en-route, the crew was informed by the company flight operations staff that it had been raining at Sasereme throughout the previous night until morning, but the prevailing weather was fine. The flight was being conducted under the visual flight rules (VFR) procedures. The copilot had not flown into Sasereme before, so this was a training flight for her. During the cruise before top of descent, the crew discussed the approach and landing requirements. Because of the wet, slippery and rough airstrip surface conditions and a landing weight of 5,300 kg, they agreed on a 30 degrees flap settings and a approach speed of 73 knots. The weather, as observed by the crew, was sunny and fine with few clouds around and the wind was estimated to be light and variable (2 to 3 kt) even though there was no wind sock available to indicate the actual wind velocity. The crew opted to land on strip 14 and joined the circuit on left downwind. Passing through 50 ft the copilot flared the aircraft and it floated in ground effect. As the main landing gear touched down on the centreline of the strip it skipped, became airborne and stayed in ground effect for at least another 20 m. On the second touchdown the aircraft yawed to the left and at that point the PIC took over the controls and applied full reverse thrust. He applied right rudder to regain the centreline, but at the same time the left main landing gear started impacting the ruts in the surface of the strip, severely degrading directional control. The PIC subsequently reported that at that point he felt it was not safe to apply power for an aborted landing. He moved the left power lever out of reverse while keeping full reverse and right rudder input on the right engine and began pulsing the brakes. The left main wheel continued impacting more ruts as the aircraft decelerated. Eventually the left main wheel hit a deep rut pulling the aircraft sharply to the left off the runway. That partially dislodged the landing gear from the airframe causing the left wing to impact the ground. The aircraft came to rest about 5 m from the edge of the airstrip. The PIC shut down the engines while the copilot assisted the passengers from aircraft through the right rear cabin door. The investigation determined that the decision to operate into Sasereme on a scheduled air service, without knowing the serviceability of the strip, was a safety deficiency in the operation of the aircraft and contributory factor in the accident. The PIC did not provide the copilot with the opportunity to observe an approach and landing at Sasereme before allowing her to handle a landing there as pilot flying. The PIC's late decision to take control of the aircraft from the copilot and execute a go-around was also a contributory factor.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIC PNG Report number: AIC 12-1005 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) PNG AIC; Sasereme Airstrip; May 2012 photo (c) PNG AIC; Sasereme Airstrip; May 2012 photo (c) PNG AIC; Sasereme Airstrip; May 2012 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airline transport pilot and commercial co-pilot were not injured. The airplane was taxiing to position for takeoff from runway 8R and its intended destination was Austin, Texas. The flight crew reported that the airplane was about 60 pounds over its maximum weight for takeoff. Since their taxi to the assigned runway was long, they decided to reduce weight by using higher-than-normal engine power settings while maintaining some amount of braking to control speed while taxiing in order to burn fuel prior to takeoff. During the taxi, the right and left main landing gear tires deflated when the fusible plugs in the wheels blew out due to over-heating, and a fire ignited in the right wheel housing. The crew reported that they felt the airplane yaw as the tires deflated and were informed via radio by a following airplane that their right wheel was on fire. The crew brought the airplane to a stop on the taxiway, evacuated, and attempted to extinguish the fire with two hand-held fire extinguishers. Airport fire fighting personnel arrived on scene and extinguished the fire using foam suppressant. The fire resulted in substantial damage to the wing support structures.

The flight departed at 13:34. Shortly after takeoff smoke was reported in the cabin. The captain decided to return to Munich.  After receiving clearance to descend to FL110, engine power was reduced. At that time the flight crew noted a Master Caution alert and a fire warning for engine no.2. The pilots fired the extinguishing bottle in engine no.2 and proceeded to shut it down. The descent was continued while the flight crew worked the appropriate checklists. After landing on runway 26L, the ATR 72 began turning left until it ran off the side of the runway. The airplane went into the grass and came to rest with the nose gear collapsed. It was found that the engine failure was caused by a broken turbine blade in the second stage of the power turbine [PT-2]. The turbine blade above the root in the area of the wing had fractured due to fatigue fracture followed by residual fracture due to tensile overload.

The pilot declared an emergency, diverted to a nearby airport, and landed without further incident. The separated passenger door was subsequently found on a nearby golf course.  The co-pilot reported in a written statement that he closed the main passenger door and checked for a green light to ensure that it was secure. In a subsequent interview, he reported that he ""believed"" that the door warning lights were working, but he could not positively recall seeing the ""Door Safe"" light illuminated after closing the door. He also did not remember activating the ""Recall"" switch before takeoff.  Ramp security video showed that the main passenger door appeared to close; it then re-opened momentarily and closed again before the airplane taxied out of the ramp area. The co-pilot reported that he re-closed the door because it did not secure on the first attempt. An examination of the recovered door and the door frame did not reveal evidence of a pre-existing mechanical malfunction or failure that would have precluded normal operation. The top half of the door was crushed from the impact with the ground, which prevented establishing the condition of door rigging before the accident. An examination of the fuselage revealed a skin puncture that matched the location of the door pull-out handle and is consistent with the door being in the open position when the puncture occurred. Although the door's external handle was found in the closed position, smudging on the fuselage was consistent with the handle's movement from the open to the closed position during impact with the fuselage.  Although it is apparent from the cockpit voice recording that the flight crew referenced the pilot checklist at some stages during ground operations, crew challenge and response items were sporadically mentioned. After the sound of the passenger door closing, neither crewmember mentioned the door warning lights. At no point during ground operations through the takeoff sequence were the doors, door warning lights, or master caution system mentioned. The co-pilot mentioned the ""Annunciator"" check in the Before Takeoff checklist; however, no ""Recall"" response was noted on the recording. Activating the recall switch would have alerted the flight crew to an unsecured door before takeoff. Probable Cause: The failure of the co-pilot to properly close and latch the passenger door before departure, and the flight crew's failure to ensure that the door was secure by using the door warning system. Contributing to the accident was the flight crew's inadequate use of checklists.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The four passengers and two pilots survived. The aircraft left Mombasa-Moi International Airport to drop and pick up passengers at several airstrips in the Masai Mara game reserve. The crew had a day stop in Olkiombo Airstrip before beginning their usual pick-up routine before returning back to Mombasa. The crew testified to have topped up 200 litres of fuel before departing Olkiombo for Kicha Tembo airstrip where they were to pick up four passengers and another 15 passengers from Musiara Airstrip. The first officer reported to have put one large bag at the nose luggage compartment while the rest of the lighter luggage was place at the rear luggage compartment. On the take off roll on Tembo's runway 08, the first officer, who was Pilot Flying, reported to have hit a bump half way down the runway and bounced.  The aircraft hit a second bump and again went airborne prematurely. At that moment the crew reported to have heard a continuous stall warning horn. The pilot flying recalled the pilot monitoring retarding the throttles, an action which made him realize that they were aborting take off. The pilot monitoring reported that there was a bit of tug on the controls between the two of them with the first officer (PF) pushing the control column down for a nose down attitude and the captain (PNF) trying to ease the force on the control column. With very little runway length left, the aircraft veered to the right at the end of the runway and came to a stop approximately 300 meters from the threshold of runway 26. The nose gear assembly was ripped off by the rough terrain and the rest of the aircraft ploughed through the grass for another approximately 10 meters.

This was a non-standard pushback to allow a Jetstream 41 on Stand 11 to taxi out via Bravo One, to Runway 02. This was completed without incident, the tug was then disconnected and all personnel and equipment cleared from the area. One minute later the Jetstream 41, having already started its engines on stand, requested and received permission to power back from Stand 111. At the end of the manoeuvre it stopped on Taxiway Alpha abeam Stand 10 and Stand 11. When DHC-8-402Q G-JEDO requested permission to push back and start from Stand 6; ATC instructed it to âSTANDBYâ. The Jetstream 41 was then given permission to taxi via Holding Point Bravo One, back track, line up and takeoff from Runway 02. G-JEDO was given permission for a standard pushback and start from Stand 62. In attendance were a headset operative and a wingman positioned to the south of the aircraft, and the tug driver. Prior to commencing the pushback the headset operative indicated the direction of the pushback to the tug driver using hand signals. Two minutes later, having seen that the tug was disconnected from G-ECOO,  ATC asked the pilots if they were ready to taxi; they replied they would be in about 30 seconds. ATC replied, âTAXI PLEASE WHEN READY [HOLDING POINT] BRAVO ONEâ. The wingman had by then left Stand 6 for another task. As G-JEDOâs pushback neared completion it slowed and then stopped on a heading of approximately 220Âº. The headset operative asked the commander to confirm that the aircraftâs brakes were OFF, which they were, then reported that they could not push the aircraft any further and asked for the aircraftâs brakes to be set ON. A passing Airside Operations vehicle reported to ATC that there was an âAIRCRAFT TO AIRCRAFT CONFLICT ON STAND 6.â G-ECOO then transmitted to ATC âWE JUST FELT A BUMPâ and asked for confirmation that they had been hit. After photographic evidence had been acquired, both aircraft were pulled back onto stand.

As they taxied, a ground crewmember stood by the wing to ensure the airplaneâs clearance from another airlineâs equipment and signaled thumbs up to the flight crew to indicate when they were clear of the equipment. After taxiing a short distance, the flight crew stopped and awaited further instructions from a ramp agent on the radio for positioning the airplane. Unknown to the flight crew, the deicing team misunderstood the thumbs-up signal to mean that deicing could begin. Consequently, they moved into a position behind the airplaneâs left wing and in front of the left horizontal tail. The ramp agent working the radio could not see the airplane from the radio location and, believing it was still at the gate, instructed the flight crew to taxi 50 feet and stop for deicing. The flight crew initiated taxiing and almost immediately felt a bump, colliding with the boom arm of the deice truck. They then stopped the airplane. The deice truck was not equipped for radio communication; therefore, the teamâs movement and position could not be coordinated with the other ground personnel or flight crew.  Probable Cause: The inadequate communication among ground crew personnel, which resulted in the airplaneâs collision with a deice truck.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA12LA147 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates24-Jan-2012 17:22 Geno Added 24-Feb-2012 11:41 Anon.

The airplane was operated by Swiftair under an ACMI arrangement with Gryphon Airlines.  Flight SWT094 departed Dubai Airport (DXB) at 06:08 local time on a scheduled service to Kandahar with the first officer as pilot flying. The en route part of the flight was uneventful. Kandahar approach cleared them for an RNAV (GPS) approach to runway 05, providing a direct vector to the FALOD Initial Approach Fix and to descend to 6000 ft. Runway in use was runway 05, and wind was reported from 060Â° at 17 kt gusting to 24 kt, visibility 1200 m, scattered clouds at 2700 ft and broken clouds at 3000 ft, temperature 1Â°C, dewpoint -7Â°C and QNH 1018 mbar.  The target speed associated with a landing weight of 136,000 lb was estimated at 140 KIAS (Vref 135 +5). At a radio altitude of 1000 feet the airplane was fully configured for landing with flaps 40 and landing gear down. The heading was within margins but the speed was 192 kts. It should have been between Vref (135 knots) and Vref+20 (155 knots). Also, the airplane was above the theoretical glide slope. It was also descending at a rate well in excess of 1000 ft/min. The approach was not stabilized at this point. Since the captain had more operational experience at the Kandahar, he decided to take over the controls and fly the last phase of the approach. The PAPI was out of service, meaning they only had visual references to the runway and above the ground during the final part of the approach. During short final the captain corrected a deviation from the runway centerline by adjusting the flight path from right to left. During the flare, the crew noticed the airplane was shifting to the left, threatening to take them off the runway, as a result of which the captain applied a +20Â° right bank angle at a +9Â° pitch angle. This caused the right wing tip to strike the ground before the wheels made contact with the ground. Touchdown speed was 122 knots, which was below Vref as well as the target speed . The captain regarded the maneuver as a hard landing, although the first officer thought they might have struck the runway. On exiting the runway, the airport control tower ordered the crew to stop and informed them of the damage they experienced. The wing had contacted the ground some 20 m prior to the threshold, resulting in five threshold lights being destroyed by the aircraft. CAUSES: The accident was likely caused by the failure to observe the company's operating procedures and not executing a go-around when the approach was clearly not stabilized. Moreover, the operator lacked the authorization (and the crew the training) to carry out the RNAV (GPS) approach maneuver that was conducted at RWY 05 of the Kandahar Airport. Contributing to the accident was: - The inoperable status of the PAPI at runway 05 of the Kandahar Airport, which was thus unable to aid the crew to establish the aircraft on the correct descent slope.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIAIAC Report number: EXT A-001/2012 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) Werner Fischdick; DÃ¼sseldorf Airport (DUS/EDDL); 18 July 2010 photo (c) Remo Garone; GenÃ¨ve-Cointrin Airport (GVA/LSGG); 15 December 2010 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

ANA Flight NH731, had departed Osaka-Itami International Airport (ITM/RJOO) on a domestic service to Sendai. The captain was Pilot Flying. The en route part of the flight was uneventful and the weather at Sendai was fine. At 09:00 the flight was cleared to land on runway 27. Wind was reported from 160 degrees at 2 knots. At 09:03:04 the aircraft passed the runway threshold at a height of 50 feet and the captain felt the airplane floated. The right hand main landing gear touched down softly at 09:03:14. Four seconds later the captain pulled the reverse levers. Almost at the same time, he felt some vibrations from the airframe like stall buffeting and thought that it was not a normal landing. Determining that the aircraft was still in the air, the captain decided to go around, shifting the thrust levers to TO/GA positions. The nose was raised sharply, reaching +12.7 degrees. The tail struck the runway, causing a 40 cm * 3 m gash and a distorted rear bulkhead. The airplane circled and landed safely at 09:27. There were no injuries among the 166 passengers and crew.

There were no injuries among the 142 passengers and six crew members. The aircraft was on a scheduled flight to London-Luton Airport (LTN), from Faro Airport (FAO) Portugal. The pilot flying (PF) was a captain-under-training, occupying the left seat; the right seat was occupied by a training captain, who was the commander of the aircraft.  The aircraft was given an early radar vector towards the final approach track to runway 26 and the PF increased the rate of descent to close the correct descent profile from above.  The aircraft was then allocated a heading of 220Â°M, cleared to intercept the localiser and, once established, to descend on the glidepath. The PF realised that the aircraft would be high and configured the aircraft with flap 2 and the landing gear down, to capture the 3Â° glideslope from above. He armed the localiser mode and then attempted to arm the approach mode but inadvertently selected the EXPED pushbutton. The expedite climb mode engaged but, to prevent a climb or any mode confusion and to regain the correct profile, the PF disconnected the autopilot and the autothrust. The aircraft passed through the localiser and ATC issued a revised heading to enable the aircraft to intercept from the south.  The PF decided to continue flying the approach manually and the aircraft was established on the localiser at 5.5 nm. It was configured for landing, with full flap, at 5 nm. Landing clearance was issued, with a reported surface wind of 320Â°/15 kt. A subsequent wind check of 320Â°/16 kt was broadcast three minutes before touchdown. The wind conditions were gusty and gave rise to some turbulence on the approach.  Stabilised approach criteria were met at 1,000 ft and 500 ft radio altitude (RA). The VAPP (final approach) speed was 129 kt and at 50 ft RA the approach remained stable. Just below 50 ft there was a small nose-up pitch input followed by two nose-down inputs and, below 50 ft, the flight data indicated an increasing rate of descent from about 600 fpm to about 850 fpm. The data also showed that, below 100 ft RA, there were some left and right roll control inputs.  Below 30 ft, over the runway, both pilots sensed that the aircraft was sinking rapidly and both initiated a TOGA 10 go-around. The PF momentarily retarded the thrust levers to idle before advancing them to the TOGA (Takeoff and Go-around) position. At the same time, he made a full forward sidestick input, within one second, which was then rapidly reversed to full aft sidestick. As the PF made the forward sidestick input, the commander initiated an aft sidestick input which reached the full aft position within one second.  He followed through the PF, pushing the thrust levers fully forward and announced ""I HAVE CONTROL"". The aircraft made firm contact with the runway at 2.99g and a 12.5 ft/sec rate of descent. It touched down on all three landing gear legs simultaneously, before lifting off and starting to climb. During this phase the PF relinquished control and reverted to the PNF role. The commander remained as the PF, completed the go-around and subsequently carried out an uneventful landing on the same runway. There were no reported injuries. CONCLUSION: ""Both pilots responded to an increased rate of descent approaching touchdown and each initiated a TOGA 10 go-around.  Their initial sidestick inputs were in opposition and, without the use of the takeover sidestick pushbutton, the net effect was a pitch-down control input.  If the commander had operated the sidestick takeover pushbutton, his nose-up pitch input would not have been counteracted by the nose-down input of the Capt U/T. In the event, his control input reduced the effect of the nose-down input made by the Capt U/T.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: EW/C2012/02/03 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were two pilots and no passengers on board. While returning to the airport, the crew advised air traffic control that they had a landing gear problem.  The crew conducted two fly-overs of the airport to allow maintenance engineers to observe the aircraft, and the engineers confirmed that the landing gear was still retracted. The crew decided to land the aircraft with the landing gear retracted, and a full emergency was declared.  The aircraft belly landed at 02:32.  Both pilots escaped unhurt. The ATSB found that an electrical wire to the landing gear selector valve had separated at a connector adjacent to its terminal preventing normal operation of the landing gear to the down position. The investigation also identified an out of rig condition in the landing gear emergency extension system, which prevented correct operation of that system. Factors including the maintenance practices by a number of personnel and inconsistent maintenance documentation contributed to the existence of the defects. Contributing factors â¢ The proximity of the landing gear selector valve electrical wiring loom to the external hydraulic power connectors within the left engine nacelle on Fairchild SA227-AT Metro aircraft resulted in the âdown selectionâ wire being damaged during routine maintenance activities [Safety issue]. â¢ The separation of the âdown selectionâ wire interrupted the supply of electrical power to the down solenoid, preventing extension of the landing gear in the normal operating mode. â¢ The maintenance practices by a number of personnel prior to the occurrence resulted in missed opportunities to identify an out of rig cable within the landing gear emergency extension system. â¢ The landing gear did not extend in the emergency extension mode in-flight due to the out of rig cable preventing correct actuation of the by-pass and shut-off valves. â¢ The flight crew were unable to extend the landing gear using the normal and emergency extension procedures, resulting in the need for a gear-up landing. Other factors that increased risk â¢ The manufacturerâs operational and maintenance documentation suite contained inconsistencies in some procedures. Other findings â¢ The crew conducted the emergency procedures to extend the landing gear in a manner that should have allowed the landing gear to extend. â¢ The low-level fly-past provided for independent confirmation that the landing gear was fully retracted and the gear doors closed.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ATSB Report number: AO-2012-024 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: http://www.atsb.gov.au/publications/investigation_reports/2012/aair/ao-2012-024.aspx  http://www.heraldsun.com.au/travel/news/light-plane-belly-flops-at-brisbane-airport-closing-main-runway-expect-delays/story-fn32891l-1226271375138 Images: Photo: ATSB Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates15-Feb-2012 03:36 harro Added 15-Feb-2012 03:40 harro Updated [Narrative, ]15-Feb-2012 04:01 RobertMB Updated [Aircraft type, Narrative, ]16-Feb-2012 09:49 harro Updated [Aircraft type, Narrative, ]31-Aug-2014 19:50 Aerossurance Updated [Narrative, ]29-Sep-2014 17:52 Aerossurance Updated [Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

There were no injuries to the 2 crewmembers onboard but the airplane sustained substantial damage. The flight was operating under 14 CFR Part 121 Supplemental as a cargo only flight from Anchorage, Alaska (KANC)Â to KILI.  The Captain reported that the flight from KANC had been uneventful.Â  The Captain reported that during the descent, while at about 250 knots airspeed with his hands on the controls and the autopilot engaged, the airplane pitched to about 20 degrees nose down. The captain reported he then disconnected the autopilot and adjusted the pitch trim while pulling back on the column to recover from the pitch excursion. The flight crew declared an emergency andÂ slowed the airplane to about 200 knots.Â  Approximately 5-10 miles from the airport, while in a slow left turn at 3000 feet msl altitude, the airplane pitched down a second time while the captain was hand flying.Â  Â As he recovered from the pitch down, he was lined up for a 5 mile final approach for runway 35. Â The captain elected to make a high speed, flaps up landing and landed uneventfully on runway 35. Post-flight inspection revealed that the left elevator was bent at the mid span trim tab, had partially detached from the aircraft, and was missing two attachment bolts. A review of the airplane maintenance history showed that while in ""A"" check maintenance, a dent was noted in the left elevator and the elevator was removed.Â  The maintenance team did not follow the EMB 120 maintenance manual procedure for removal of the left elevator.Â  During the non-routine maintenance procedures used by the maintenance team, cotter pin safeties that were removed from castellated nuts on the 2 outboard vertical hinge bolts on the left elevator were not reinstalled.Â The removal of these two bolts is not part of the EMB 120 maintenance manual procedure for removal of the left elevator.Â  The maintenance team did not document the non-routine procedure they used to remove and reinstall the left elevator.  The Require Inspection Items (RII)Â inspector had inspected theÂ elevator installationÂ for the procedures in the manual and was not aware of the undocumented non-routine maintenance procedures used, and hence did not examine the nuts that did not have the required cotter pins, which were not to be removed as part of the approved procedure. The FAA found that the maintenance teams that removed and reinstalled the elevator were inexperienced in EMB 120 elevator removal and reinstallation procedures. Probable Cause: the maintenance personnel's failure to install the cotter pins that secured castellated nuts on the left elevator vertical hinge bolts, which resulted in the left elevator partially detaching in flight. Contributing to the accident was the failure of maintenance personnel to document the non-routine maintenance procedure that was used to remove and reinstall the elevator during maintenance.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA12CA042 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 8 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA12CA042  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates04-Oct-2022 14:57 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

During the takeoff just prior to the aircraft becoming airborne, the Loadmaster, who was seated in the rear of the cargo compartment, heard an electrical buzzing sound and observed an orange jet-like flame shoot across the cargo ramp from left to right at floor level. He then unbuckled his harness and was reaching for the fire extinguisher when an expansive orange fireball erupted, causing him to protect his head with his jacket. Once the fireball receded, he proceeded forward and alerted the crew to the fire while calling for the takeoff to be aborted. Concurrently, the aircraft had just become airborne and reached 10 feet above the runway. With sufficient runway remaining, the Flying Pilot landed straight ahead and aggressively stopped the aircraft while the Non-Flying Pilot notified ATC. Once the engines were shut down, all nine crewmembers quickly egressed and moved upwind of the aircraft. Crash, Fire, and Rescue services responded and expeditiously extinguished the fire. The aircraft was extensively damaged and one crewmember received a minor injury during egress. Cause Factors: 1. The fire was ignited due to an electrical arcing event that occurred between the auxiliary hydraulic system pump motor power supply wire harness and a pressurized auxiliary hydraulic stainless steel braided flex hose installed as part of modification CF-378.  The stainless steel braided flex hose chafed through the electrical insulation of the wire and the subsequent electrical arcing from the wire resulted in a 2mm hole in the flex hose, leak of high pressure hydraulic fluid and ignition of the hydraulic fluid.  2. The CF-378 modification leaflet did not specify sufficient routing and clamping arrangements to maintain separation of the pressurized hydraulic lines from support structure and the hydraulic pump motor wire and the re-issued CF-378 modification leaflet was ambiguous as to the correct location of the test connection support bracket.  3. The approval process for the MPP was deficient in that it did not detect the improper location of the ground test connection bracket, did not adequately consider the effect of the redesign on routing and clamping, did not treat the revised configuration as a new modification, and did not specify the application of the MPP installed alternate parts in the amended parts list.  4. The modification approval process did not contain specific provisions to consider impacts of routing and clamping for wiring hoses IAW CFTOs C-17-010-002/ME-001, Aircraft Electrical and Electronic Wiring and for flexible hoses IAW CFTO C-12-010-040/TR-010, Part 3 Aircraft Flexible Hose Standard Manufacture, Replacement and Inspection.  5.

The pilot, the sole occupant, sustained fatal injuries. The airplane took off from runway 29 on a ferry flight to Manaus-Eduardo Gomes International Airport, AM (MAO). It failed to gain enough height on takeoff and collided with a pole. The airplane came down in a wooded area just off Avenida Torquato TapajÃ³s. Manaus-Aeroclube de Flores Airport, AM has a single, 860 m long asphalt runway. It appeared that the control locks were still in place and had not been removed during the preflight checks. Individual information a) Attitude - unspecified To assume all the responsibilities of flight (flight notification, removal from the aircraft, inspections, etc.) almost alone, the pilot showed overconfidence in his ability to perform such a task, possibly considering it ordinary and of low complexity. In addition, the company mechanic's participation in the preparation of the aircraft may have strengthened the confidence that the pre-flight items that may pass unnoticed would be performed by one technician. b) Memory - contributed The pilot forgot the control lock on the aircraft, which may have resulted from the rush to do the checklist, in which some items were not checked properly, as the existing lock model, which was less visible and was not approved for aeronautical purposes. c) Motivation - contributed The commander proved to be very motivated to make the supply flight quickly, so as not to impair the subsequent flight, which may have interfered with the completion of the checklist so that culminated in lock remaining in place. Information Psychosocial a) Team Dynamics - contributed Although the pilot relied on mechanical help in the preparation of the aircraft, the dynamic established by them did not guarantee the execution of the tasks efficiently and safely. Organizational Information a) Organizational culture - contributed The company since two years used a non-approved control lock and there was no standardization of the procedures of company manuals, which indicates that the fragile safety culture that reverberated in the accident. b) Support Systems - contributed The manuals of the company not clearly specified the activities that the mechanic should follow when preparing the aircraft, thus allowing gaps were created in the execution of the task. Concerning aircraft operation a) Cockpit coordination - contributed The pilot in command stopped using organizational resources available to him to accomplish the task to transfer the aircraft. The copilot had not arrived and the mechanic of the company was not among its duties to perform the complete pre-flight aircraft. Thus, the commander had to perform various tasks in a relatively short time and, therefore, failed to comply with an important item in the checklist that was removal of the lock of flight controls. b) Pilot forgetfulness - contributed The pilot forgot to remove the control lock during inspections (internal and external). Also forgot to perform the checklist of items relating to freedom of controls (aileron and elevator), during taxi the aircraft. The realization of these checks during pre-flight or even in the taxi the aircraft would have avoided the takeoff and, therefore, the accident. c) Managerial supervision - contributed Inadequate supervision of maintenance management allowed the aircraft involved in the accident to possess control locks not certified as an aeronautical product. d) Non-standard procedure - contributed The pilot, possibly due to the rush to perform takeoff, failed to meet a number of items set out in checklist that, if realized, would alert the commands that the lock had not been removed. This item can be considered as the last barrier to prevent the accident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CENIPA Report number: A-626/CENIPA/2014 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Folha  D24am   Location  Images: photo (c) Ulrich F.Hoppe; Manaus; 05 August 2011 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The descent and initial stages of the approach were conducted in night visual meteorological conditions in light rainfall. The flight crew recalled seeing heavy rainfall close to the threshold of runway 29 during the approach. They requested further information about the weather from Air Traffic Control (ATC) and were informed that there was a storm at the threshold of runway 29, extending to the east. The flight crew asked ATC for the reported wind at the aerodrome and were told it was indicating 360Â° 5 kts at the western side of the field and downwind at 5 kts at the threshold. The crew briefed the possibility of a missed approach if the conditions deteriorated. Approaching the runway, the rain increased and the First Officer requested the wipers be selected to high. The flight crew noted an increased sink rate and at 55 ft above ground level (AGL), the thrust levers were set to maximum continuous thrust to arrest the descent rate. At 34 ft, engine thrust was set to idle. As the aircraft entered the flare the rain intensified, significantly reducing visibility. The aircraft landed heavily, recording 2.71 G on touchdown. The tower enquired about the landing conditions and the flight crew reported heavy rain and marginal conditions. This required a hard landing inspection to be conducted prior to further flight. An engineering inspection was conducted in Darwin and a crack in the No. 1 engine rear attachment bolt retainer was found. However, the link between this crack and the hard landing could not be established. A number of components from both main landing gears were also to be replaced as they may have exceeded their design limit.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ATSB Report number: AO-2012-036 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: https://www.atsb.gov.au/sites/default/files/media/3925181/AB2012088.pdf History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  21 November 2016 9H-TQM Hi Fly Malta 0 Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS/EHAM) min Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates30-May-2024 17:17 ASN Added 30-May-2024 17:19 ASN Updated [Time, Location, Accident report, ]30-May-2024 17:19 ASN Updated Corrections or additions? ...

Of the 50 passengers and crew onboard the airplane, one flight attendant received serious injuries and the airplane was not damaged.  The flight was operating under 14 CFR Part 121 as a regularly scheduled passenger flight from Cleveland Hopkins International Airport (CLE), Cleveland, Ohio to PHL. According to the flight crew, as the airplane was descending through about 17,000 feet, the flight initially experienced light turbulence so the flight crew turned on the seatbelt sign.  Shortly after, the airplane experienced severe clear air turbulence that caused the airplane to drop at least 300 feet.  At the time of the turbulence, the flight attendant (FA) was in the galley securing the beverage cart and was thrown to the ceiling and onto the floor injuring her back.  The FA was assisted into her jumpseat by a passenger.  The flight crew declared an emergency with ATC and requested emergency personnel meet the airplane at the gate.  After landing, the FA was transported to the hospital and diagnosed with a fracture of her L-1 vertebrae.

There were no injuries. Flight NM309 had departed Leeds/Bradford Airport (LBA), UK on a flight to Ronaldsway Airport (IOM). The flight had been routine and the crew were flying a day, visual approach to runway 26, in good weather, with the surface wind reported as 210Â° at 14 kt. The commander was the pilot flying (PF) and the co-pilot, who had recently joined the company, was nearing the end of his line training on type.  The approach was flown with full flap and the gear locked and confirmed down by the three green gear indicators. The landing weight was estimated to be 13,448 lb (6,099 kg) and the crew recalled that the Vref was about 105 kt.  Almost immediately the aircraft touched down it leaned to the right and there was an unusual noise. The commander levelled the aircraft with a left roll input.  However, as the speed decayed the lean increased and it became apparent that there was a problem with the right gear. The commander continued to apply left aileron and rudder. Both pilots recognised that the aircraft was likely to leave the paved surface and so the co-pilot held the control wheel and rudder to allow the commander to apply nosewheel steering and operate the feather levers. The left engine was shut down and feathered as the aircraft departed the runway. The right engine was also shut down but its propeller did not feather as the mechanism appears to have been damaged when the blades contacted the runway. The aircraft left the paved surface, yawed to the right and slid sideways before it came to a stop 90Â° to the runway heading. The right landing gear failed as a result of intergranular corrosion / stress corrosion cracking of the forward yoke pintle. This same aircraft (Jetstream 31 msn 785) suffered a failure of the left hand main landing gear while landing at Doncaster/Sheffield-Robin Hood Airport (DCA), U.K., August 15, 2014.

All five on board were killed.  The flight departed Harstad-Narvik-Evenes Airport (EVE) at 13:41 on a flight to Kiruna Airport (KRN). It was part of a three ship formation in the exercise Cold Response 2012 where three aircraft were to fly to Kiruna to pick up personnel and gear. A German Air Force Transall C-160 had taken off at 13:30 and arrived at Kiruna as planned. Last radio contact with C-130J 5630 was at 14:43 with Kiruna Tower and radar contact was lost at 14:56.  Search operations are hampered by cloud cover and poor visibility due to strong winds. The wreckage was finally located on March 17, at 08:30. Debris was scattered on the side of a glacier. The investigation into the cause of the accident showed a.o. that the GPWS/TAWS system operated in 'Tactical' mode and thus did not provide warnings to the crew about the terrain. Also, the airplane operated outside Swedish radar coverage Causes The accident was caused by the crew on HAZE 01 not noticing to the shortcomings in the clearances issued by the air traffic controllers and to the risks of following these clearances, which resulted in the aircraft coming to leave controlled airspace and be flown at an altitude that was lower than the surrounding terrain. The accident was rendered possible by the following organisational shortcomings in safety: - The Norwegian Air Force has not ensured that the crews have had sufficiently safe working methods for preventing the aircraft from being flown below the minimum safe flight level on the route. - LFV has not had sufficiently safe working methods for ensuring, partly, that clearances are only issued within controlled airspace during flight under IFR unless the pilot specifically requests otherwise and, partly, that relevant flight information is provided.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: SHK Report number: Report RM 2013:02 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Aftonbladet  VG.no  SjÃ¶fartsverket  AP   Location  Images: photo (c) Forsvarets mediesenter  /  Forsvarets spesialstyrker / FSK HJK MJK; Mount Kebnekaise; 17 March 2012 photo (c) Forsvarets mediesenter  /  Luftforsvaret; Mount Kebnekaise; 17 March 2012 photo (c) SHK; 2012 photo (c) SHK; 2012 photo (c) SHK; 2012 photo (c) Tom Svendsen; Oslo-Gardermoen Airport (OSL/ENGM); 15 September 2010 photo (c) Tom Svendsen; Oslo-Gardermoen Airport (OSL/ENGM); 15 September 2010 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

Both pilots were killed. The airplane took off from runway 10 at San Juan-Luis MuÃ±oz MarÃ­n International Airport bound for Sint Maarten-Juliana Airport (SXM). It carried 12100 pounds of cargo mainly consisting of bread. Shortly after takeoff the captain declared an emergency, stating that they wanted to return to the airport. They reported smoke coming from one of the engines. Air traffic control cleared the flight to land on runway 10, but the crew requested runway 28 for landing. This was approved and the controller cleared N153JR to land, stating that the wind was ""150 at 3"". The flight came down in the Torrecilla Lagoon on the east side of the airport. It sank in 30-50 feet of water. Investigation showed that the estimated ramp weight of the airplane was 47,710 lbs. The Convair CV-440Âs maximum allowable takeoff weight of 48,000 lbs requires use of both the antidetonation injection and autofeather systems; however, because neither system was used on the accident flight, the maximum allowable takeoff weight was 40,900 lbs. Flight crew injuries were consistent with the first officer flying the airplane at the time of impact; however, considering the first officerÂs limited recent experience in the Convair CV-440 and the performance deficiencies identified in his training and certification history, he was likely not capable of handling the emergency without help from the captain. The captain on the other hand was likely suffering from acute sleep loss at the time of the accident, which would have negatively affected his ability to guide the first officer in properly handling the emergency. Probable Cause: ""The flight crew's failure to maintain adequate airspeed after shutting down the right engine due to an in-flight fire in one of the right augmentors. The failure to maintain airspeed resulted in either an aerodynamic stall or a loss of directional control.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NTSB/AAR-14/04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Primerahora  El Nuevo Dia  NTSB  SKYbraryÂ  History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  19 February 1961 N94256 Lyndon B Johnson 2 LBJ Ranch, TX w/o Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; San Juan-Luis MuÃ±oz MarÃ­n International Airport (SJU); 15 March 2012; (publicdomain) photo (c) Brian T Richards; Sint Maarten-Juliana Airport (SXM/TNCM); 01 March 2010 photo (c) Sergio Cardona; San Juan-Luis MuÃ±oz MarÃ­n International Airport (SJU/TJSJ); 13 June 2011 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft sustained substantial damage.  The occurrence flight was chartered by a travel agency on behalf of a wilderness adventure ski lodge. It was a regularly occurring charter flight between Vancouver and Blue River, BC, Canada. The travel agent verbally passed weather information to the flight crew. The captain understood that the runway had been plowed the previous day, and that the weather had been good that morning in Blue River. Before departing Vancouver, the flight crew had also obtained official weather data from regular flight planning sources. It was noted that although current conditions at Blue River were good, a weather system was moving northbound, and conditions in the area of Kelowna, Kamloops (CYKA) (the alternate), and Blue River would begin to deteriorate. As the flight progressed, the ski lodge radio room operator overheard the flight crew discussing weather conditions with a local helicopter pilot on the ATF as the flight overflew Blue River, but the operator did not have any direct contact with the flight. The crew was satisfied with the information received from the helicopter pilot regarding local weather. Because the Blue River aerodrome does not have a published instrument approach procedure, the intention was to fly over the aerodrome and proceed under visual flight rules (VFR) into the aerodrome. The flight progressed as planned until the aircraft passed overhead Blue River at the lowest useable IFR altitude, and the pilot was not able to descend under VFR into Blue River. The pilot then climbed back up to an enroute IFR altitude and continued to Valemount Airport under IFR. After conducting the IFR approach into Valemount and finding the weather suitable for flight under VFR, the aircraft completed the 60-nautical mile (nm) trip back to Blue River visually. The aircraft slowly descended in steps as it flew south towards Blue River at a reduced cruise speed of approximately 175 knots. As the aircraft neared the aerodrome, the pilots descended to altitudes as low as 1100 feet above ground level (agl) to maintain visual contact with the ground in deteriorating weather. Approximately 4 nm from the aerodrome, and 85 seconds before touchdown, control was transferred from the first officer (FO) to the captain, who became the pilot flying (PF). During the approach, the crew rushed to complete the pre-landing checks, visually acquire the runway, and manoeuvre the aircraft to land. The captain turned slightly to the left, away from the runway centreline. At this point, the FO called visual contact with the runway, and the captain turned right, back towards the runway centreline, and again passed through the runway centreline. The captain did not acknowledge that the runway was in sight. The aircraft was configured for landing 25 seconds prior to touchdown. As viewed from the pilot's perspective, the aircraft was to the left of centreline. Several seconds later, the aircraft initiated a right turn to line up with the centreline of runway 19, but actually crossed to the right of the centreline. The aircraft then overflew several buildings on the right of the runway centreline, approximately 75 feet adjacent to the runway threshold. The aircraft then turned sharply to the left as it passed abeam the threshold, then sharply right to acquire the centreline before touching down approximately 2000 feet past the threshold. Immediately after touchdown, the aircraft veered left into the snow bank. During the last 23 seconds of the flight, the FO broadcast a traffic advisory to indicate that the aircraft was on final, made 3 speed calls, and advised the captain that the runway was to the left. There were no remarks made by the captain since the request for the landing checklist. The FO did not declare an unstable approach, or prompt the captain to execute a missed approach. Findings as to causes and contributing factors: 1. Although the hazardous runway condition had been identified by the company's safety management system, the delay in action to mark the runway allowed this condition to persist. 2. Up-to-date weather and runway condition information was not provided to the crew, nor was it requested by the crew. 3. The pilot continued the approach below the visibility limits specified in the company's standard operating procedures. 4. Deteriorating weather, as well as the lack of approach aids and runway markings, hampered the pilot's ability to establish the aircraft onto a stable final approach prior to crossing the threshold. 5. The company's standard operating procedures for stabilized approaches were not followed, and an unstabilized approach was allowed to continue. 6. The pilot was unable to position the aircraft over the centre of the runway as it settled to land, and the left main landing gear entered the deeper snow at the runway edge, causing the aircraft to veer into the snow bank. Findings as to risk: 1. If a company's risk mitigation strategy is not implemented in a timely manner, hazards are allowed to persist, increasing the risk of an accident. 2. If company standard operating procedures do not include criteria and procedures for stabilized approaches, or they are not followed, there is an increased risk of landing accidents. 3. Operating on a snow-covered runway that does not have markings or devices to allow a pilot to easily identify the runway surface increases the risk of runway excursions. 4. If the identified risks and mitigation strategies are not communicated to the people exposed to the risks, it is possible they will deem the risk as acceptable to management and continue operations.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A12P0034 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) TSB; Blue River Airport, BC; March 2012 photo (c) TSB; Blue River Airport, BC; March 2012 photo (c) TSB; Blue River Airport, BC; 17 March 2012 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The danger of a collision was initiated when the flight crew in the SAS aircraft initiated a pushback without clearance being obtained from the control tower. The risk of a collision developed into an aviation accident because there was no room for simultaneous pushback and taxiing, as the infrastructure on the south side of the main terminal does not have a pushback zone, and because no other persons saw the danger of a collision. The SAS pilots were in the process of completing a training program, LIFUS (Line flying under supervision).

The risk of a collision developed into an aviation accident because there was no room for simultaneous pushback and taxiing, as the infrastructure on the south side of the main terminal does not have a pushback zone, and because no other persons saw the danger of a collision. The SAS pilots were in the process of completing a training program, LIFUS (Line flying under supervision). The AIBN believes that the change of role and additional workload for the pilots in connection with the implementation of the training program had a negative effect on the pilots' performance.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIBN Report number: SL 2013/09 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  18 May 2014 LN-NON Norwegian 0 near ZÃ¼rich min Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

None of the 296 passengers and 12 crew were injured. The captain on the flight was Pilot Monitoring, the co-pilot was Pilot Flying. The en route and descent parts of the flight were uneventful. The right main landing gear touched down at about 610 m from the runway 34L threshold with a pitch angle of 3.3 degrees and vertical acceleration of 1.27 G. After that, the captain gave large pitch-up and pitch-down control inputs to assist the control of the copilot, and the vertical acceleration of the aircraft fluctuated significantly twice. Due to these changes in vertical acceleration, the captain felt that the aircraft had bounced and was floating, although this was not the case. At this time the speed brakes had activated and the reverse thrust was being applied, but the captain did not notice this. The captain diverted his attention to look outside of the aircraft to confirm its attitude, and then judged to make a go-around. When he noticed that the reversers had been activated, he still decided to continue the go around, although the AOM calls for a full stop landing when reversers have been activated. The captain called for a go around three times but the TO/GA switch could not be activated by the co-pilot because the reversers were selected. The captain then called ""I have control"" and took over controls. All the time the airplane had been rolling on the runway in a nose up attitude, causing a tailstrike. The go around was continued and the airplane landed safely at 16:35. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""In this accident, it is highly probable that the Aircraft continued rolling with the pitch-up attitude after touchdown, causing the aft fuselage to come into contact with the runway and be damaged. It is highly probable that the Aircraft continued rolling with the pitch-up attitude due to the following reasons: after touchdown, the PIC had felt that the Aircraft had bounced to the extent necessary for go-around, and judged to make go-around to avoid a hard landing; even after he became aware that the reverse thrust levers had been raised, he continued go-around; hence, it took time for the engine thrust to increase and he continued to pull his control column. Moreover, it is somewhat likely that, in a situation in which the PIC had been assisting the control of the FO, and without the PICÂs declaring a takeover, the intention of the PIC was not properly conveyed to the FO, the sharing of duties between PF and PM became momentarily unclear, and the monitoring of flight information such as pitch angle and speed, which was the duty of PM, was not performed adequately.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JTSB Report number: AA2014-8 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Flight 120 took off from Tyumen Airport runway 21 on a regular domestic passenger flight to Surgut (SGC). The ATR-72 climbed to a height of 210 m and then banked 35Â° left, followed by a 50Â° right hand bank. It then struck a snowy field approx. 1,6 km past the end of the runway, broke up and a fire erupted. The Interstate Aviation Committee stated that both engines were working properly at the time of the accident.  The Federal Air Transport Agency reported that the airplane had been parked outside for eight hours in weather conditions which included snow and temperatures at and just below freezing level. The airplane was not de-iced prior to departure and the crew did not insist on being de-iced. Causes: The immediate cause of the ATR 72-201 VP-BYZ aircraft accident was the PIC's decision to takeoff without de/anti-icing treatment despite the fact that snow and ice deposits were present on aircraft surface and were discovered by the crew members during taxi which resulted in degradation of aircraft aerodynamic performance and stall during climbing after takeoff as well as inability of the crew to recognize stall and, consequently, failure to undertake recovery procedure. The aircraft stall occurred at the operational angles of attack right after flaps retraction with engaged autopilot before stall warning system activation and was caused by the loss of the wing lift effectiveness due to takeoff with non-removed ground icing. The system cause of the accident were shortcomings in ground handling activities and staff training in UTAir-Technik that became possible because of absence of due monitoring by the Technical and Operation Supervising Directorates of UTAir airline for compliance with airline requirements regarding ground handling and aircraft ground icing protection which resulted in erroneous evaluation of aircraft conditions by the PIC and aircraft mechanic (the shift head kept himself aloof from monitoring mechanic's activities) after the aircraft has been on ground in icing conditions for a long time and in release the aircraft to fly without de/anti-icing treatment. The contributing factors were: - The shortcomings in the UTAir safety management system, which contains, all in all, general issues only and is not adopted for the implementation of Airline activities in particular areas, which did not allow to reveal and correct existing safety risks in a timely manner. - The shortcomings in the UTAir-Technic quality management system, resulted in neglecting of certain requirements of the UTAir ground handling management manual regarding staff training and monitoring for aircraft de/anti-icing treatment which led to the situation when not sufficiently-qualified staff performed the evaluation of the aircraft surface conditions and made the decision on need for the aircraft to be de-iced/anti-iced. - The absence at the time of the accident of basic regulations in force that establish state requirements for ground handling (de/anti-icing treatment in particular) including staff training and organization licensing. - The shortcomings in crewmembers initial and recurrent training as far as the danger of ground icing, its influence on the aircraft aerodynamic performance together with aircraft anti-icing system operation features and design are concerned that did not allow the crew to make the only appropriate decision to return for de-icing/anti-icing treatment after the observation of the snow and ice contamination on the wing after anti-icing system activation in de-icing mode while taxiing for takeoff. - The methodological imperfection of the crew computer based and simulator training programs concerning the prevention of aircraft stall, identification of approach to stall and taking timely actions for recovery. - The increasing need for number of flight crews to perform highly growing flights schedule which, with ineffective SMS, resulted in flight instructor work deficiencies during PIC training and absence of PIC skills to take correct decisions and to strictly comply with the regulations in force. - The possible fatigue of the crew members due to the violation of the work and rest balance while performing split flight shifts together with a large number of unused days-off.METAR: 01:30 UTC / 07:30 local time: USTR 020130Z 24006G09MPS 9999 BKN013CB M01/M01 Q1002 TEMPO 26015MPS 1500 SHSN BLSN BKN005 RMK QFE742/0989 21290060 30750029Wind 6 m/s (gusting to 9 m/s) at 240 degrees; Visibility: 10 km or more; Clouds: Broken, at 1300 feet above aerodrome level, cumulonimbus; Temperature: -01 degrees Celsius; Dewpoint: -01 degrees Celsius; QNH (Sea-level pressure): 1002 hPa; The following weather phenomena are expected to arise temporarily: Wind: 260 degrees, Speed: 15 m/s; Visibility: 1500 m; Weather: Showers of Snow; Clouds: Broken sky, at 500 feet above aerodrome level; Runway state: Runway 21: wet or water patches, contamination 51% to 100%, deposit less than 1 mm deep, friction coefficient 0.60Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: MAK  UTAir  SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) State Ministry of Emergency Situations of Russia in the Tyumen region; near Tyumen Airport (TJM/USTR); 02 April 2012 photo (c) State Ministry of Emergency Situations of Russia in the Tyumen region; near Tyumen Airport (TJM/USTR); 02 April 2012 photo (c) State Ministry of Emergency Situations of Russia in the Tyumen region; near Tyumen Airport (TJM/USTR); 02 April 2012 photo (c) MAK; near Tyumen Airport (TJM/USTR); 02 April 2012 photo (c) MAK; near Tyumen Airport (TJM/USTR); 02 April 2012 photo (c) MAK; near Tyumen Airport (TJM/USTR); 02 April 2012 photo (c) MAK photo (c) MAK photo (c) MAK photo (c) MAK photo (c) MAK photo (c) Konstantin Nikiforov; October 2009 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates19-Oct-2024 18:56 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

In accordance with abnormal procedures checklists, and guidance from the company, the crew elected to use the Alternate Landing Gear Extension checklist to prepare for landing at the destination After pulling the main gear release handle and the nose gear release handle the crew observed that the main landing gear indicated down and locked with green indicator lights, the nose landing gear did not indicate down and locked, and the red Nose Gear Unsafe light was illuminated.  The crew landed the airplane with the main landing gear down and the nose landing gear retracted, and the airplane came to rest on the main gear and forward fuselage on the runway. Post-accident, the nose gear was successfully extended multiple times using the alternate extension handle and the landing gear was also extended multiple times under hydraulic power with no anomalies noted.  Testing of landing gear system components did not reveal any failures that should have prevented the gear from extending via the alternate extension method.  The pull force required to extend the nose gear alternate release handle to a position where the nose gear released from the up and locked position was measured at approximately 72 lbs. According to manufacturer's design requirements, the pull length on the alternate release handle should be approximately 11 inches with a force of 90 pounds. A post-accident review of the alternate gear extension procedures was conducted in a full flight simulator by the investigation group with the participation of the accident flight crew.  The pull force required and the pull length required to extend the nose gear using the alternate extension handle was determined to be significantly lower in the flight simulator as compared to the aircraft. There was no guidance contained in the alternate landing gear extension procedure specifying required pull forces when using the alternate extension handle. Subsequent to the accident, the manufacturer added details to the alternate landing gear extension procedure in the Airplane Flight Manual regarding the maximum pull forces that a pilot may experience when the alternate extension handle is pulled. Probable Cause: the nose landing gear alternate release handle was not pulled with sufficient enough force or distance to release the uplocks and allow extension of the nose landing gear. Contributing to the accident was the dissimilar pull force and pull length set on the flight simulator that was used for flight crew training of alternate landing gear extension procedures and the lack of information available to crew members advising of the dissimilar pull force.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA12FA058 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  4 July 2012 N213WQ United Express, opb Colgan Air 0 Houston-George Bush Intercontinental Airport, TX (IAH) sub Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates03-Apr-2014 16:09 Katonk2014 Added 21-Dec-2016 19:28 ASN Update Bot Updated [Time, Damage, Category, Investigating agency, ]27-Nov-2017 20:37 ASN Update Bot Updated [Operator, Other fatalities, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

They were then scheduled to return, with passengers, to London-Gatwick Airport (LGW). An onboard hand-held Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) HP iPAQ computer was used to calculate the takeoff performance data. Once this was completed, the EFB was placed in the standby mode. The flight to Chambery was uneventful and the aircraft landed at 09:15, 15 minutes behind schedule. The return flight to Gatwick was scheduled to depart at 10:00. The pre-flight preparations proceeded normally and the pilots reported no distractions other than those normally experienced during a turnaround. The co-pilot, who was the non-handling pilot for this flight, completed the manual load sheet whilst the commander programmed the route into the Flight Management Computer (FMC). The commander reported that he then cross-checked the load sheet information and, having ensured it was correct, entered the Zero Fuel Weight (ZFW) into the FMC. The FMC then calculated the Takeoff Weight (TOW) using the fuel weight automatically retained in the system. The commander read back the FMC calculated TOW to the co-pilot, who cross-checked it against the load sheet data and confirmed that they agreed. Having loaded the ZFW into the FMC and cross-checked the TOW, the commander used the EFB computer to calculate the takeoff performance data. This involved waking up the EFB from the standby mode, then entering the airfield, weather and aircraft data, which included the flap position for takeoff. A specific flap setting could be entered, or the computer could be used to provide an optimum setting. The commander stated that he normally entered Flap 5 for the takeoff performance calculation. However, at airports where performance was considered to be more critical, he would set the performance computer to select the optimum setting. As the runway at Chambery is relatively short, the commander chose the optimum flap position calculated by the performance computer. This gave a selection of Flap 1 which, under the circumstances, he did not consider unusual. Similarly, the computed takeoff speeds did not seem unusual to the commander, particularly as they were predicated on a flap setting he did not normally use. The computed figures, based on the data entered on the EFB, allowed for a reduced thrust takeoff. The calculated assumed temperature to be set to achieve this did not seem unreasonable at the time, although the commander stated that, in hindsight, he considered it to be too high for the airfield and the prevailing conditions. Both pilots stated that they would normally cross-check the performance figures once they had been calculated on the EFB. However, on this occasion, and for reasons the pilots could not recall, this was not done. The commander wrote the speeds he had computed using the EFB on the flight paperwork and then entered them into the FMC, overwriting the FMC generated speeds. The commander stated that this was standard practice and on this occasion he did not take note of any difference between the two sets of speeds. The rest of the pre-flight preparation was completed and the aircraft took off from runway 36 at Chambery at 10:08 UTC (12:08 local time), on schedule, with 131 passengers onboard. The pilots reported the weather at the time was good, with a light wind from the east, good visibility and dry conditions. The ATIS reported a temperature of 8Â°C and a QNH of 999 hPa. On takeoff both pilots felt a slight judder, which they considered was due to turbulence from the preceding aircraft. Early in the climb they received a call on the intercom from the rear cabin station informing them that the cabin crew to the rear of the aircraft had also felt a judder. This call was intended for the cabin purser at the front of the cabin, but was mistakenly made to the flight deck. The pilots reassured the cabin crew member, still believing the judder was due to turbulence. Their opinion was reinforced by the absence of any abnormal flight deck indications or calls from ATC at Chambery to the contrary. The remainder of the flight went without incident and the aircraft landed at Gatwick at 11:30. The aircraft was taxied to stand and, after shutting down, the pilots were informed by ground personnel that the underside of the rear fuselage had sustained damage consistent with a tailstrike. This prompted the crew to reconsider the cause of the judder felt at takeoff and they reviewed the takeoff performance data. This revealed that the commander had omitted to enter the aircraft's TOW into the EFB computer at Chambery, with the result that the computer had reverted to the previous TOW data retained from Stansted to calculate the takeoff performance figures.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: AAIB Bulletin: 4/2013 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 12 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) AAIB; London-Gatwick Airport (LGW/EGKK); April 2012 photo (c) AAIB Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Of the 98 passengers and crew onboard, two flight attendants received serious injuries and one passenger received minor injuries during the encounter. The flight was operating under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 as a regularly scheduled passenger flight between Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (KPHX), Phoenix, Arizona, and Denver International Airport (KDEN), Denver, Colorado. According to the operator, the captain was the pilot monitoring, and the first officer (FO) was the pilot flying. The flight was cleared to descend from FL390 to 17,000 feet. The seatbelt sign was on during the descent and there were no pilot reports of turbulence in the area.   The captain turned on the weather radar and noted no returns present between the airplane and the airport. As the airplane passed through about FL320, the captain noticed the airspeed rapidly increasing.  He disconnected the autopilot while simultaneously notifying the FO of the overspeed and began to apply a nose-up input. The FO also began to command a nose-up input at that time and so the captain released his pitch up input. The crew received an overspeed warning and then encountered severe turbulence. The flight crew stated the encounter lasted about 10 â 15 seconds. After the encounter, both Elevator and Aileron Computers (ELAC) faults were displayed. The FO resumed pilot flying duties while the Captain performed the appropriate actions to reset ELAC 1 and 2, report the encounter to air traffic control and dispatch, and contacted the flight attendants.  The A flight attendant (A-FA) was in the forward jumpseat and the B flight attendant (B-FA) and C flight attendant (C-FA) were in the aft galley sitting in their jumpseats without their seatbelts on. During the turbulence encounter, both aft flight attendants struck the overhead ceiling,  panels before landing on the floor. Two passengers who were also not wearing their seatbelts were lifted out of their seats and struck the ceiling panels during the encounter. Oxygen masks in several rows of seats were also released as a result of the turbulence. Two onboard medical personnel tended to the B-FA and C-FA with the assistance of the A-FA.   The captain declared a medical emergency and arranged for emergency personnel to meet the flight on arrival. At the gate, paramedics transported the two injured flight attendants and one of the injured passengers to the hospital. Probable Cause: an inadvertent encounter with mountain wave turbulence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA12CA062 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 years and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  28 May 2019 N808AW American Airlines 0 TorontoâLester B.

All three crew members survived without injuries. The aircraft had taken-off from Lokichoggio, Kenya at 11:03 hours for a flight destined for Yida, South Sudan. While at 16,000 feet, approximately 100 miles from Yida, the no. 2 engine reportedly ceased. A restart was attempted and this was successful, but shortly after, the engine ceased again. The crew then opted to proceed to Yida on one engine while monitoring their descent rate. The rest of the flight was uneventful until touchdown at Yida. Shortly after commencing their landing roll, the crew heard a thud. The aircraft assumed a nose down attitude. Shortly thereafter, the nose gear collapsed. The aircraft was still rolling down the runway, with dust and other debris entering the cockpit from the damaged nose gear section. The aircraft eventually came to a stop, the pilot monitoring exited through the emergency exit. He was followed by the flight engineer and Pilot in command exited last. There was neither reported fire nor injuries. The engine just had 20 hours of service since overhaul. The nose gear broke as a result of a hairline fracture in the nose gear assembly, according to the operator.Sources: Airnieuws  Sky Relief   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

It was climbing through an altitude of about FL220 when the crew decided to return to LGW. The emergency return was initiated because of a report of smoke in the cabin. The airplane was evacuated on the runway. First report of the cause of the incident reports technical problem caused a spurious fire warning. There was no fire & no smoke on board.  According to the summary if the incident from the AAIB:  ""The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) was notified of this occurrence by Virgin Atlantic Airways shortly after it happened and the investigation was started the same day. The occurrence was initially classified by the AAIB as a Serious Incident. However, when it became clear that two passengers had incurred injuries defined as Serious, the occurrence was reclassified as an Accident, in accordance with ICAO Annex 13 and the United Kingdomâs âCivil Aviation (Investigation of Air Accidents and Incidents) Regulations 1996â. This classification as an Accident does not reflect the state of the aircraft, which sustained only very minor damage, during the evacuation. In accordance with established international arrangements, the Bureau dâEnquÃªtes et dâAnalyses (BEA) in France, representing the State of Design and Manufacture of the aircraft, appointed an Accredited Representative and was supported by a team which included advisors from Airbus, the aircraft manufacturer, and Siemens, systems manufacturer. The aircraft operator has co-operated with the investigation and provided expertise as required. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) have been kept informed of developments. The aircraft was operating a flight from London Gatwick Airport to McCoy International Airport in Orlando, USA with three flight crew, 10 cabin crew and 304 passengers on board including three infants. Early in the flight the crew received a series of smoke warnings from the aft cargo hold and the commander elected to return to London Gatwick. The crew carried out the appropriate emergency drills, including the discharge of the fire extinguishers in the aft cargo hold, but the smoke warnings continued. The aircraft landed safely, the crew brought it to a halt on the runway and endeavoured to establish the extent of any fire. This produced conflicting evidence and, with smoke warnings continuing, the commander ordered an emergency evacuation. The passengers all left the aircraft within 90 seconds but two injuries, classed as âSeriousâ, were incurred. Subsequent examination of the aircraft and its systems showed that the smoke warnings had been spurious. The investigation identified that injuries were sustained during the evacuation of the aircraft. The evacuation was initiated based on the commanderâs assessment of the available sources of information, including the repetitive and intermittent nature of the aft cargo smoke warnings. The investigation identified the following causal factor for the intermittent cargo smoke warnings: A latent fault on the T1 thermistor channel of smoke detector 10WH, in combination with a CAN Bus fault and possible high levels of humidity in the cargo compartment due to the carriage of perishable goods, provided circumstances sufficient to generate multiple spurious aft cargo compartment smoke warnings. The investigation identified the following contributory factors for the intermittent cargo smoke warnings: The thermal channel fault in 10WH was not detected prior to the event by the internal smoke detector temperature monitoring. The proximity of the fire extinguisher nozzles to the smoke detectors"".

Bhoja Airlines flight B4213 departed Karachi (KHI) at 17:05 on a domestic flight to Islamabad (ISB). This was the inaugural evening flight for the airline on this route. The flight climbed to a cruising altitude of FL310 and continued towards Islamabad. Weather at the destination was poor due to a passing thunderstorm. At 18:19 the captain at a distance observed the squall line. Moments later the flight was cleared to descend to FL200. During the descent the captain and first officer discussed the weather. They were worried about the severity of the thunderstorm ahead. At 18:26 the first officer contacted Islamabad Approach and received clearance for the One Foxtrot arrival for an ILS approach to runway 30. After receiving further descent clearance the first officer discussed opportunities to approach the airfield through a gap in the squall line. The Approach controller gave radar vectors and descent instructions to fly through the gap in the storm. At 18:35, Islamabad Approach gave a weather update and said ""Bhoja 213 surface wind at Islamabad ah is varying between 180Â° to 270Â°, 10 kts and ah sometimes gusting to 20 kts and runway condition is wet, light drizzle is ah uhm going on, braking action not known"". Two minutes later the airplane entered the squall line. Although the Bhoja Air Operational Manual prohibited flight in these conditions, the captain decided to continue. The airplane was configured for the approach with flaps and slats selected and the undercarriage was down. The first officer then reported the speed to be 220 knots, which was 30 knots higher than the recommended speed. The captain reacted surprised as he did not expect this because the he was flying with the auto-throttle engaged. Likely the increase in speed was a result of windshear. The aircraft then entered the active weather cell with precipitation continuing in varying intensity. At 18:39 the airplane captured the ILS and descended on the glide slope. At this point the aircraft should have been in landing configuration with flaps at 30Â°. However, only flaps 5 were selected.  The aircraft then encountered an increasing downdraft. The pitch attitude increased and computed airspeed decreased as the autopilot attempted to maintain the glide slope. The GPWS consequently sounded with the aural alarm: ""Wind shear - Wind shear - Wind shear"". Although the first officer anxiously called for a go around, no action was taken. The downdraft dissipated and the pitch attitude decreased but the aircraft deviated left of the extended runway centerline, and was brought back by the captain. At that moment the autopilot disconnected due to the aircraft deviation beyond the autopilot maximum authority limits. The auto throttle remained engaged in IAS speed mode. Following autopilot disconnect, there was no control wheel activity recorded for approximately 6 seconds and no control column activity for approximately 8 seconds. The crew were likely confused. During this period of control inactivity, the aircraft deviated below the glide slope.  Then the Terrain Awareness Warning System (TAWS) alarm sounded: ""Whoop, Whoop, Whoop"". No action was taken by either crew member. A few seconds later the aircraft entered another downdraft and the rate of descent increased rapidly. The TAWS alarm sounded again, directing the crew to ""pull up"". The captain responded with a nose-up column input. However, pressure altitude and thrust continued to decrease. The downdraft dissipated rapidly, resulting in a rapid increase in angle of attack of the aircraft, which activated the stick shaker for almost 2 seconds. It appeared that captain lowered the nose down to get out of stick shaker regime however, proper and complete Boeing recommended stall and recovery procedures were not carried out. This resulted in a 12Â° nose down pitch. Then another windshear alarm sounded, followed by another stick shaker activation. The first officer shouted to ""get out"" and ""go around"" but the attempts by the captain failed as he did not apply the proper procedures to execute a go around. Shortly after initial ground contact, the aircraft struck a steeply sloped terrace about 5 meters high which resulted in significant structural breakup of the aircraft structure. The ineffective automated flight deck management in extreme adverse weather conditions by cockpit crew caused the accident. The ineffective automated flight deck management was due to various factors including; incorrect selection of cockpit crew on account of their inadequate flying experience, training and competence level for Boeing 737-236A (advanced version of Boeing 737-200 series), absence of formal simulator training in respect of FO for handling an automated flight deck, non-existence of cockpit crew professional competence / skill level monitoring system at operator level (Bhoja Air). The cockpit crew incorrect decision to continue the flight for destination and non-adherence to Boeing recommended QRH and FCOM remedial actions /procedures due to non-availability of customized aircraft documents (at Bhoja Air) for Boeing 737-236A (advanced version of Boeing 737-200 series) contributed towards the causation of accident. The inability of CAA Pakistan to ensure automated flight deck variance type training and monitoring requirements primarily due to incorrect information provided by the Bhoja Air Management was also a contributory factor in causation of the accident.METAR: 13:00 UTC / 18:00 local time: OPRN 201300Z 23020KT 4000 TS FEW025CB SCT030 BKN100 25/15 Q1009.3/29.8014:00 UTC / 19:00 local time: OPRN 201400Z 23020KT 3000 TSRA FEW025CB SCT030 BKN100 20/16 Q1011.0/29.85Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: PakCAA Report number: SIB-350 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) Timo Blossfeld; Johannesburg-O.R.

The plane began to sink into the ground with the subsequent nose over. According to the findings of the commission of inquiry, the cause of the accident was a coincidence of the following factors:  - failure of the crew to use the full length of the airstrip during the takeoff of the aircraft;  - late decision of the aircraft commander to stop take-off during the rolling of the aircraft outside the runway;  - change of wind direction to the opposite (tailwind) during the takeoff of the aircraftSources: State Aviation Service of Ukraine Accident Analysis 2012  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane touched down smoothly on the main landing gear (MLG) and then touched down on the nose landing gear (NLG). The PIC had his hand on the thrust reversers when he and the SIC heard the landing gear unsafe horn; the left MLG then collapsed followed immediately by the collapse of the right MLG and the NLG. The airplane slid on its belly for about 1,500 ft before it came to rest on the runway. Cockpit voice recorder data confirmed that the unsafe landing gear configuration warning did not occur before touchdown as reported by the PIC.    Postaccident examination revealed that, although the landing gear handle was in the down-and-locked position, all of the landing gear were fully retracted and engaged in their respective uplocks. Extensive testing of the airplane's hydraulic and electrical systems did not reveal any malfunctions that would have resulted in an uncommanded gear retraction. Some small, fine particulate matter was observed within the hydraulic manifold assembly; however, testing was unable to determine if these particles contributed to the uncommanded landing gear retraction. Probable Cause: An uncommanded landing gear retraction after touchdown for reasons that could not be determined because postaccident examination did not reveal any mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were no injuries. The airplane operated on a ferry flight from Madina (MED), Saudi Arabia carrying ten crew members. The visibility at Jeddah was good with a few clouds present. During the initial ILS approach to runway 16R, while at 8 nautical miles and 2600 feet, the landing gear handle was lowered. Both main landing gears extended and locked down and, the nose gear doors opened but the nose landing gear did not lower. The captain who was then the Pilot Monitoring (PM) took over the controls and carried out a missed approach. The First Officer (FO) became the Pilot Monitoring (PM). SVA 2865 was then given an area to the northeast of Jeddah to carry out attempts at lowering the nose gear. The flight crew attempted to manually free fall the nose landing gear at least ten times. The nose landing gear would not lower into the locked position, but the nose gear doors remained open during all those attempts. As a precautionary measure, SVA 2865 performed a fly-by of runway 16R at 500 ft. The air traffic controller confirmed that the nose landing gear was not down. SVA 2865 was vectored over the Red Sea to lower the fuel load, thus reducing the landing weight. During this period, the Fire & Rescue Services (FRS) at Jeddah foamed a portion of runway 16L between taxiway Kilo 5 (K5) and K2.  SVA 2865 was vectored for an instrument approach for runway 16L. The Auto Pilot and the Auto Throttle Systems were OFF. The surface winds were from 220Â° at 12 knots (kt), gusting to 19 kt and the temperature was +37 Celsius (Â°C). The flight crew used the ""Landing with Nose Landing Gear Abnormal"" checklist ensuring the aircraft was properly prepared and configured for the approach, the before landing, the flare and the touchdown sequences, including when the aircraft stopped and the necessary procedures to secure the aircraft before evacuation. The aircraft landed on its main landing gear 4000 ft past the threshold of runway 16L. The nose of the aircraft was slowly lowered to the runway with the nose landing gear doors touching the runway within the foamed area 4500 ft from the end of runway 16L. The front of the fuselage then touched the runway within the last portion of foam, 3500 ft from the end of runway 16L. The nose area of the aircraft slid on the runway, where sparks were present until the aircraft came to a full stop 1500 ft prior to the end of runway 16L. There was no fire. Cause Related Findings: 1. The NLG up-lock contained a spring, Part Number GA71102 that was broken as a result of fatigue initiated at the third coil of the spring. 2. The spring had been broken for a prolonged period of time, as noted by the spring linear wear marks on the outside area of the spring coils. 3. Damage observed on the NLG up-lock resulted from hard contact with the broken spring during normal NLG operation. 4. The fracture process of the spring was initiated at the third coil level. At least 6000 cycles of fatigue (number of striations) have been estimated by fatigue striation measurements. The crack on the spring started on the internal surface of the spring which was not shot peened. 5. The normal and free fall extensions of the NLG failed due to a mechanical blockage created by the broken spring jammed against the cam.Sources: Report AIB-2013-0002 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  17 April 2012 TC-OAG Onur Air 1 Amman-Queen Alia International Airport (AMM/OJAI) non Location  Images: photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS/EHAM); 03 May 2008 photo (c) Timo Blossfeld; Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS/EHAM); 11 August 2007 photo (c) Willem GÃ¶ebel; Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS/EHAM) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All 45 on board were killed.  A flight plan had been filed for an IFR flight from Halim Airport to Pelabuhan Ratu area then return to Halim Airport.  The flight departed Jakarta-Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport (HLP/WIHH) at 14:21. It flew south and circled Mount Salak (elevation 7254 feet). After circling the mountain, the airplane began to descend from 10,000 feet to 6,000 feet. Last contact with the flight was at 14:30. The wreckage was found the following morning on a near-vertical mountainside on the eastern side of Mount Salak at an elevation of 6,100 feet.  The Superjet was conducting a demonstration flight to prospective customers in several countries. Demonstrations were flown in Myanmar, Pakistan and Kazakhstan before arriving in Indonesia on May 9. Two demonstration flights were planned. The first flight was uneventful. Passengers on the second flight were reporters and representatives of several Indonesian airlines. There were six crew members on board, two representatives of Sukhoi and 37 journalists and prospective clients. FACTORS: a. The crew were not aware of the mountainous area surrounding the flight path due to various factors resulting in disregarding the TAWS warning.  b. The Jakarta Radar service had not established the minimum vectoring altitudes and the system was not equipped with functioning MSAW for the particular area surrounding Mount Salak.  c. Distraction to the flight crew from prolonged conversation not related to the progress of the flight resulted in the pilot flying did not continue to change the aircraft heading while in orbit. Consequently, the aircraft unintentionally exited the orbit.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSC Report number: KNKT.12.05.09.04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: BBC  sergeydolya.livejournal.com  Ministry of Transportation, Indonesia  SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) NTSC; Jakarta-Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport (HLP/WIHH); 09 May 2012 photo (c) NTSC; Jakarta-Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport (HLP/WIHH); 09 May 2012 photo (c) NTSC; Jakarta-Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport (HLP/WIHH); 09 May 2012 photo (c) Sergey Dolya; Jakarta-Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport (HLP/WIHH); 09 May 2012 photo (c) Sergey Dolya; Jakarta-Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport (HLP/WIHH); 09 May 2012 photo (c) Andi; Jakarta-Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport (HLP/WIHH); 09 May 2012 photo (c) Andi; Jakarta-Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport (HLP/WIHH); 09 May 2012 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates19-Oct-2024 19:00 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight was descending through 12,400 feet about 45 miles west of FLL at the time of the encounter.  The airplane was not damaged. The flight crew reported that on initial descent into the Fort Lauderdale area they noticed typical Florida summertime cumulus cloud conditions.  About 20 minutes before the event, the Captain appropriately briefed the flight attendants to prepare the cabin for landing early and to be seated after completing the initial clean-up. The flight crew subsequently illuminated the seat belt sign during the descent.  The flight attendants were still in the process of preparing the cabin for landing when the turbulence was encountered. During descent, the airplane passed in and out of cloud formations.  The crew described, and CVR data is consistent with, passing out of a cloud and noticing a larger developing cumulus in front of them.  The autopilot and autothrust were engaged.  The crew reported that the radar did not indicate any echoes ahead of them.  The Airbus weather radar system includes a Turbulence detection function, which was not used by the crew.  The Airbus flight crew training manual describes effective mode, range, and tilt settings for detecting âwetâ (convective) turbulence.  As the airplane passed into the cumulus development, the airplane encountered convectively induced turbulence, resulting in a peak vertical acceleration of about  2 G and -0.5 G.  The activity was likely developing upwards, possibly below the field of view of the radar, and into the flight path. As a result of the injuries to the forward flight attendant, the flight crew advised ATC that they had an injured crew member and requested priority handling and for paramedics to meet the airplane on arrival.  The ATC approach controller did not forward the request for paramedics.  The crew also attempted to contact the company station agents and dispatch, but received no response.  The lack of ATC coordination, and lack of company personnel to monitor communications from inbound flights, delayed the arrival of emergency medical personnel to meet the flight. Probable Cause: an inadvertent encounter with convectively induced turbulence developing upwards into the flight path, which was not detected on weather radar as configured by the crew. Contributing to the delay in emergency medical personnel notification was the incomplete coordination of paramedic response by air traffic control and ineffective communications monitoring by Frontier Airlines.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA12FA069 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 years and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates07-Feb-2018 13:49 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

It was a regular public transport flight that had been planned to refuel at Sasereme and continue to Balimo and on to Daru. For the flight to Sasereme, the pilot in command (PIC) was the support/monitoring pilot, and the copilot was the handling pilot. The aircraft arrived over the Saserema airstrip at 02:40. While en-route, the crew was informed by the company flight operations staff that it had been raining at Sasereme throughout the previous night until morning, but the prevailing weather was fine. The flight was being conducted under the visual flight rules (VFR) procedures. The copilot had not flown into Sasereme before, so this was a training flight for her. During the cruise before top of descent, the crew discussed the approach and landing requirements. Because of the wet, slippery and rough airstrip surface conditions and a landing weight of 5,300 kg, they agreed on a 30 degrees flap settings and a approach speed of 73 knots. The weather, as observed by the crew, was sunny and fine with few clouds around and the wind was estimated to be light and variable (2 to 3 kt) even though there was no wind sock available to indicate the actual wind velocity. The crew opted to land on strip 14 and joined the circuit on left downwind. Passing through 50 ft the copilot flared the aircraft and it floated in ground effect. As the main landing gear touched down on the centreline of the strip it skipped, became airborne and stayed in ground effect for at least another 20 m. On the second touchdown the aircraft yawed to the left and at that point the PIC took over the controls and applied full reverse thrust. He applied right rudder to regain the centreline, but at the same time the left main landing gear started impacting the ruts in the surface of the strip, severely degrading directional control. The PIC subsequently reported that at that point he felt it was not safe to apply power for an aborted landing. He moved the left power lever out of reverse while keeping full reverse and right rudder input on the right engine and began pulsing the brakes. The left main wheel continued impacting more ruts as the aircraft decelerated. Eventually the left main wheel hit a deep rut pulling the aircraft sharply to the left off the runway. That partially dislodged the landing gear from the airframe causing the left wing to impact the ground. The aircraft came to rest about 5 m from the edge of the airstrip. The PIC shut down the engines while the copilot assisted the passengers from aircraft through the right rear cabin door. The investigation determined that the decision to operate into Sasereme on a scheduled air service, without knowing the serviceability of the strip, was a safety deficiency in the operation of the aircraft and contributory factor in the accident. The PIC did not provide the copilot with the opportunity to observe an approach and landing at Sasereme before allowing her to handle a landing there as pilot flying. The PIC's late decision to take control of the aircraft from the copilot and execute a go-around was also a contributory factor.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIC PNG Report number: AIC 12-1005 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) PNG AIC; Sasereme Airstrip; May 2012 photo (c) PNG AIC; Sasereme Airstrip; May 2012 photo (c) PNG AIC; Sasereme Airstrip; May 2012 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight crew reported that the airplane was about 60 pounds over its maximum weight for takeoff. Since their taxi to the assigned runway was long, they decided to reduce weight by using higher-than-normal engine power settings while maintaining some amount of braking to control speed while taxiing in order to burn fuel prior to takeoff. During the taxi, the right and left main landing gear tires deflated when the fusible plugs in the wheels blew out due to over-heating, and a fire ignited in the right wheel housing. The crew reported that they felt the airplane yaw as the tires deflated and were informed via radio by a following airplane that their right wheel was on fire. The crew brought the airplane to a stop on the taxiway, evacuated, and attempted to extinguish the fire with two hand-held fire extinguishers.

The pilot declared an emergency, diverted to a nearby airport, and landed without further incident. The separated passenger door was subsequently found on a nearby golf course.  The co-pilot reported in a written statement that he closed the main passenger door and checked for a green light to ensure that it was secure. In a subsequent interview, he reported that he ""believed"" that the door warning lights were working, but he could not positively recall seeing the ""Door Safe"" light illuminated after closing the door. He also did not remember activating the ""Recall"" switch before takeoff.  Ramp security video showed that the main passenger door appeared to close; it then re-opened momentarily and closed again before the airplane taxied out of the ramp area. The co-pilot reported that he re-closed the door because it did not secure on the first attempt. An examination of the recovered door and the door frame did not reveal evidence of a pre-existing mechanical malfunction or failure that would have precluded normal operation. The top half of the door was crushed from the impact with the ground, which prevented establishing the condition of door rigging before the accident. An examination of the fuselage revealed a skin puncture that matched the location of the door pull-out handle and is consistent with the door being in the open position when the puncture occurred. Although the door's external handle was found in the closed position, smudging on the fuselage was consistent with the handle's movement from the open to the closed position during impact with the fuselage.  Although it is apparent from the cockpit voice recording that the flight crew referenced the pilot checklist at some stages during ground operations, crew challenge and response items were sporadically mentioned. After the sound of the passenger door closing, neither crewmember mentioned the door warning lights. At no point during ground operations through the takeoff sequence were the doors, door warning lights, or master caution system mentioned. The co-pilot mentioned the ""Annunciator"" check in the Before Takeoff checklist; however, no ""Recall"" response was noted on the recording. Activating the recall switch would have alerted the flight crew to an unsecured door before takeoff. Probable Cause: The failure of the co-pilot to properly close and latch the passenger door before departure, and the flight crew's failure to ensure that the door was secure by using the door warning system. Contributing to the accident was the flight crew's inadequate use of checklists.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.
