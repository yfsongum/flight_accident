It went down a dropoff. The aircraft was operating an ambulance flight to pick up a Covid-19 patient. Diamantina Airport has a single asphalt runway (03/21), measuring 1610 x 30 m. Past the paved runway surface of runway 03 there is a 60 m stopway, followed by downsloping terrain. Contributing factors: - Application of controls - contributed. Considering that the distance ahead of the aircraft at the moment of touchdown (600 m) was not sufficient to decelerate and stop the plane within the runway limits, it was found that an inadequacy in the use of flight controls led to a long landing, where, from the touchdown point, there was not enough runway to safely stop the aircraft. - Attitude - undetermined. The fact that the PIC (PM) had already conducted several flights with the SIC (PF) without any issues, as well as their close relationship, may have contributed to an attitude of excessive confidence and resulted in a non-assertive perception of the approach parameters during this phase of the flight. - Cockpit coordination - contributed. The account of the events leading up to the landing indicated that the available human resources for aircraft operation were not adequately utilized, as the PIC (PM) only noticed the deviations that led to this runway excursion on short final, characterizing inefficient cockpit coordination as a contributing factor to the studied accident. - Fatigue - undetermined. Based on the medical examinations conducted after the accident, as well as the overall picture observed by the medical representative, it was inferred that the lack of response from the SIC (PF) to the PIC's (PM) alerts and impairment to his alertness could be indicative of the pilot experiencing fatigue-related effects that may have interfered with his performance. - Perception - contributed. The attempt to land even in the face of an unstable approach characterized an inadequate perception of the risks involved in continuing this procedure under the experienced conditions. - Pilot judgment - contributed. The decision to proceed with the landing, even after conducting an unstable approach to a position where only 600 m of runway would remain for the aircraft to stop, as well as the failure to consider the alternative of a go-around, characterized an inadequate judgment regarding the risks of the operation conducted under the circumstances.Accident investigation:   Report number: A-001/CENIPA/2021 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: g1.globo.com  itatiaia.com.br   Location  Images: photo (c) Corpo de Bombeiros Militar de Minas Gerais; Diamantina Airport, MG (DTI); 02 January 2021 photo (c) Corpo de Bombeiros Militar de Minas Gerais; Diamantina Airport, MG (DTI); 02 January 2021 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot was killed in the accident. The aircraft departed Troutdale Airport, Oregon at 22:08 UTC. After departure, while in contact with  Portland Approach and subsequently Seattle Center, the pilot had problems following the controllers' instructions with regards to  headings and radio frequency. The aircraft was cleared to climb to FL370 by Seattle Center and continued to climb, until 13:28:45, when it reached its highest altitude of 31,000 ft. The airplane began to descend, and remained for the next eight minutes in a spiraling and descending 1-mile radius right turn. The last ADS-B target was recorded at 13:36:27, with the airplane on a northwest heading at an altitude of 3,800 ft. The airplane struck the ground in the Mutton Mountain Range, at an elevation of 3,600 ft.  FAA records did not indicate that the pilot held a type rating for the Citation 560. He had taken Citation 560 training toward the end of 2020 at a training facility in Arizona, however the owner of the facility stated that the pilot had not performed to a level sufficient to be issued a type rating or single pilot exemption.  During the training, he struggled significantly in high workload environments and had difficulty operating the airplaneÂs avionics suite, which had recently been installed. He revealed to a fellow pilot that he preferred to Âhand flyÂ the airplane rather than use the autopilot. Review of historical flight data, and statements provided by acquaintances of the pilot, indicate that this was likely the first time he had flown the airplane on his own.

All 56 passengers and 6 crew members died in the accident. The aircraft, a Boeing 737-500 registered PK-CLC, arrived at Jakarta-Soekarno-Hatta International Airport at 12:11 hours local time after a flight from Pangkal Pinang. The subsequent flight for the aircraft, SJ182, was due to depart at 13:40. Weather at the airport was poor with heavy rainfall and low clouds due to a thunderstorm in de vicinity. This caused a delay in departure. At 14:18 the aircraft was cleared to taxi to runway 25R. Take-off from runway 32R was commenced at 14:35 (07:35 UTC).  At 14:36:46, the pilot contacted the Terminal East (TE) controller and was cleared for an unrestricted climb to FL290. Five seconds later, at altitude of 1,980 feet, the Autopilot (AP) system engaged. At 14:38:42, as the aircraft climbed past 8150 feet, the thrust lever of the left engine started reducing, while the thrust lever of the right engine remained in position. FDR data showed that the left engine N1 was decreasing whereas the right engine N1 remained the same. Nine seconds later flight requested a heading change to 075Â° to avoid weather conditions, which was approved by the TE controller. At 14:40:05, the aircraft reached the highest altitude of about 10,900 feet. The autopilot system disengaged at that point with a heading of 016Â°, the pitch angle was about 4.5Â° nose up, and the aircraft rolled to the left to more than 45Â°. The thrust lever position of the left engine continued decreasing while the right engine thrust lever remained in position. Five seconds later the the autothrottle (A/T) system disengaged and the pitch angle was more than 10Â° nose down. The aircraft had entered a high speed descent and impacted the surface of the sea about 20 seconds later. The wreckage was located and appeared to be distributed across an area of about 80 by 110 meters on the seabed at a depth of approximately 16 meters. The Indonesian NTSC reported on February 10 that the aircraft had a repeating issue the autothrottle in the days before the accident.  On 3 January 2021, a pilot reported that the autothrottle was unserviceable. An engineer rectified the problem by cleaning the autothrottle computerÂs electrical connector. After re-installation, the Built-in Test Equipment (BITE) test result was good.  On 4 January 2021, a pilot again reported that the autothrottle was unserviceable. An engineer tried cleaning the autothrottle computerÂs electrical connector but the problem remained and it was transferred to the Deferred Maintenance Items. On 5 January 2021, an engineer rectified the problem by cleaning the autothrottle Takeoff and Go Around (TOGA) switch and conducted a BITE test on the autothrottle computer. The BITE test result was good. Contributing Factors: - The corrective maintenance processes of the A/T problem were unable to identify the friction or binding within the mechanical system of the thrust lever and resulted in the prolonged and unresolved of the A/T problem. - The right thrust lever did not reduce when required by the A/P to obtain selected rate of climb and aircraft speed due to the friction or binding within the mechanical system, as a result, the left thrust lever compensated by moving further backward which resulted in thrust asymmetry. - The delayed CTSM activation to disengage the A/T system during the thrust asymmetry event due to the undervalued spoiler angle position input resulted in greater power asymmetry. - The automation complacency and confirmation bias might have led to a decrease in active monitoring which resulted in the thrust lever asymmetry and deviation of the flight path were not being monitored. - The aircraft rolled to the left instead of to the right as intended while the control wheel deflected to the right and inadequate monitoring of the EADI might have created assumption that the aircraft was rolling excessively to the right which resulted in an action that was contrary in restoring the aircraft to safe flight parameters. - The absence of the guidance of the national standard for the UPRT, may have contributed to the training program not being adequately implemented to ensure that pilots have enough knowledge to prevent and recover of an upset condition effectively and timely.METAR: 07:00 UTC / 14:00 local time: WIII 090700Z 30007KT 4000 VCTS RA FEW016CB OVC018 25/24 Q1007 NOSIG07:30 UTC / 14:30 local time: WIII 090730Z 30006KT 5000 -RA FEW017CB OVC018 25/24 Q1006 NOSIG08:00 UTC / 15:00 local time: WIII 090800Z 28008KT 4000 -RA BKN016 OVC018 26/24 Q1006 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSC Report number: KNKT.21.01.01.04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Antara  Flightradar24 track   Location  Images: photo (c) Leslie Snelleman; Balikpapan-Sepingan Airport (BPN/WALL); 09 November 2017 photo (c) M.

There were 64 people onboard: 2 flight crewmembers, 12 cabin crewmembers, and 50 passengers.  After entering Nicosia flight information region (LCCC FIR), Cyprus, during descent, the aircraft encountered moderate to severe air turbulence that lasted for approximately three minutes. The turbulence caused injuries to seven occupants.  The en route significant weather chart (SIGWX) contained in the operational flight plan (OFP) forecasted occasional isolated embedded cumulonimbus (CB) clouds affecting Nicosia FIR and Beirut FIR (OLBB). The OFP did not contain any significant meteorological information (SIGMET).  During the preflight briefing, the commander alerted the cabin crew about the possibility of in-flight turbulence during the descent to OLBA. On 17 January 2021, Larnaca International Airport (LCLK) meteorological watch office (MWO) issued several SIGMET of thunderstorms and severe turbulence affecting areas within LCCC FIR. The flight crew were not aware of the SIGMET issued by LCLK when the aircraft entered LCCC FIR.  With the aircraft at the top of descent (at FL360 within LCCC FIR), the commander, who was the pilot flying (PF), instructed the cabin crew to secure the cabin as he anticipated turbulence during descent and switched the seatbelt sign to ON. About three minutes into descent, at approximately 0804 UTC with the aircraft passing pressure altitude 29,200 ft, the aircraft started to encounter turbulence. The Copilot immediately made a passenger announcement for cabin crew to take their seats. Soon after, the aircraft encountered moderate to severe air turbulence. The flight crew believed the turbulence was âclear air turbulenceâ because there was no weather radar returns of precipitation displayed on the navigation display.  During the turbulence, the aircraft autopilot and autothrottle remained engaged and the aircraft remained inside its flight envelope. The turbulence-generated acceleration forces caused several unsecured cabin crewmembers and passengers to be forcefully lifted off their feet and impact cabin furnishings resulting in a serious injury to one passenger. There was no reported damage to the aircraft cabin.  The flight continued to the destination where the aircraft landed uneventfully. Causes The Air Accident Investigation Sector determines that the cause of the Accident was the significant vertical g-forces imposed on the Aircraft because of severe clear air turbulence, which caused an unsecured passenger to be forcefully lifted off her feet and impact cabin furnishings resulting in her right foot fracture serious injury. Contributory Factors (a) The influence of the jet stream and thunderstorm in the flight path area was significant enough to produce severe turbulence. (b) The flight crew decision making lacked critical information contained in SIGMET 3 issued by LCLK MWO (covering the period from 0530 to 0930) which forecasted severe turbulence between FL260 and FL390, south of latitude N3430. (c) The format of the SIGMET issued by LCLK MWO was different from the recommendations contained in ICAO Annex 3 and EU regulation No. 2020/469 such that the Weather Services International Fusion application (WSI Fusion) applied by the Operatorâs flight dispatch department did not generate a timely alert for SIGMET 3 report issued by LCLK MWO.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: GCAA Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: GCAA Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

The towing route followed the edge of the apron, which was damp and downhill, and involved a 90Â° left turn to line up for start. A combination of unfamiliarity with a relatively new operating base, towing in reverse and difficulty interpreting ""indistinct"" taxiway markings meant the tug driver entered the left turn later than intended. The late entry made the turn excessively tight, and the tug lost traction on the damp surface and jack-knifed. The resulting combination of a sharp towing angle and the aircraftÂs downhill momentum caused the towbar shear pin to break. The commander applied the brakes immediately on hearing ""the sound of snapping metal"" but was unable to prevent the aircraft rolling forward into the tug. The operatorÂs internal investigation report made several safety recommendations, including a review of towing procedures, enhanced driver training, the use of radios by towing teams and improvements to taxiway markings. The company also reviewed its apron risk assessment and towing was added to their audit plan. On 10 February 2021 the aircraft was ferried to Cranfield for repairs.

During the cruise the crew independently calculated the landing performance. Runway 26 at Exeter Airport (EXT) was forecast to be wet, so they planned to use Flap 40 for the landing, with Autobrake 3. With both pilots being familiar with EXT the co-pilot, who was Pilot Flying (PF), conducted a short brief of the pertinent points for the approach.  From the ATIS they noted that the weather seemed to be better than forecast and the surface wind was from 230Â° at 11 kt. The ATC provided the flight crew with radar vectors from ATC to the ILS on Runway 26 at EXT. The landing gear was lowered and Flap 25 selected before the aircraft intercepted the glideslope. Flap 40 (the landing flap) was selected on the glideslope just below 2000 ft amsl. With a calculated VREF of 134 kt and a surface wind of 10 kt the PF planned to fly the approach with a VAPP of 140 kt. At about 10 nm finals, upon looking at the flight management computer, the captain, who was Pilot Monitoring (PM), noticed there was a 30 kt headwind, so a VAPP of 144 kt was selected on the Mode Control Panel (MCP). The crew became visual with the runway at about 1000 ft aal. The PF then disconnected the Auto Pilot and Auto Throttle; the Flight Directors remained on. As the wind was now starting to decrease, the VAPP was then reduced from 142 to 140 kt at about 600 ft aal. As the wind reduced, towards the 10 kt surface wind, the PF made small adjustments to the power to maintain the IAS at or close to VAPP. At 500 ft radio altimeter (RA) the approach was declared stable by the crew, as per their standard operating procedures. At this point the aircraft had a pitch attitude of 2.5Â° nose down, the IAS was 143 kt, the rate of descent (ROD) was about 860 ft/min, the engines were operating at about 68% N1 and the aircraft was 0.4 dots above the glideslope. However, the ROD was increasing and soon thereafter was in excess of 1,150 ft/min. This was reduced to about 300 ft/min but soon increased again. At 320 ft RA, the aircraft went below the glideslope for about 8 seconds and, with a ROD of 1,700 ft/min, a 'SINK RATE' GPWS alert was enunciated. The PF acknowledged this and corrected the flightpath to bring the aircraft back to the glideslope before stabilizing slightly above the glideslope; the PM called this deviation too. As the PF was correcting back to the glideslope the PM did not feel there was a need to take control. During this period the maximum recorded deviation was 3/4 of a dot below the glideslope. At about 150 ft RA, with a ROD of 1,300 ft/min, there was a further 'SINK RATE' GPWS alert, to which the PM said, 'watch that sink rate ', followed by another 'Sink Rate' alert, which the PF responded by saying 'and back...' The commander recalled that as the aircraft crossed the threshold, at about 100 ft, the PF retarded the throttles, pitched the aircraft nose down, from about 5Â° nose up to 4Â° nose down, and then applied some power in the last few feet. During these final moments before the landing, there was another 'Sink Rate' alert. The result was a hard landing. A 'Pull Up' warning was also triggered by the GPWS, but it was not audible on the CVR. The last surface wind transmitted by ATC, just before the landing, was from 230Â° at 10 kt. During the rollout the commander took control, selected the thrust reversers and slowed down to taxi speed. After the aircraft had vacated the runway at Taxiway Bravo it became apparent the aircraft was listing to the left. During the After Landing checks the co-pilot tried to select Flaps Up, but they would not move. There was then a Hydraulic LP caution. As there was still brake accumulator pressure the crew were content to taxi the aircraft slowly the short distance onto Stand 10. Once on stand the listing became more obvious. It was then that the crew realised there was something 'seriously wrong' with the aircraft. After they had shut the aircraft down, the flight crew requested that the wheels were chocked, and the aircraft be connected to ground power before going outside to inspect the aircraft. Once outside a hydraulic leak was found. The fuselage skin aft of the wings was cracked and buckled, and the rear fuselage was distorted downward. The crown skin was creased and rippled along most of the fuselage. Both main landing gear shock absorbers were found to be bottomed, and the left main landing gear beam was distorted upwards such that the aircraft was approximately 2Â° left-wing low. he flap drive mechanism was damaged, and the left-wing inboard driveshaft was bent; the left inboard gearbox casing and its mountings were broken. The maximum vertical acceleration recorded by the FDR on touchdown was 3.8g, at this point there was 3Â° of left roll. Conclusion: The aircraft suffered a hard landing as a result of the approach being continued after it became unstable after the aircraft had past the point where the crew had declared the approach stable and continued. Despite high rates of descent being observed beyond the stable point, together with associated alerts the crew elected to continue to land. Had the approach been discontinued and a GA flown, even at a low height, while the aircraft may have touched down the damage sustained may have been lessened. While the OM did not specifically state that an approach was to remain stable beyond the gate on the approach, the FCTM was specific that, if it did not remain stable, a GA should be initiated. The commander may have given the co-pilot the benefit of doubt and believed she had the ability to correct an approach that became unstable in the final few hundred feet of the approach. However, had there been any doubt, a GA should be executed.METAR: 02:20 UTC / 02:20 local time: EGTE 190220Z 23010KT 9000 -RA SCT012 BKN040 12/10 Q1009=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: AAIB-27092 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: AAIB   Location  Images: photo (c) AAIB; Exeter Airport (EXT); January 2021 photo (c) AAIB; Exeter Airport (EXT); January 2021 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The runway was temporally closed for inspection, but found nothing abnormal.  There were no injuries among two crew members.   PROBABLE CAUSES The JTSB concludes that the probable cause of this accident was that when the Aircraft made a go-around while becoming unstable attitude after touching down and bouncing, the pitch angle became excessively large with an inadequate aircraft speed, which more likely resulted in the lower aft fuselage contacting with the runway. The Aircraft bounced after the touchdown is because it was likely insufficient to deal with the crosswind. The pitch angle became excessively large with an inadequate aircraft speed is probably because the PIC reflexively moved the reverse thrust levers after the touchdown, therefore, in the situation where it took time for the aircraft speed to increase due to the go-around operation, while being anxious about the runway-remaining length and others and trying to get off the ground as quickly as possible, the PIC performed the nose-up operation without checking the aircraft speed.METAR: UTC /  local time: RJAA 011030Z 18009KT 9999 FEW025 10/05 Q1017 WS R16R NOSIG RMK 1CU025 A3003= UTC /  local time: RJAA 011000Z 21009KT 9999 FEW025 10/06 Q1017 NOSIG RMK 1CU025  A3005= UTC /  local time: RJAA 010930Z 16006KT 140V200 9999 FEW020 SCT130 09/06 Q1018  NOSIG RMK 1CU020 3AC130 A3006=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JTSB Report number: AA2023-5 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: JTSB History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  28 March 2018 JA13KZ Nippon Cargo Airlines 0 between Los Angeles and San Francisco min Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates11-Feb-2025 15:39 ASN Updated [Source, Narrative, Accident report, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

According to the flight crew, just prior to top of descent the captain informed the flight attendants to prepare the cabin early because there was weather in the vicinity of the arrival airport. Shortly after that, the first officer (FO), who was the pilot flying, initiated the descent.  Air traffic control then cleared the flight to a lower altitude and requested they increase their descent. The FO complied, and increased their vertical speed, however, at some point, he engaged ""open descent"" mode. The FO saw the airspeed increasing towards red line and he pulled back on the stick and the autopilot disengaged. The captain said he then took control using the autopilot disconnect/priority switch and applied aft stick pressure to return the airplane to a normal descent pitch attitude to prevent an overspeed. According to the flight crew, the airplane was in clear air and smooth flight conditions when the event occurred. Two flight attendants (FA) in the aft galley, were thrown into the air and onto the floor.

It came down hard and the main gears and the nose gear broke. The plane slid on the runway and a fire broke out. The plane came to a stop to the left of the runway. Contributing factors: The three accidents discussed in the BEA final report have some similarities and highlight the difficulty for a crew to make an appropriate decision about using de-ice systems in icing conditions.  This decision is influenced by the high operational constraints due to the landing performance limitations in icing conditions on this type of plane. The extent of the landing performance penalties in icing conditions, compared to landing performance in non-icing conditions on this type of aircraft results in crews frequently encountering situations where the destination airport is accessible with comfortable safety margins in non -icing conditions but becomes inaccessible if the conditions are icing (i.e. total outside temperature below 5Â°C and visible moisture on approach, even in the absence of any signs of accretion on the aircraft). This may lead crews, both during flight planning and while carrying out the flight, to underestimate the risk of encountering icing conditions during the approach and landing in order to comply with the requested flight schedule or to avoid a diversion. Although compliance with the Flight Manual procedures is mandatory, the commercial pressures associated with this type of operation may encourage crews not to comply with the proper procedures for the approach and landing in icing conditions by deactivating the de-ice systems as soon as they visually observe that the leading edges of the wings are free of ice, and they consider that the risk of further contamination before landing is low. The statements gathered during the investigation suggest that this inadequate practice is common in the Phenom 100 pilot community. The following factors may have contributed to the crew not diverting and to them continuing the approach without the activation of the de-ice system: - The operator's choice to use an aeroplane type for flights to destinations where icing conditions on approach are not unlikely, although the performance of this aeroplane type is degraded in icing conditions and becomes incompatible with the runway landing distances available, even though these runway landing distances provide substantial margins in the absence of icing conditions. - The degraded landing performance of the Embraer EMB-500 Phenom 100 in icing conditions compared to performance in non-icing conditions. Crews thus frequently encounter situations where the destination airport is accessible with comfortable safety margins in non-icing conditions but becomes inaccessible in icing conditions. - A deviation in the application of the de-ice/anti-icing system activation procedure, due to the landing performance penalties in icing conditions on this aircraft type, which does not appear to be limited to this crew or this operator. Instead of activating the wing and horizontal stabilizer de-ice system as soon as the temperature drops below 5Â°C in the presence of visible moisture, this system is only activated by the crews when they visually observe ice on the leading edges of the wing. It is then deactivated as soon as these crews note the absence of ice on the leading edges of the wings and consider that the risk of further ice accumulation before landing is low.METAR: 09:30 UTC / 10:30 local time: LFPB 080930Z AUTO 36005KT 320V040 5000 BR OVC011 M01/M03 Q0998 BECMG BKN02010:00 UTC / 11:00 local time: LFPB 081000Z AUTO 01004KT 320V040 5000 BR OVC011 M01/M03 Q0998 BECMG BKN02010:30 UTC / 11:30 local time: LFPB 081030Z AUTO 34004KT 280V020 5000 BR OVC012 M01/M03 Q0998 BECMG BKN020Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Report number: BEA2021-0052 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: BEA   Location  Images: photo (c) BEA; Paris-Le Bourget Airport (LBG/LFPB) [F]; 08 February 2021; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) BEA; Paris-Le Bourget Airport (LBG/LFPB) [F]; 08 February 2021; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) James; Gloucestershire Airport (GLO/EGBJ); 17 March 2017; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane sustained substantial damage and the five occupants onboard were not injured. The flight crew later stated that at rotation speed, the captain applied back pressure to the control yoke; however, the nose did not rotate to a takeoff attitude. The captain attempted to rotate the airplane once more by relaxing the yoke then pulling it back again, and, with no change in the airplaneÂs attitude, he made the decision to reject the takeoff by retarding the thrust levers and applying maximum braking. The airplane overran the end of the runway onto a gravel pad where the landing gear collapsed.  The NTSB reported that the captain did not have a valid pilot certificate. A review of airmen records revealed that the FAA had issued an emergency revocation of all his certificates 2 years earlier on February 13, 2019. FAA records indicated that the reason for the emergency revocation was because he had falsified logbook entries and records for pilot proficiency checks, competency checks, and training events on 15 separate occasions while employed as a check pilot for a Part 135 operator. Probable Cause: The flight crewÂs operation of the airplane outside of the manufacturerÂs specified weight and balance limitations and with an improper trim setting, which resulted in the airplaneÂs inability to rotate during the attempted takeoff. Contributing to the accident, was the captainÂs lack of proper certification and the crewÂs lack of flight experience in the airplane make and model.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: WPR21LA110 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/corporate-jet-goes-off-runway-at-montgomery-airport-in-kearny-mesa/2521094/  https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/public-safety/story/2021-02-13/plane-crashes-during-takeoff-at-montgomery-field-airport   Location  Images: photo (c) daviator; San Diego-Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport, CA (MYF); 13 February 2021 photo (c) Cedric Ma; San Diego-Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport, CA (MYF); 13 February 2021 photo (c) Noel Philips; San Diego-Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport, CA (MYF); 13 February 2021 photo (c) Noel Philips; San Diego-Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport, CA (MYF); 13 February 2021 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft was attached to the French Transport Squadron 3/61 Poitou, stationed at OrlÃ©ans Bricy Air Base (BA123). It had been equipped with a large diameter and low pressure wheel kit (IFG) for the last ten days. On the day of the accident the flight crew was to practice short field landings at Blois/Le Breuil Airfield. On the fifth landing, the pilot in command was at the controls in the right seat. He wanted to land the aircraft near the threshold of the asphalt runway 12/30, with a right crosswind of 13 kt and gusts to 18 kt. Upon contact with the ground, the crew heard a squeal of tires. The aircraft veered to the right. The right wing lifted and the left wing touched the ground in a right yaw. The aircraft exited the runway to the right and came to rest on a grass runway, 30 meters from the edge of the paved runway. Causes of the event: The causes of the event fall within the environmental, organizational, and human factors domains. The crosswind on landing was at the limits of the aircraft's operating range. The piloting of the Twin Otter, in crosswind conditions at the limits of use, is delicate and requires precision and reactivity. The constrained planning of the flights led the crew to carry out a light preparation of this flight. The recent modification of the aircraft with the half-balloon wheel kit was not sufficiently consolidated for a complete appropriation by the crews. In the absence of a formal authorization of use, the pilots discover by themselves the particularities of this new configuration. The crews have not taken the measure of the new phenomena brought by the change concerning the centering, the attitude of the aircraft and the increased effectiveness of the braking system. The crew, by a bias of habit, kept their usual reference points and acted on the controls by going to the maximum travel of these without being able to counter the drift and the slide which was installed. The repetition of the exercises since the first flight of the day could have led to a decrease in the captain's attention, favouring the occurrence of a piloting error linked to cognitive biases of habit. The ignorance of the particular phenomenon of the scrambling, known of this type of aircraft led to an underestimation of the risk associated with a very front centering. The characteristics of the mission could have favored a wrong perception of the risk. The important aeronautical experience of the crew contributed to a feeling of control. A culture of performance strongly permeates the crews of the squadron. This generates a higher level of risk acceptability. The hypovigilance of the captain is a contributing factor to the occurrence of a habit bias in this event. Finally, the pilot in the left seat adopted a passive posture due to the captain's experience, delaying the resumption of control.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA-E Report number: A-2021-01-A Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The two pilots on board were not injured. The flight crew briefed and set up for the instrument landing system approach (ILS) to runway 18, expecting to break out of the overcast cloud layer and execute a visual approach to runway 36 due to more favorable winds. Upon exiting the overcast the captain activated the airportÂs pilot controlled lighting system and the first officer saw the runway. Both pilots believed the runway that they saw was runway 36. They maneuvered the airplane visually toward the runway that was in-sight and executed a landing. Upon touchdown it became clear that they had inadvertently landed on runway 32, which they new was closed.  The airplane struck a snow berm at the edge of the intersection with runway 36, the landing gear broke from the airplane and the airplane slid to a stop. The airplane sustained damage to the landing gear, lower fuselage, wings and ventral strakes. The runway had been closed due to the large amount of snow. The runway was covered with about 4 inches of snow that had yet to be cleared. The airport manager noted that the runway lights were on due to the snowplow operations that were taking place as an aid in determining the location of the runway edge. There were no plow trucks on runway 32 at the time of the accident because they had stopped for a dinner break. Probable Cause: The flight crewÂs failure to verify the correct runway for landing, which resulted in a landing on a snow contaminated runway and resulting damage to the airplane. The illumination of the lights associated with the closed runway contributed to the accident.METAR: 00:15 UTC / 19:15 local time: KJVY 190015Z AUTO 36005KT 10SM OVC025 M01/M05 A3026 RMK AO2 T10151050 TSNO23:35 UTC / 18:35 local time: KJVY 182335Z AUTO 00000KT 10SM SCT025 BKN043 M01/M05 A3026 RMK AO2 T10141051 TSNO23:55 UTC / 18:55 local time: KJVY 182355Z AUTO 03003KT 10SM BKN025 OVC043 M01/M05 A3026 RMK AO2 T10151051 11005 21023 TSNOAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN21LA136 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: flightaware.com  NTSB   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All three on board were unhurt. During the final approach to runway 17 at Monfort, the right landing gear hit the ground hard, causing the aircraft to substantially change its trajectory and skid on the left side. The two engines impacted the ground and the propellers became detached. The aircraft finally came to rest on the runway with substantial damage. The three occupants were unharmed and left the aircraft under their own power. Probable Cause(s): Abnormal contact of the aircraft before the runway, as a result of an approach made at too low a landing angle, in an attempt by the crew to make a short landing. Contributing Factors The investigation process determined that the accident was caused by a combination of the following factors: - Loss of situational awareness of the crew, who neglected the position of the aircraft in relation to the terrain during the approach, when attempting to make a short landing, probably caused by overconfidence and by the Pilot in Command's maladjustment to flying, who was making his first flights after a 70-day inactivity, caused by health problems. - Deficient condition of the safety zone and runway thresholds, without demarcation and with unevenness, which contributed to the initial damage to the aircraft, fracture of the right landing gear and which triggered other damages to the aircraft. - Deficient airfield conditions, as it lacked the minimum signage, such as demarcation of the beginning, end and margins of the usable runway, airfield limits and wind indication; these limitations increased the crew's workload as they lacked basic guidance to perform the landing in a limited field. - Lack of supervision by the operator, who did not have a flight readjustment procedure for crews after a significant inactivity, and, instead, scheduled the Pilot to perform a demanding operation to a runway with limited conditions on the first day of his return to flight. - Lack of risk management on the part of the operator, who despite knowing the risk conditions of the Monfort runway, did not have the necessary defenses for an acceptably safe operation on it, nor did it take the necessary steps to improve its conditions with the aerodrome operator, the government of the department of VaupÃ©s. - Absence of surveillance of crews under stressful conditions, high workloads, taking into account that the company operates on restricted runways with a high probability of accidents, conditions that increase the risk considerably during the operation. - Absence of minimum signage on the runway, increasing the workload for the crew, considering that they never had a reference point to perform calculations or correct estimates during approach and landing.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Aerocivil Report number: COL-21-08-GIA Status: Investigation completedDuration: 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Aerocivil History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  24 January 2008 HK-2006 VIARCO 0 Teresita Airport sub 26 August 2020 HK-2006 ALIANSA Colombia 0 Jorge Enrique GonzÃ¡lez Torres Airport (SJE/SKSJ),San Jose del Guaviare min Location  Images: photo (c) Jaime Escobar; Barranquilla-Ernesto Cortissoz International Airport (BAQ/SKBQ); 12 December 2012 photo (c) Jaime Escobar; Barranquilla-Ernesto Cortissoz International Airport (BAQ/SKBQ); 12 December 2012 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates14-Feb-2025 10:24 ASN Updated The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Findings: The investigation concluded that the cause of the accident was that the aircraft was flying in icy conditions for a long period of time during an artificial rainfall operation and the wings and propellers became seriously iced up. The aircraft was unable to effectively control the risk of icing, which resulted in the aircraft losing speed and entering a spin, eventually crashing to the ground and catching fire. Based on the casualties and damage to the aircraft, the incident constituted a major general aviation accident of aircraft crew origin. The investigation also found that the aircraft had been modified in such a way that the relevant data was not available and that the crew did not handle the spin properly.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CAAC Report number: 20210301TFSQ01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: weibo.cn  finance.sina.com.cn   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The filed flight plan indicated that the flight would be conducted under the Visual Flight Rule (VFR). At 09:08 LT, in daylight conditions, the aircraft departed from Wamena. The pilot was the only person on board the aircraft and this flight was the second flight of the day for the pilot and the aircraft. Prior to the departure, there was no record or report of aircraft system malfunction. Considering that the aircraft altitude was higher than normal for the landing approach to runway 09 at Angguruk and attempting to avoid clouds, the pilot made several maneuvers over Angguruk. During that maneuver, the pilot noticed that the grass on the runway, about 50 meters from beginning of the runway 09 and the grass about 30 meters before the threshold of runway 09 had brighter color than the other grass. The pilot thought that the brighter color-grass was the grass that had been cut. When on final approach, the pilot noticed that the runway threshold markers were visible. The pilot recalled that the markers did not stand out as usual due to the color. The pilot also recalled that the area about 30 meters before the threshold runway 09 looked usable for landing, as the color was no different with the 50 meters of the beginning runway. The pilot planned to make touchdown in the very beginning of runway 09 as he did not want to use more braking to decelerate the aircraft. The aircraft touched down about 22 meters before the runway threshold, then veered to the left and stopped about 112 meters from the beginning runway 09 on heading 182Â°.

He corrected for the slide back towards the runway center line, but the airplane encountered a ""violent gust of wind"" and began to slide again. He applied right brake and right rudder while leaving in full right aileron, but the airplane had zero braking action. As the airplane continued to slide, he applied engine power in an attempt to increase the rudder authority and ""correct the direction back towards the runway"" to no avail. Subsequently, the airplane slid off the left side of the runway, the left wheel impacted a snowbank, and the airplane tipped to the left. The airplane came to rest in a nose down attitude, banked to the left at about a 40Â° angle, and sustained substantial damage to the left wing and aileron.

Of the 262 passengers and crew onboard, one flight attendant sustained serious injuries. The airplane was not damaged. The regularly scheduled international passenger flight was operating under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 from Cancun International Airport (MMUN), Cancun, Mexico to KDFW. According to the flight crew, the captain made a public address announcement to the flight attendants to prepare for landing between FL200 and FL190. When passing 8,500 ft on vectors for a visual approach to KDFW, the crew heard another aircraft in the area report turbulence on the ATC frequency. Subsequently, the captain called the number 1 flight attendant (FA) to notify him of the potential turbulence and ensure the flight attendants took their jumpseats. Approaching the GACHO intersection at 6,500 feet, the crew stated the aircraft experienced a moderate 'jolt' of turbulence lasting about one second. The flight crew stated that the weather was unrestricted visibility and no precipitation in the vicinity of the turbulence encounter.   At the time of the turbulence, the FAs had completed securing the cabin. One FA in the aft galley was thrown into the air and then onto the floor against the right side of the aft galley when attempting to reach her jumpseat. She injured her right hip and had to remain on the galley floor for landing. Paramedics met the flight at the gate and transported the injured FA to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a broken hip.

Of the 66 passengers and crew onboard, one flight attendant sustained serious injuries. The airplane was not damaged. The regularly scheduled domestic passenger flight was operating under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 from Salt Lake City International Airport (KSLC), Salt Lake City, Utah to KLAX. According to witnesses, upon arrival at the gate in KLAX, the flight attendant (FA) fell from the top of the main cabin doorsteps to the ramp surface below after opening the main cabin door (MCD). She was then observed standing up, climbing back up the stairs and then falling to the ramp a second time. Ramp employees immediately came to her aid and alerted the captain of the flight who subsequently called company operations and requested emergency medical personnel be sent. She was transported to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a broken left wrist, right clavicle, and ribs.  Ramp video at KSLC showed the MCD was closed without pinning the handrails when the normal procedure was for the FA to call ground handling personnel to pin the railings before closing the door. The accident flight was the FAs first flight out of Initial Operating Experience, which was performed during a flight on an ERJ-175. Normal operating procedures for the CRJ-700 MCD requires the handrails to be up and pinned prior to closing the door, however, the FA did not indicate knowledge of that procedure requirement when interviewed following the accident. The FA also indicated during the interview that prior to landing, she hit her head on an open galley compartment door and felt disoriented, dizzy, and nauseated. Subsequent to the accident, the operator issued two safety bulletins to their employees describing the lessons learned from this accident and reviewing the opening procedures for the CRJ MCD. The operator also added CRJ door operation as a top safety focus area and required a demonstration of the CRJ MCD operation to the curriculum for those FAs being instructed on ERJ-175's.    Probable Cause: the improper retraction of the main cabin door, which resulted in the flight attendant falling when she opened the door at the destination.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA21LA096 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA21LA096  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates04-Jun-2022 06:53 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

After completing the photogrammetric flight and landing at Gdansk-Lech Walesa Airport (EPGD), the airplane was parked on apron 1, stand No 1. Due to the planned return flight, the pilot submitted the flight plan and then he was waiting for a decision of his operations office. In the meantime he inspected the airplane, checked the fuel and oil quantity, and, among other things, the presence of chocks under the nose landing gear. Then he stayed in the cockpit and after about 40 minutes the pilot received the decision to return to EPRZ alone. The pilot performed the preflight procedure, started the engines, checked their operating parameters and asked the TWR for clearance to taxi to runway in use. Having received the clearance, the pilot increased the engines speed, but the airplane did not move. The pilot realized that he had not removed the chocks and left the cockpit with the engines running to remove the chocks. The pilot did not remember whether he had pulled the parking brake lever before leaving the cockpit. Having left the cockpit, the pilot moved to the area of the nose landing gear and removed the chocks, and at that point the airplane began to move. The pilot tried to stop the airplane, but tripped over the previously removed chocks and fell down. The airplane taxied over the pilot and moved towards the taxiway L. The pilot tried to catch up with the moving airplane, but failed to do so. The P68 airplane crossed taxiway L and hit the rear part of a Saab 340A, SP-KPU, parked at stand number 32.

Of the 50 passengers and crew onboard, one passenger sustained serious injuries and the first officer, flight attendant, and one passenger sustained minor injuries. The airplane was not damaged. The regularly scheduled domestic passenger flight was operating under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 from Tri-cities Airport (KTRI), Blountville, TN.  The flight crew stated they expected turbulence on arrival into KCLT, because they had flown in from KCLT on the flight prior to the accident flight. As a result, prior to pushback of the accident flight, the captain made a public address announcement that the fasten seatbelt sign would remain on and the passengers and flight attendants (FA) should remain seated for the entirety of the flight. As the flight was being vectored around severe convective activity on arrival into KCLT and approaching 12,000 feet, they encountered severe turbulence with downdrafts. The autopilot disconnected and the airplane descended below its assigned level off altitude. The first officer, who was the pilot flying, took manual control of the airplane and began climbing back to 12,000 feet. After exiting the turbulent conditions, the captain called the FA and was informed that one passenger had been injured.  According to the FA, a passenger got up while the seatbelt sign was on and was in the lavatory when the turbulence was encountered. The passenger complained of back pain as she returned back to her seat after the event. Two medically qualified passengers assisted the injured passenger inflight. After landing, paramedics transported the injured passenger to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a fractured vertebrae.   At the time of the flight's arrival into KCLT, a SIGMET was active for imbedded thunderstorms and turbulence.

The aircraft was pushed back from Stand 2 onto taxiway I and the tow proceeded along taxiway I and taxiway J, crossing runway 23. As the tow truck turned onto taxiway K, the tow bar became detached and the aircraft proceeded straight, entering the cargo and GSE Area and coming to rest against a bank of 4 fuel bowsers parked side by side. Conclusions: Aircraft towing is a routine operation that, despite its relatively mundane nature, requires careful operation and stringent safety procedures to ensure that incidents and accidents are avoided. This accident occurred due to a lack of adherence to such procedures, including: 1) Proper flight deck checks and aircraft setup for a towing procedure; 2) Adequate coordination between ground staff and the tug driver to ensure a safe environment that avoids the need of sudden braking by the tug; 3) Careful checking of the shear pins following a sudden or sharp braking event; 4) Correct seating of the brake operator in the pilotÂs seat during tow to be able to apply brakes in an effective and timely manner in the event of tow bar detachment. In addition, the lack of training on aircraft operating procedures and emergency evacuation procedures given to the tow crew jeopardized the safe securing of the aircraft and safe evacuation after the accident. In conclusion, the cause of the accident was identified to be: - A lack of training, clear procedures and inadequate level of attention given to safety during operation.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BAAI Report number: BAAI/ACR-002-2021 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: timesofmalta.com  https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/9h-qcj   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot and 4 passengers were not injured.  The pilot reported that, he had brushed off the snow on the airplane before refueling the airplane. The passengers then boarded the airplane, and he readied the airplane for departure. During the takeoff roll, the engine gauges were in the green and everything seemed normal. During climb out, he began to retract the flaps, and while raising the last 10Â°, the engine began to run rough. The pilot elected to abort the landing, and reduced engine power and lowered the nose toward the runway. The airplane subsequently landed hard, bounced, and came to a stop off the runway. The left main landing gear was damaged along with the left side fuselage, which sustained substantial damage.  The passengers stated that after the airplane lifted off the runway, the engine sputtered, and then the airplane touched back down on the runway. It bounced 3 or 4 times before it came to a stop. Postaccident examination of the engine, which included an engine run by the operator, revealed no evidence of any preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. A fuel sample was tested, with no discrepancies noted. Ground witnesses reported heavy snowfall and a buildup of snow on the airplane. Witnesses further reported that there were no wing covers on the wings. They also reported that the pilot had brushed off an accumulation of snow before departing.

According to the first officer, who was initially the flying pilot, they departed from Centennial Airport (APA) for a short positioning flight to Colorado Springs (COS). After departure, air traffic control provided vectors to intercept the GPS approach for 17R at COS. The crew intercepted the approach at the initial approach fix and descended as required to meet the mandatory crossing altitudes. The airplane exited the overcast cloud layer at an altitude of 650- 700 ft above ground level and the first officer had COS in sight. It was at this time that the first officer reported he realized that visually, the flight path was offset about 0,5 mile right of the runway centerline.   The captain requested control of the airplane and then made the required course correction to line up with the centerline of the runway. This correction occurred about 1,5 - 2 miles from the runway threshold. About 100 ft above the ground, the captain reduced the throttles to ""idle"", was able to establish runway centerline, and continued the descent for landing.  As the airplane descended through 10-20 ft above the runway, the captain reported that the ""stick shaker"" activated. The first officer was monitoring and announced ""stall,"" and the captain advanced both throttles. Just before the airplane touched down, it experienced an uncommanded roll to the right and the nose dropped. The captain attempted to arrest the roll by applying left aileron, but the airplane did not respond in time and the right tip tanking struck the runway surface just before the landing gear contacted the runway. The crew was able to maintain control throughout the rollout and the airplane continued to taxi and exit the runway under its own power. The airplane received substantial damage to the right wing. Probable Cause: The flight crewÂs improper decision to continue the unstabilized approach, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall and impact with the runway during landing.METAR: 15:54 UTC /  local time: SPECI KCOS 151641Z 14019KT 6SM BR OVC005 02/01 A2995 RMK AO2 DZE40 METAR KCOS 151554Z 23004KT 3SM -DZ BR OVC003 01/M01 A2998Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN21LA190 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot reported to the NTSB that, during final approach to land, he noticed a road grader operating on the far end of the runway. He made a radio transmission stating that the flight was 4 miles out on final approach and observed the road grader pull over at the opposite end of the airport and park. Believing that the operator of the road grader heard his call and parked, he proceeded with a normal approach and landing. After touchdown, he applied reverse with moderate braking. When the airplane was fully out of reverse and had slowed to about 35 mph, he noticed a large piece of foreign object debris (FOD) on the runway centerline. The FOD appeared to be about 18 inches wide and about 12 inches tall. He veered to the left in an effort to straddle the FOD with main landing gear. Subsequently, the right main landing gear struck the FOD, the right main landing gear collapsed, and the airplane slid about 75 ft down the runway centerline before coming to a stop. A postaccident inspection revealed that the FOD was a chunk of ice. Probable Cause: The pilotÂs failure to visually inspect the runway condition before landing, which resulted in a collision with an ice chunk and main landing gear separation during landing.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ANC21LA030 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: adn.com  sfchronicle.com   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot, copilot, and passengers described that the pilot descended to a lower altitude and flew along a riverbed, at times at an altitude that was below the surrounding trees and terrain. The pilot stated that he next planned on doing a touch-and-go landing on the river to entertain the passengers. One of the passengers said that while flying along the river, the pilots were concerned about hitting powerlines and had to maneuver to prevent hitting them and a bridge. Shortly after, as the pilots were following a sharp bend in the river while looking for a place to conduct a touch-and-go landing, the airplane's right wing stuck a power line. The airplane's right wing and aileron were substantially damaged, though the damage did not prohibit the airplane from being able to fly, and the pilot characterized that the airplane felt out of trim and 'a little heavier on one side.'Â The flight continued towards their destination and a subsequent conversation ensued between the pilot and the passengers, asking if the meeting could be missed, and if they should return to their departure airport, about 45 minutes away. The decision was made to return to the departure airport where the airplane landed without further incident. The pilot elected not to perform a precautionary landing at a nearby airport nor declare an emergency because the airplane appeared to be performing well.  The operator stated there were no mechanical deficiencies with the airplane that contributed to the accident. Further, the operator did not have any guidance or policies relating to low-altitude maneuvering with passengers onboard. Probable Cause: The pilot's improper decision to conduct a low altitude flight and his failure to see and avoid powerlines. Contributing was the operator's lack of safety guidance or a safety policy for low-altitude operations.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA21LA193 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  4 September 2024 N143CA Haugland Group Aviation LLC 0 East River, NY sub Wingtip, pod strike Location  Images: photo (c) FAA; 26 April 2021 photo (c) FAA; 26 April 2021 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates09-Sep-2024 16:18 ASN Updated [Source, Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All three occupants were injured. Approaching the joint military and civilian airport at Gwalior the crew were advised by ATC that runway 24L was in use. ATC then asked the crew if they would like to carry out a VOR approach for the opposite runway 06R. The crew requested for a night visual approach for runway 06R and were cleared to descend 2700 ft. After reporting that they had the airport in sight, the crew were cleared to circuit altitude. The first officer called turning right base with field visual and the flight was cleared to land which the crew acknowledged. Just before landing the aircraft and short of the threshold, the main gear collided with the raised arrester barrier and came to a halt on the runway 06R just beyond the threshold markings. Since Gwalior is a joint military/civil airport, the barrier nets were used to prevent military jets from overrunning runway 24L and were inadvertently left in a raised position. Probable cause of the Accident: 1) The PIC (PF) carrying out a visual approach at night and knowingly deviated below the visual approach path profile (3 degrees) while disregarding the PAPI indications, thereby the aircraft collided with the raised Arrester Barrier. 2) Lack of Assertiveness on the part of the Co-pilot (PM). Contributory Factors: 1) Non-Compliance to the SOP of ""Change of Runway Checklist"" by the ATC staff leading to the ""Arrester Barrier"" remaining in a ""Raised Position"" while the aircraft (VT-MPQ) came in for landing on runway 06R. 2) Non-essential conversation by the flight crew during the final approach for landing causing distraction leading to a delayed sighting of the raised Arrester Barrier. 3) Systemic failure at various levels at the Gwalior Air Force Base to ensure that the ""Arrester Barrier Position Indicator Lights and Integral Panel Lights"" were not rectified in a stipulated time period. 4) A robust alternate procedure was not defined when the ""Arrester Barrier Position Indicator Lights and Integral Panel Lights"" were unserviceable. 5) The Gwalior Airforce Base authorities did not install ""Red Obstacle Lights"" on the Arrester Barrier Poles to indicate the position of the obstacle on the date of the accident as per the DGCA requirements (CAR Section 4, Series B, Part 1).Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB India Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: timesofindia.indiatimes.com  ndtv.com   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The copilot was Pilot Flying. The flight was cleared for an RNP approach to runway 21. At 10:05 the aircraft was at 958 feet and passed the minimum descent height. The flight reported runway in sight and continued the approach.  At a distance of 1.5 nm from the runway threshold, the aircraft dropped below the glide slope.  At 10:06:14, at about 0.15 nm from the runway, the pilot called ""come and go around"", and two seconds later, the autopilot was disconnected. Four seconds later the main landing gear and tail skid struck the top of a concrete perimeter wall The flight crew continued the missed approach procedure and radioed that they suspected damage to the nose landing gear. At 10:08, the flight crew requested to return to Songshan Airport. Suspecting damage to the nose gear, the flight crew first flew a low pass over runway 10  at 10:45 hours. The tower controller at Songshan Airport reported observing damage to the right main gear wheels. The pilot decided to fly the traffic circuit with the gear down and landed on runway 10 at 11:07 hours. The aircraft and the runway surface were damaged but there were no injuries. Findings Related to Probable Cause: When the occurrence aircraft performed a non-precision approach to runway 21 of Nangan Airport, the pre-threshold area was obscured by low clouds or marine fog. During the final approach, the pilot flying used the autopilot lateral navigation and vertical speed mode for the approach. Focusing on flight operations in the cockpit, the pilot flying lost situational awareness of the aircraft position and did not realize that the aircraft altitude was very close to the runway threshold elevation. When the aircraft entered low clouds and was unable to maintain visual contact with the runway, the pilot flying did not follow the procedure of immediate execution of a go-around but continued using the autopilot for the approach, the pilot monitoring did not remind the pilot flying to execute or call for a go-around. When the pilot flying decided to perform a go-around, the aircraft had reached an altitude of 229 ft, 11 ft above the runway threshold elevation. Because the altitude was too low, before the aircraft could establish an effective positive rate of climb, the aircraftÂs main wheels and tail skid collided with the top outer edge of the pre-threshold area of runway 21, causing substantial damage to the aircraft.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TTSB Report number: TTSB-FRP-21-09-001 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: TTSB   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

At approximately 23:30 h, the passengers began to disembark via the aircraftâs forward stairs. While disembarking, one of the passengers got one of the two suitcases he was carrying caught on the stairs and lost his balance. Being unable to grab the handrail, he fell from the top of the stairs and hit another passenger at the bottom of the stairs. The passenger who fell sustained serious injuries. The crew stopped the disembarkation via the forward stairs and redirected the rest of the passengers towards the rear exit of the aircraft. The ground personnel immediately assisted the injured passenger, and the dispatcher called for an ambulance, which took approximately 10 minutes to arrive and transferred the wounded passenger to hospital. At the hospital, the injured passenger received stitches to his head, and it was confirmed that he had broken his arm. The investigation has determined that the cause of the accident was the passengerâs decision to disregard the disembarkation instructions and descend the stairs with one suitcase in each hand. The stairs are approximately 0.62 m2 wide, which is sufficient for passengers to carry a single suitcase. However, as was shown in this case, it may not be enough to carry two suitcases, especially if they are separated a certain distance from the body. Moreover, anyone carrying two suitcases would be unable to grasp the handrail should they lose their balance.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIAIAC Report number: A-020/2021 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: CIAIAC Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

The Cirrus departed Denver-Centennial Airport (APA) for a local flight about 09:21, and the Metro II departed the Salida Airport (SLT) about 09:56. The Cirrus was performing a right-hand traffic pattern for runway 17R at APA, and N280KL was on final approach for runway 17L at APA, when the collision occurred. Both airplanes were in communication with air traffic control during their respective approaches to the airport. About 10:22:43, the Metro II was about 5.5 nm from APA and had completed a right turn to align with the final approach course to runway 17L. At this same time, the Cirrus was on the downwind leg of the right-hand traffic pattern for runway 17R just before he commenced a right turn to the base leg of the traffic pattern. The Metro continued its approach and remained aligned with runway 17L. The Cirrus continued the right-hand traffic pattern through the base leg, and then began to turn toward the final approach course for the runway. The airplanes collided at 10:23:53 when they were about 3.2 nm from APA. The Metro was aligned with runway 17L while the Cirrus was turning from base to final and heading about 146Â° when the collision occurred. After the impact, N280KL declared an emergency, continued to APA, and landed successfully on runway 17L without further incident. The Cirrus pilot reported that the airplane was not controllable after the impact and he deployed the Cirrus Airframe Parachute System (CAPS). The aircraft came to rest about 3 nm north of APA. Probable Cause and Findings: The Cirrus pilotÂs failure to maintain the final approach course for the assigned runway, which resulted in a collision with the Swearingen which was on final approach to the parallel runway. Contributing to the accident was the failure of the controller to issue a traffic advisory to the Swearingen pilot regarding the location of Cirrus, and the Cirrus pilotÂs decision to fly higher than recommended approach speed which resulted in a larger turn radius and contributed to his overshoot of the final approach course.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN21FA215A Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  9 March 1982 N323BA Britt Airways 0 South Bend, IN min 11 December 1986 N323BA Britt Airways 0 Paducah, KY min Location  Images: photo (c) L1011TRISTAR; Denver-Centennial Airport, CO (APA/KAPA); 12 May 2021 photo (c) NTSB; Denver-Centennial Airport, CO (APA/KAPA); 12 May 2021 photo (c) NTSB; Denver-Centennial Airport, CO (APA/KAPA); 12 May 2021 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

According to the flight crew, this was the captainÂs first flight of the month after being on vacation, and it was the first officerÂs (FO) first day back flying since September 2020 due to furlough. The flight crew indicated that prior to pushback, they had setup the airplane for a south departure from DFW. However, after being pushed back, they completed the After Start Checklist and then noticed that the other traffic was departing to the north. After confirming this by tuning in the Automated Terminal Information System (ATIS), they updated their departure clearance before calling the ramp for taxi clearance. The captain stated that the airplane must have veered left of centerline as he and the FOÂs attention was focused inside the cockpit as they were reconfiguring the instruments. The captain indicated that the left wing struck a light pole, as he was adjusting the course and heading knobs. The captain stopped the airplane, called ground control, and the airplane was subsequently towed back to the gate. Post-flight inspection revealed substantial damage to the left wing, including damage to the number 1 leading edge slat, wing skin, front spar, and track ribs.

The pilot stated that, on final approach, he lowered the landing gear, placed the propeller controls forward, confirmed that the landing gear position indicator lights illuminated green, and completed the before landing checklist. He stated that he felt the drag associated with the gear being extended, but the airplane was not slowing as much as usual. As the airplane crossed the runway threshold, the pilot heard radio transmissions from the controller and another airplane to check the landing gear configuration, and he stated that he saw three green lights. He reported that the landing was smooth and felt normal; however, the airplane settled onto the runway and within a few seconds, the propellers impacted the ground. Airport surveillance video indicated that the airplane's landing gear remained fully retracted during the approach and over the runway just before touchdown. Postaccident examination of the landing gear and landing gear indicating/warning system revealed no anomalies that would have precludedÂ normal operation. The circumstances of the accident are consistent with the pilot's failure to properly configure the landing gear before landing.

After the airplane touched down on the runway, he applied the brakes, however, there was no braking action from the airplane and the pilot reported that there was no compression of the brake pedals. The pilot called out that they had ""no brakes"" and elected to pull the emergency brake.

The airplane struck the grass apron next to the runway, completed a 180Â° turn, and came to rest the opposite direction of travel in the grass to the left side of the runway. Examination of the wreckage by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed that the right main landing gear collapsed, which resulted in substantial damage to the right wing. Furthermore, the left main landing gear tire was located about 225 ft from the main wreckage. Examination of the airplane discrepancy log revealed that the left main landing gear tire was replaced the morning of the accident due to a discrepancy the pilot wrote up the day before the accident, which stated the left main landing gear tire was Âworn beyond [the] thread cords.Â  The same aircraft was involved in an incident back in 2018 at DeKalb-Peachtree Airport (KPDK).

Two passengers onboard received serious injuries and 2 passengers received minor injuries. The aircraft took off from Mumbai and the flight was uneventful throughout climb and cruise phase. Kolkata ATIS issued weather warning of TSRA and gusty winds at the time of arrival of the aircraft at Kolkata. The PF made a PA informing passenger about the expected turbulent weather during descent and advised to keep the seat belt fastened. PF also informed the SCC to secure the cabin. The aircraft was on the right of the assigned track as there were CBâs & Line squalls along the route and also to the left hand side of the route. Further to this deviation, there were similar line squalls and thunderstorms. As per the flight crew, during descent at FL390, they identified a 20 NM gap between two CBâs and decided to fly through it. While passing through the gap aircraft started experiencing light to moderate turbulence. This moderate turbulence lasted for 10-15 seconds and ended with a huge bump of severe turbulence, which lasted for 1-2 seconds.  Probable Cause of the Accident The accident occurred as the aircraft entered into a severe turbulence instead of circumnavigating it. This resulted in serious injuries to passengers who presumably did not comply withâ fasten seat beltâ sign and instructions given by cabin crew. Contributory factors to the accident were: - â¢ The flight crew was well aware about the deteriorating weather at and around Kolkata. Notwithstanding this, they continued the flight in severe weather conditions. â¢ Operatorâs Operations Manual does not provide clear cut guidance to flight crew regarding circumnavigation through the enroute bad weather (weather avoidance). â¢ At any point during the flight, the flight crew did not consider diverting to an alternate airfield even though they were not sure whether the gap is clear of any clouds. â¢ Flight Dispatch did not provide any guidance to flight crew, while they were negotiating enroute weather which was not in line with the company Flight Dispatch Manual. â¢ As the aircraft was approaching the identified gap, PIC instructed cabin crew to be seated due to which the process of seatbelt compliance and securing the cabin could not be completed.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB India Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: https://indianexpress.com/article/india/vistara-mumbai-kolkata-flight-passengers-7348273/  https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/vt-tge#27f72d6e  Video : http://www.goklerdeyiz.net/yolcu-ucagi-turbulansa-yakalandi-8-yolcu-yaralandi/  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates07-Jun-2021 19:57 Goklerdeyiz.net Added 07-Jun-2021 19:59 harro Updated [Time, Aircraft type, Total fatalities, Total occupants, Other fatalities, Location, Source, Narrative, ]07-Apr-2022 09:21 harro Updated [Total occupants, Damage, Narrative, Accident report, ]16-Jun-2024 16:53 ASN Updated [Narrative, ]17-Jun-2024 15:48 ASN Updated [Category, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The captain of the flight was Pilot Flying, the copilot was Pilot Monitoring. During approach to Hubli, the aircraft was cleared to land on runway 26. The aircraft touched down on the runway and bounced four times. All four touchdowns were hard, the first was a three point landing and on the subsequent three landings, the nose landing gear touched the runway first. After the fourth touchdown the crew initiated a go-around. During the go-around, the landing gear unsafe warning was displayed 20 seconds. However, this went unnoticed by the crew. Subsequently, when the landing gears were selected up, the landing gear unsafe indication cleared automatically. Thereafter, the aircraft climbed as per instructions of ATC Hubli and entered a holding pattern. During the second approach to the same runway 26, when the landing gears were selected down, the landing gear unsafe warning was displayed again, which was noticed by the crew. As there were three green indications on the primary display and one red indication for the nose landing gear on on the overhead panel, the crew disregarded the unsafe indication as per QRH procedure.

Probable Cause: The probable cause of this accident is attributed to inappropriate aircraft landing technique and not following the bounced landing recovery procedure i.e., delayed flare, high speed at touchdown and delay in initiating a ""Go-Around"". Contributory factors for this accident were lack of situational awareness and lack of commitment to initiate a ""Go-Around"" after experiencing a significant bounce.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB India Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft was on stand being prepared for a cargo flight to Frankfurt (BA906). A ground maintenance team was working to address three fault messages associated with the Nose Landing Gear (NLG) doors while the flight crew prepared the aircraft for the flight. The Dispatch Deviation Guide confirmed that rectification of the defects could be deferred to a later date providing the landing gear was recycled to confirm the NLG doors functioned correctly. To prevent the landing gear from retracting when up was selected, the landing gear downlock pins were fitted. However, when the lead engineer selected the landing gear lever to up, the NLG retracted. The aircraftÂs nose struck the ground causing significant damage to the lower front section of the aircraft and inflicting minor injuries on the co-pilot and one of the cargo loading team. The NLG downlock pin had inadvertently been inserted in the downlock link assembly apex pin bore instead of the downlock pin hole. The design of the aircraft nose landing gear downlock assembly created an opportunity for error when inserting the NLG locking pin, with two holes located so close together that the pin could be inadvertently inserted in the incorrect location. A Service Bulletin and Airworthiness Directive was available that would have prevented the accident, but this had not yet been completed on G-ZBJB. AAIB Conclusions: The aircraft NLG retracted on the ground when the landing gear selection lever was selected to up as part of a maintenance procedure. The NLG downlock pin had inadvertently been inserted in the downlock link assembly apex pin bore instead of the downlock pin hole.  When the nose of the aircraft struck the ground, significant damage was caused to the lower front section of the aircraft and minor injuries to the co-pilot and a member of the cargo load team. The design of the aircraft nose landing gear downlock assembly created an opportunity for error when inserting the NLG locking pin, with two holes located so close together that the pin could be inadvertently inserted in the incorrect location. There were powerful auditory and tactile cues that could easily mislead someone to believe the pin was correctly inserted even when it wasnÂt and there were no strong visual indications to distinguish between the correct and incorrect placements. The determination of the risk of incorrect installation of the NLG downlock pin in the manufacturerÂs SB and the regulatorÂs AD did take account of the design of the B787 NLG and the associated probability for error. The operatorÂs process to embody ADs and SBs considered flight safety, airworthiness and the ADÂs ÂeffectÂ in enhancing safety, but there was no documented evidence that health and safety risks had been fully considered. Had these risks, that were clearly highlighted in the AD and SB, been given greater significance by the operator during the embodiment process, the priority of the modification may have been escalated and avoided the decision to defer implementation to the end of the compliance period.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: AAIB-27411 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: AAIB   Location  Images: photo (c) AAIB; London Heathrow Airport (LHR); 18 June 2021 photo (c) AAIB; London Heathrow Airport (LHR); 18 June 2021 photo (c) AAIB; London Heathrow Airport (LHR) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The right-hand main gear collapsed. The pilot was planning to conduct an aerial application flight on a rice field. It appeared that the pilots licence of the captain had expired in 2010. The accident with the An-2 RA-01430 aircraft occurred during takeoff from a landing strip with a non-uniform surface, which led to the aircraft yawing during the takeoff run. Correcting the directional sway, the PIC allowed a sharp operation of the brakes and wheels, which, in turn, led to an uncontrolled turn to the left, as a result of which the aircraft rolled out of the landing area and collided with a bunker. The contributing factors were most likely: - the PIC's interruptions in flight work and, as a consequence, the loss of flight skills in aircraft piloting; - failure to comply with the operator's RPM requirements in terms of training flight personnel on the An-2 aircraft; - lack of a tail wheel locking mechanism on the An-2 RA-01430 aircraft; - takeoff using the rated engine power with the flaps extended to the 20Â° position, which does not correspond to the Airplane Flight Manual of the An-2 aircraft, when taking off from a site with a non-uniform surface (take off at the engine takeoff power with the flaps deflected by 30Â°).Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight was in day visual meteorological conditions (VMC) with the visibility greater than 20 miles.  About 20 miles NW of the REDFN waypoint, near airway Q105, the flight experienced a single 'joltÃ¢â¬Â of severe turbulence, which caused the autopilot to disconnect, and the airplane to roll about 30 degrees to the right and climb about 300 feet. The PF took control and returned the airplane to its assigned altitude and reengaged the autopilot.  When the turbulence occurred beverage service had recently concluded, and two flight attendants were in the aisle collecting trash. One flight attendant was in the aft galley securing service items and was thrown to the ceiling and fell, fracturing his left ankle. Ten passengers who were not seated or who were not using their seatbelts sustained minor injuries. The fasten seatbelt indication to passengers was turned off.

The pilot performed a forced landing in a field 2 km west of Teuge Airport next to the A50 motorway.  The right wing impacted a billboard and the aircraft swung while coming to a stop against a crash barrier next to the highway. On the morning of the accident, the aircraft was parked inside the hangar of a maintenance organisation for a maintenance task before the planned flights that day. When the aircraft was on ground with the engine off, erratic and high engine Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT) readings were reported. The maintenance organisation suspected a faulty magnetic pick-up in the engineÂs propeller governor to be the cause of these erratic EGT readings. A mechanic under supervision of a licenced engineer was tasked to replace the magnetic pick-up. After removal of the old magnetic pick-up, the mechanic followed steps one through four of the maintenance manual to install the new magnetic pick-up. Steps five through eight, a system voltage test to check correct installation, were not noticed by the mechanic and as a result not carried out. After connecting the wiring and tightening the lock nut, the mechanic, together with the pilot, did a static engine test run and performed the Single Red Line (SRL) check to verify the system and EGT readings. After the system was found to be functioning correctly, the mechanic left the aircraft and the pilot taxied to the skydive organisationÂs building to pick up parachutists. Following the boarding of seventeen parachutists, the pilot taxied to runway 26 and commenced the takeoff roll. Shortly after takeoff, without any warning, the engine lost power at approximately 400 feet above field level. The pilot made an emergency landing in a field whereby the aircraft sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, wings, landing gear and propeller. One parachutist suffered minor injuries. CONCLUSIONS:  During the initial climb after takeoff, the aircraft suffered a complete loss of engine power as a result of the uncommanded feathering of the propeller. This feathering was the result of damage that occurred within the propeller governor. Most probably, the incorrect installation of the magnetic pick-up in the propeller governor prior to the accident flight led to contact damage between the pick-up and the rotating toothed gear. Debris restricted the free movement of the ball head assembly in the governor housing, allowing all oil to drain from the propeller dome and causing the propeller to continuously move to the feather position and eventually cease rotation. The increasing pitch of the propeller led to a power reduction of the engine which reinforced itself. The distorted output signal of the damaged magnetic pick-up did not cause the engine flame out. The design of the propeller governorÂs toothed gear makes it possible to position the magnetic pick-up in between its teeth. The maintenance procedure for the replacement of the magnetic pick-up did not specifically mention or address this. The final steps of this procedure, a voltage check to verify the correct placement of the pick-up, were not performed by the maintenance staff. The design of the toothed gear in combination with the procedure in the maintenance manual allowed for the incorrect installation.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Dutch Safety Board Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: http://airdatasearch.com/reg/PH-FST  omroepgelderland.nl   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The distribution of persons with reduced mobility on board the aeroplane, between the different specialist vehicles upon arrival was not shared with the crew prior to the landing and the matter was only addressed after the other passengers had disembarked. The cabin crew then had to manage an unplanned situation involving a number of passengers wanting to board a specialist vehicle beyond the vehicle?s capacity, when all of the aeroplane?s occupants were fatigued from the flight.A PRM and her travel companion did not want to be separated and chose to use the disembarkation steps to stay together. The heavy workload associated with the confused situation, as well as the behaviour (described as aggressive) of the travel companion, prevented the crew members, the arrival agent and the assistance personnel from spotting in time that the passenger was descending the steps alone and unaided. She subsequently tripped during her descent and fell to the bottom of the steps.The emergency services were alerted in compliance with the procedures in force. The public emergency services took longer to arrive than the average response time for this type of intervention at Paris-Charles de Gaulle. The crew members considered the response time to be too long, likely due to the perceived severity of the medical emergency and to their knowledge of the usually very quick response times of the ARFF in the aeronautical domain.Due to the lack of updates on the expected arrival time of the emergency services, the captain decided to issue a MAYDAY to put an end to his uncertainty. This alert, which was issued several minutes before the arrival of the emergency services mobilised first, led to the subsequent mobilisation of substantial fire fighting resources.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: https://bea.aero/en/investigation-reports/notified-events/detail/accident-to-the-airbus-a350-registered-f-htyh-operated-by-air-france-on-29-06-2021-at-paris-charles-de-gaulle/ History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  21 January 2024 F-HTYH Air France 0 TorontoâLester B.

Inouye International Airport, HI (HNL/PHNL)","Kahului Airport, HI (OGG/PHOG)","Accident investigation report completed and information captured","Transair flight 810, a Boeing 737-200C cargo plane, ditched in Mamala Bay off Honolulu, Hawaii, after experiencing an engine anomaly after takeoff. The captain sustained serious injuries, the first officer sustained minor injuries, and the  airplane was destroyed. The aircraft took off from runway 08R at Honolulu-Daniel K. Inouye International Airport at 01:33 hours local time on a cargo flight to Kahului International Airport (OGG). As the aircraft climbed to an altitude of about 390 feet, at an airspeed of 155 knots, the EPR of the right engine dropoped to 1.43 for a period of two seconds. The aircraft then began to yaw to the right. The co-pilot corrected the tendency by using the left rudder. He stated that engine number 2 (right) had failed, which was confirmed by the captain. Upon reaching 2000 feet, the first officer (who was Pilot Flying) selected flight idle thrust. In the meantime the captain radioed Honolulu Tower that they had an emergency  The captain then instructed the co-pilot to maintain a speed of 220 knots, an altitude of 2000 feet and a heading of 240Â°. This heading the controller had given to Transair 809 on the same radio frequency about 52 seconds before. About 3 minutes and 14 seconds after the loss of power in the right engine, the captain took control of the aircraft; at that time the aircraft's speed was 224 knots and the heading was 242Â°. By then, the altitude of the aircraft had dropped from about 2100 feet to 1690 feet.  The captain pulled the nose up slightly, allowing the aircraft to climb to 1878 feet, but at the expense of airspeed, which dropped to 196 knots. Although it was determined immediately after takeoff that the right engine had failed, the crew again tried to establish the failing engine. The co-pilot then noted that the left engine had failed. The captain accepted the copilot's assessment and took no action to verify the information.  He moved the throttle of the right engine forward. The co-pilot then asked the captain if they should ""go back to the airport"" before the plane would be ""too far away."" The captain replied that the plane would stay within 15 miles of the airport. This would not interfere with other traffic and give them time to address the engine problem.  He then instructed the co-pilot to run the engine failure checklist.  While working checklist, the co-pilot noticed that the right engine's exhaust temperature (EGT) was in the red. He indicated that the power on the right engine should be reduced. The captain then decided that they  should return to the airport. Since they can no longer see the airport, Honolulu Tower issued heading instructions. Meanwhile the EGT remains deep in the red. The captain instructed the co-pilot to proceed with the engine failure checklist. But moments later, the co-pilot stopped again and stated, ""this engine is no good, we need to shut it down."" The captain agreed and ordered the right engine to be shut down.  The captain then began to steer the back toward the airport. The altitude was then only 320 feet at a speed of 180 knots. About 27 seconds before the crash, the left EPR was increased to 1.62, and the airspeed dropped to 156 knots. The captain then increased power on the left engine to maximum continuous power (1.95 EPR), but the aircraft hit the water, eleven and a half minutes after takeoff, 5.5 miles southwest of Honolulu Airport. Both pilots were able to escape from the sinking plane. The Coast Guard was alerted and an MH-65 Dolphin helicopter was on scene around 02:30. The captain was hanging from the floating tail section of the plane and the co-pilot was lying on top of floating wreckage. The captain was lifted from the water to the helicopter with the help of a rescue diver. The diver then re-entered the water and swam with the co-pilot to the rescue boat, which arrived at the scene around 02:40. The wreckage sank to a depth of about 105 meters and was salvaged in Octobter 2021. The subsequent investigation shows that two high-pressure turbine blades (Nos. 1 and 6) of the right engine had fractured. They failed by stress rupture resulting from a loss of loadbearing material due to oxidation and corrosion. Probable Cause and Findings: The flight crewmembersÂ misidentification of the damaged engine (after leveling off the airplane and reducing thrust) and their use of only the damaged engine for thrust during the remainder of the flight, resulting in an unintentional descent and forced ditching in the Pacific Ocean. Contributing to the accident were the flight crewÂs ineffective crew resource management, high workload, and stress.METAR: 10:53 UTC / 00:53 local time: PHNL 021053Z 07013KT 10SM FEW025 SCT045 26/18 A3004 RMK AO2 SLP170 T0256018311:53 UTC / 01:53 local time: PHNL 021153Z 06010G21KT 10SM FEW025 SCT050 26/17 A3003 RMK AO2 SLP169 60000 T02560172 10267 20256 56008Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA21FA174 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: cnbc.com   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; off Honolulu-Daniel K.

Of the 181 passengers and crew onboard, one flight attendant was seriously injured. The airplane was not damaged. The regularly scheduled passenger flight was operating under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 from the Dallas-Fort Worth International airport (KDFW), Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, to KMIA.    According to the flight crew, they observed convective activity that they would descend through during the approach and informed the lead flight attendant to prepare the cabin early and to take their seats. The weather radar was on, and the seatbelt sign was illuminated.  Shortly after this, as they descended through between 12,000-10,000 feet, the airplane passed through the tops of a small cumulus buildup and the flight experienced moderate turbulence.  When the turbulence was encountered, the #3 flight attendant (FA), located in the aft galley, was thrown into the air and was seriously injured after striking the floor hard.  The FAs informed the flight crew of the injury and the captain requested paramedics meet the flight at the gate.  After landing, the flight attendant was transported to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a fractured compressed vertebra. Probable Cause: an inadvertent encounter with convective turbulence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA21LA176 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA21LA176  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates02-Jun-2022 19:28 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

It went down a dropoff. The aircraft was operating an ambulance flight to pick up a Covid-19 patient. Diamantina Airport has a single asphalt runway (03/21), measuring 1610 x 30 m. Past the paved runway surface of runway 03 there is a 60 m stopway, followed by downsloping terrain. Contributing factors: - Application of controls - contributed. Considering that the distance ahead of the aircraft at the moment of touchdown (600 m) was not sufficient to decelerate and stop the plane within the runway limits, it was found that an inadequacy in the use of flight controls led to a long landing, where, from the touchdown point, there was not enough runway to safely stop the aircraft. - Attitude - undetermined. The fact that the PIC (PM) had already conducted several flights with the SIC (PF) without any issues, as well as their close relationship, may have contributed to an attitude of excessive confidence and resulted in a non-assertive perception of the approach parameters during this phase of the flight. - Cockpit coordination - contributed. The account of the events leading up to the landing indicated that the available human resources for aircraft operation were not adequately utilized, as the PIC (PM) only noticed the deviations that led to this runway excursion on short final, characterizing inefficient cockpit coordination as a contributing factor to the studied accident. - Fatigue - undetermined. Based on the medical examinations conducted after the accident, as well as the overall picture observed by the medical representative, it was inferred that the lack of response from the SIC (PF) to the PIC's (PM) alerts and impairment to his alertness could be indicative of the pilot experiencing fatigue-related effects that may have interfered with his performance. - Perception - contributed. The attempt to land even in the face of an unstable approach characterized an inadequate perception of the risks involved in continuing this procedure under the experienced conditions. - Pilot judgment - contributed. The decision to proceed with the landing, even after conducting an unstable approach to a position where only 600 m of runway would remain for the aircraft to stop, as well as the failure to consider the alternative of a go-around, characterized an inadequate judgment regarding the risks of the operation conducted under the circumstances.Accident investigation:   Report number: A-001/CENIPA/2021 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: g1.globo.com  itatiaia.com.br   Location  Images: photo (c) Corpo de Bombeiros Militar de Minas Gerais; Diamantina Airport, MG (DTI); 02 January 2021 photo (c) Corpo de Bombeiros Militar de Minas Gerais; Diamantina Airport, MG (DTI); 02 January 2021 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot was killed in the accident. The aircraft departed Troutdale Airport, Oregon at 22:08 UTC. After departure, while in contact with  Portland Approach and subsequently Seattle Center, the pilot had problems following the controllers' instructions with regards to  headings and radio frequency. The aircraft was cleared to climb to FL370 by Seattle Center and continued to climb, until 13:28:45, when it reached its highest altitude of 31,000 ft. The airplane began to descend, and remained for the next eight minutes in a spiraling and descending 1-mile radius right turn. The last ADS-B target was recorded at 13:36:27, with the airplane on a northwest heading at an altitude of 3,800 ft. The airplane struck the ground in the Mutton Mountain Range, at an elevation of 3,600 ft.  FAA records did not indicate that the pilot held a type rating for the Citation 560. He had taken Citation 560 training toward the end of 2020 at a training facility in Arizona, however the owner of the facility stated that the pilot had not performed to a level sufficient to be issued a type rating or single pilot exemption.  During the training, he struggled significantly in high workload environments and had difficulty operating the airplaneÂs avionics suite, which had recently been installed. He revealed to a fellow pilot that he preferred to Âhand flyÂ the airplane rather than use the autopilot. Review of historical flight data, and statements provided by acquaintances of the pilot, indicate that this was likely the first time he had flown the airplane on his own.

All 56 passengers and 6 crew members died in the accident. The aircraft, a Boeing 737-500 registered PK-CLC, arrived at Jakarta-Soekarno-Hatta International Airport at 12:11 hours local time after a flight from Pangkal Pinang. The subsequent flight for the aircraft, SJ182, was due to depart at 13:40. Weather at the airport was poor with heavy rainfall and low clouds due to a thunderstorm in de vicinity. This caused a delay in departure. At 14:18 the aircraft was cleared to taxi to runway 25R. Take-off from runway 32R was commenced at 14:35 (07:35 UTC).  At 14:36:46, the pilot contacted the Terminal East (TE) controller and was cleared for an unrestricted climb to FL290. Five seconds later, at altitude of 1,980 feet, the Autopilot (AP) system engaged. At 14:38:42, as the aircraft climbed past 8150 feet, the thrust lever of the left engine started reducing, while the thrust lever of the right engine remained in position. FDR data showed that the left engine N1 was decreasing whereas the right engine N1 remained the same. Nine seconds later flight requested a heading change to 075Â° to avoid weather conditions, which was approved by the TE controller. At 14:40:05, the aircraft reached the highest altitude of about 10,900 feet. The autopilot system disengaged at that point with a heading of 016Â°, the pitch angle was about 4.5Â° nose up, and the aircraft rolled to the left to more than 45Â°. The thrust lever position of the left engine continued decreasing while the right engine thrust lever remained in position. Five seconds later the the autothrottle (A/T) system disengaged and the pitch angle was more than 10Â° nose down. The aircraft had entered a high speed descent and impacted the surface of the sea about 20 seconds later. The wreckage was located and appeared to be distributed across an area of about 80 by 110 meters on the seabed at a depth of approximately 16 meters. The Indonesian NTSC reported on February 10 that the aircraft had a repeating issue the autothrottle in the days before the accident.  On 3 January 2021, a pilot reported that the autothrottle was unserviceable. An engineer rectified the problem by cleaning the autothrottle computerÂs electrical connector. After re-installation, the Built-in Test Equipment (BITE) test result was good.  On 4 January 2021, a pilot again reported that the autothrottle was unserviceable. An engineer tried cleaning the autothrottle computerÂs electrical connector but the problem remained and it was transferred to the Deferred Maintenance Items. On 5 January 2021, an engineer rectified the problem by cleaning the autothrottle Takeoff and Go Around (TOGA) switch and conducted a BITE test on the autothrottle computer. The BITE test result was good. Contributing Factors: - The corrective maintenance processes of the A/T problem were unable to identify the friction or binding within the mechanical system of the thrust lever and resulted in the prolonged and unresolved of the A/T problem. - The right thrust lever did not reduce when required by the A/P to obtain selected rate of climb and aircraft speed due to the friction or binding within the mechanical system, as a result, the left thrust lever compensated by moving further backward which resulted in thrust asymmetry. - The delayed CTSM activation to disengage the A/T system during the thrust asymmetry event due to the undervalued spoiler angle position input resulted in greater power asymmetry. - The automation complacency and confirmation bias might have led to a decrease in active monitoring which resulted in the thrust lever asymmetry and deviation of the flight path were not being monitored. - The aircraft rolled to the left instead of to the right as intended while the control wheel deflected to the right and inadequate monitoring of the EADI might have created assumption that the aircraft was rolling excessively to the right which resulted in an action that was contrary in restoring the aircraft to safe flight parameters. - The absence of the guidance of the national standard for the UPRT, may have contributed to the training program not being adequately implemented to ensure that pilots have enough knowledge to prevent and recover of an upset condition effectively and timely.METAR: 07:00 UTC / 14:00 local time: WIII 090700Z 30007KT 4000 VCTS RA FEW016CB OVC018 25/24 Q1007 NOSIG07:30 UTC / 14:30 local time: WIII 090730Z 30006KT 5000 -RA FEW017CB OVC018 25/24 Q1006 NOSIG08:00 UTC / 15:00 local time: WIII 090800Z 28008KT 4000 -RA BKN016 OVC018 26/24 Q1006 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSC Report number: KNKT.21.01.01.04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Antara  Flightradar24 track   Location  Images: photo (c) Leslie Snelleman; Balikpapan-Sepingan Airport (BPN/WALL); 09 November 2017 photo (c) M.

There were 64 people onboard: 2 flight crewmembers, 12 cabin crewmembers, and 50 passengers.  After entering Nicosia flight information region (LCCC FIR), Cyprus, during descent, the aircraft encountered moderate to severe air turbulence that lasted for approximately three minutes. The turbulence caused injuries to seven occupants.  The en route significant weather chart (SIGWX) contained in the operational flight plan (OFP) forecasted occasional isolated embedded cumulonimbus (CB) clouds affecting Nicosia FIR and Beirut FIR (OLBB). The OFP did not contain any significant meteorological information (SIGMET).  During the preflight briefing, the commander alerted the cabin crew about the possibility of in-flight turbulence during the descent to OLBA. On 17 January 2021, Larnaca International Airport (LCLK) meteorological watch office (MWO) issued several SIGMET of thunderstorms and severe turbulence affecting areas within LCCC FIR. The flight crew were not aware of the SIGMET issued by LCLK when the aircraft entered LCCC FIR.  With the aircraft at the top of descent (at FL360 within LCCC FIR), the commander, who was the pilot flying (PF), instructed the cabin crew to secure the cabin as he anticipated turbulence during descent and switched the seatbelt sign to ON. About three minutes into descent, at approximately 0804 UTC with the aircraft passing pressure altitude 29,200 ft, the aircraft started to encounter turbulence. The Copilot immediately made a passenger announcement for cabin crew to take their seats. Soon after, the aircraft encountered moderate to severe air turbulence. The flight crew believed the turbulence was âclear air turbulenceâ because there was no weather radar returns of precipitation displayed on the navigation display.  During the turbulence, the aircraft autopilot and autothrottle remained engaged and the aircraft remained inside its flight envelope. The turbulence-generated acceleration forces caused several unsecured cabin crewmembers and passengers to be forcefully lifted off their feet and impact cabin furnishings resulting in a serious injury to one passenger. There was no reported damage to the aircraft cabin.  The flight continued to the destination where the aircraft landed uneventfully. Causes The Air Accident Investigation Sector determines that the cause of the Accident was the significant vertical g-forces imposed on the Aircraft because of severe clear air turbulence, which caused an unsecured passenger to be forcefully lifted off her feet and impact cabin furnishings resulting in her right foot fracture serious injury. Contributory Factors (a) The influence of the jet stream and thunderstorm in the flight path area was significant enough to produce severe turbulence. (b) The flight crew decision making lacked critical information contained in SIGMET 3 issued by LCLK MWO (covering the period from 0530 to 0930) which forecasted severe turbulence between FL260 and FL390, south of latitude N3430. (c) The format of the SIGMET issued by LCLK MWO was different from the recommendations contained in ICAO Annex 3 and EU regulation No. 2020/469 such that the Weather Services International Fusion application (WSI Fusion) applied by the Operatorâs flight dispatch department did not generate a timely alert for SIGMET 3 report issued by LCLK MWO.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: GCAA Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: GCAA Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

The towing route followed the edge of the apron, which was damp and downhill, and involved a 90Â° left turn to line up for start. A combination of unfamiliarity with a relatively new operating base, towing in reverse and difficulty interpreting ""indistinct"" taxiway markings meant the tug driver entered the left turn later than intended. The late entry made the turn excessively tight, and the tug lost traction on the damp surface and jack-knifed. The resulting combination of a sharp towing angle and the aircraftÂs downhill momentum caused the towbar shear pin to break. The commander applied the brakes immediately on hearing ""the sound of snapping metal"" but was unable to prevent the aircraft rolling forward into the tug. The operatorÂs internal investigation report made several safety recommendations, including a review of towing procedures, enhanced driver training, the use of radios by towing teams and improvements to taxiway markings. The company also reviewed its apron risk assessment and towing was added to their audit plan. On 10 February 2021 the aircraft was ferried to Cranfield for repairs. On 1 July 2021 the aircraft was flown back to London-Biggin Hill Airport.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: AAIB-27100 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

During the cruise the crew independently calculated the landing performance. Runway 26 at Exeter Airport (EXT) was forecast to be wet, so they planned to use Flap 40 for the landing, with Autobrake 3. With both pilots being familiar with EXT the co-pilot, who was Pilot Flying (PF), conducted a short brief of the pertinent points for the approach.  From the ATIS they noted that the weather seemed to be better than forecast and the surface wind was from 230Â° at 11 kt. The ATC provided the flight crew with radar vectors from ATC to the ILS on Runway 26 at EXT. The landing gear was lowered and Flap 25 selected before the aircraft intercepted the glideslope. Flap 40 (the landing flap) was selected on the glideslope just below 2000 ft amsl. With a calculated VREF of 134 kt and a surface wind of 10 kt the PF planned to fly the approach with a VAPP of 140 kt. At about 10 nm finals, upon looking at the flight management computer, the captain, who was Pilot Monitoring (PM), noticed there was a 30 kt headwind, so a VAPP of 144 kt was selected on the Mode Control Panel (MCP). The crew became visual with the runway at about 1000 ft aal. The PF then disconnected the Auto Pilot and Auto Throttle; the Flight Directors remained on. As the wind was now starting to decrease, the VAPP was then reduced from 142 to 140 kt at about 600 ft aal. As the wind reduced, towards the 10 kt surface wind, the PF made small adjustments to the power to maintain the IAS at or close to VAPP. At 500 ft radio altimeter (RA) the approach was declared stable by the crew, as per their standard operating procedures. At this point the aircraft had a pitch attitude of 2.5Â° nose down, the IAS was 143 kt, the rate of descent (ROD) was about 860 ft/min, the engines were operating at about 68% N1 and the aircraft was 0.4 dots above the glideslope. However, the ROD was increasing and soon thereafter was in excess of 1,150 ft/min. This was reduced to about 300 ft/min but soon increased again. At 320 ft RA, the aircraft went below the glideslope for about 8 seconds and, with a ROD of 1,700 ft/min, a 'SINK RATE' GPWS alert was enunciated. The PF acknowledged this and corrected the flightpath to bring the aircraft back to the glideslope before stabilizing slightly above the glideslope; the PM called this deviation too. As the PF was correcting back to the glideslope the PM did not feel there was a need to take control. During this period the maximum recorded deviation was 3/4 of a dot below the glideslope. At about 150 ft RA, with a ROD of 1,300 ft/min, there was a further 'SINK RATE' GPWS alert, to which the PM said, 'watch that sink rate ', followed by another 'Sink Rate' alert, which the PF responded by saying 'and back...' The commander recalled that as the aircraft crossed the threshold, at about 100 ft, the PF retarded the throttles, pitched the aircraft nose down, from about 5Â° nose up to 4Â° nose down, and then applied some power in the last few feet. During these final moments before the landing, there was another 'Sink Rate' alert. The result was a hard landing. A 'Pull Up' warning was also triggered by the GPWS, but it was not audible on the CVR. The last surface wind transmitted by ATC, just before the landing, was from 230Â° at 10 kt. During the rollout the commander took control, selected the thrust reversers and slowed down to taxi speed. After the aircraft had vacated the runway at Taxiway Bravo it became apparent the aircraft was listing to the left. During the After Landing checks the co-pilot tried to select Flaps Up, but they would not move. There was then a Hydraulic LP caution. As there was still brake accumulator pressure the crew were content to taxi the aircraft slowly the short distance onto Stand 10. Once on stand the listing became more obvious. It was then that the crew realised there was something 'seriously wrong' with the aircraft. After they had shut the aircraft down, the flight crew requested that the wheels were chocked, and the aircraft be connected to ground power before going outside to inspect the aircraft. Once outside a hydraulic leak was found. The fuselage skin aft of the wings was cracked and buckled, and the rear fuselage was distorted downward. The crown skin was creased and rippled along most of the fuselage. Both main landing gear shock absorbers were found to be bottomed, and the left main landing gear beam was distorted upwards such that the aircraft was approximately 2Â° left-wing low. he flap drive mechanism was damaged, and the left-wing inboard driveshaft was bent; the left inboard gearbox casing and its mountings were broken. The maximum vertical acceleration recorded by the FDR on touchdown was 3.8g, at this point there was 3Â° of left roll. Conclusion: The aircraft suffered a hard landing as a result of the approach being continued after it became unstable after the aircraft had past the point where the crew had declared the approach stable and continued. Despite high rates of descent being observed beyond the stable point, together with associated alerts the crew elected to continue to land. Had the approach been discontinued and a GA flown, even at a low height, while the aircraft may have touched down the damage sustained may have been lessened. While the OM did not specifically state that an approach was to remain stable beyond the gate on the approach, the FCTM was specific that, if it did not remain stable, a GA should be initiated. The commander may have given the co-pilot the benefit of doubt and believed she had the ability to correct an approach that became unstable in the final few hundred feet of the approach. However, had there been any doubt, a GA should be executed.METAR: 02:20 UTC / 02:20 local time: EGTE 190220Z 23010KT 9000 -RA SCT012 BKN040 12/10 Q1009=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: AAIB-27092 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: AAIB   Location  Images: photo (c) AAIB; Exeter Airport (EXT); January 2021 photo (c) AAIB; Exeter Airport (EXT); January 2021 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The runway was temporally closed for inspection, but found nothing abnormal.  There were no injuries among two crew members.   PROBABLE CAUSES The JTSB concludes that the probable cause of this accident was that when the Aircraft made a go-around while becoming unstable attitude after touching down and bouncing, the pitch angle became excessively large with an inadequate aircraft speed, which more likely resulted in the lower aft fuselage contacting with the runway. The Aircraft bounced after the touchdown is because it was likely insufficient to deal with the crosswind. The pitch angle became excessively large with an inadequate aircraft speed is probably because the PIC reflexively moved the reverse thrust levers after the touchdown, therefore, in the situation where it took time for the aircraft speed to increase due to the go-around operation, while being anxious about the runway-remaining length and others and trying to get off the ground as quickly as possible, the PIC performed the nose-up operation without checking the aircraft speed.METAR: UTC /  local time: RJAA 011030Z 18009KT 9999 FEW025 10/05 Q1017 WS R16R NOSIG RMK 1CU025 A3003= UTC /  local time: RJAA 011000Z 21009KT 9999 FEW025 10/06 Q1017 NOSIG RMK 1CU025  A3005= UTC /  local time: RJAA 010930Z 16006KT 140V200 9999 FEW020 SCT130 09/06 Q1018  NOSIG RMK 1CU020 3AC130 A3006=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JTSB Report number: AA2023-5 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: JTSB History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  28 March 2018 JA13KZ Nippon Cargo Airlines 0 between Los Angeles and San Francisco min Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates11-Feb-2025 15:39 ASN Updated [Source, Narrative, Accident report, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

According to the flight crew, just prior to top of descent the captain informed the flight attendants to prepare the cabin early because there was weather in the vicinity of the arrival airport. Shortly after that, the first officer (FO), who was the pilot flying, initiated the descent.  Air traffic control then cleared the flight to a lower altitude and requested they increase their descent. The FO complied, and increased their vertical speed, however, at some point, he engaged ""open descent"" mode. The FO saw the airspeed increasing towards red line and he pulled back on the stick and the autopilot disengaged. The captain said he then took control using the autopilot disconnect/priority switch and applied aft stick pressure to return the airplane to a normal descent pitch attitude to prevent an overspeed. According to the flight crew, the airplane was in clear air and smooth flight conditions when the event occurred. Two flight attendants (FA) in the aft galley, were thrown into the air and onto the floor. The captain was notified that one of the FAs had been injured and would need assistance when they got to the gate. A deadheading FA assumed the injured FAs duties for the remainder of the flight.  After landing, the FA was transported to a local hospital and diagnosed with a fractured ankle. Probable Cause: An abrupt flight control input by the flight crew during descent that caused a flight attendant to fall and fracture their ankle.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA21LA082 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA21LA082  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

It came down hard and the main gears and the nose gear broke. The plane slid on the runway and a fire broke out. The plane came to a stop to the left of the runway. Contributing factors: The three accidents discussed in the BEA final report have some similarities and highlight the difficulty for a crew to make an appropriate decision about using de-ice systems in icing conditions.  This decision is influenced by the high operational constraints due to the landing performance limitations in icing conditions on this type of plane. The extent of the landing performance penalties in icing conditions, compared to landing performance in non-icing conditions on this type of aircraft results in crews frequently encountering situations where the destination airport is accessible with comfortable safety margins in non -icing conditions but becomes inaccessible if the conditions are icing (i.e. total outside temperature below 5Â°C and visible moisture on approach, even in the absence of any signs of accretion on the aircraft). This may lead crews, both during flight planning and while carrying out the flight, to underestimate the risk of encountering icing conditions during the approach and landing in order to comply with the requested flight schedule or to avoid a diversion. Although compliance with the Flight Manual procedures is mandatory, the commercial pressures associated with this type of operation may encourage crews not to comply with the proper procedures for the approach and landing in icing conditions by deactivating the de-ice systems as soon as they visually observe that the leading edges of the wings are free of ice, and they consider that the risk of further contamination before landing is low. The statements gathered during the investigation suggest that this inadequate practice is common in the Phenom 100 pilot community. The following factors may have contributed to the crew not diverting and to them continuing the approach without the activation of the de-ice system: - The operator's choice to use an aeroplane type for flights to destinations where icing conditions on approach are not unlikely, although the performance of this aeroplane type is degraded in icing conditions and becomes incompatible with the runway landing distances available, even though these runway landing distances provide substantial margins in the absence of icing conditions. - The degraded landing performance of the Embraer EMB-500 Phenom 100 in icing conditions compared to performance in non-icing conditions. Crews thus frequently encounter situations where the destination airport is accessible with comfortable safety margins in non-icing conditions but becomes inaccessible in icing conditions. - A deviation in the application of the de-ice/anti-icing system activation procedure, due to the landing performance penalties in icing conditions on this aircraft type, which does not appear to be limited to this crew or this operator. Instead of activating the wing and horizontal stabilizer de-ice system as soon as the temperature drops below 5Â°C in the presence of visible moisture, this system is only activated by the crews when they visually observe ice on the leading edges of the wing. It is then deactivated as soon as these crews note the absence of ice on the leading edges of the wings and consider that the risk of further ice accumulation before landing is low.METAR: 09:30 UTC / 10:30 local time: LFPB 080930Z AUTO 36005KT 320V040 5000 BR OVC011 M01/M03 Q0998 BECMG BKN02010:00 UTC / 11:00 local time: LFPB 081000Z AUTO 01004KT 320V040 5000 BR OVC011 M01/M03 Q0998 BECMG BKN02010:30 UTC / 11:30 local time: LFPB 081030Z AUTO 34004KT 280V020 5000 BR OVC012 M01/M03 Q0998 BECMG BKN020Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Report number: BEA2021-0052 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: BEA   Location  Images: photo (c) BEA; Paris-Le Bourget Airport (LBG/LFPB) [F]; 08 February 2021; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) BEA; Paris-Le Bourget Airport (LBG/LFPB) [F]; 08 February 2021; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) James; Gloucestershire Airport (GLO/EGBJ); 17 March 2017; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane sustained substantial damage and the five occupants onboard were not injured. The flight crew later stated that at rotation speed, the captain applied back pressure to the control yoke; however, the nose did not rotate to a takeoff attitude. The captain attempted to rotate the airplane once more by relaxing the yoke then pulling it back again, and, with no change in the airplaneÂs attitude, he made the decision to reject the takeoff by retarding the thrust levers and applying maximum braking. The airplane overran the end of the runway onto a gravel pad where the landing gear collapsed.  The NTSB reported that the captain did not have a valid pilot certificate. A review of airmen records revealed that the FAA had issued an emergency revocation of all his certificates 2 years earlier on February 13, 2019. FAA records indicated that the reason for the emergency revocation was because he had falsified logbook entries and records for pilot proficiency checks, competency checks, and training events on 15 separate occasions while employed as a check pilot for a Part 135 operator. Probable Cause: The flight crewÂs operation of the airplane outside of the manufacturerÂs specified weight and balance limitations and with an improper trim setting, which resulted in the airplaneÂs inability to rotate during the attempted takeoff.

The aircraft was attached to the French Transport Squadron 3/61 Poitou, stationed at OrlÃ©ans Bricy Air Base (BA123). It had been equipped with a large diameter and low pressure wheel kit (IFG) for the last ten days. On the day of the accident the flight crew was to practice short field landings at Blois/Le Breuil Airfield. On the fifth landing, the pilot in command was at the controls in the right seat. He wanted to land the aircraft near the threshold of the asphalt runway 12/30, with a right crosswind of 13 kt and gusts to 18 kt. Upon contact with the ground, the crew heard a squeal of tires. The aircraft veered to the right. The right wing lifted and the left wing touched the ground in a right yaw. The aircraft exited the runway to the right and came to rest on a grass runway, 30 meters from the edge of the paved runway. Causes of the event: The causes of the event fall within the environmental, organizational, and human factors domains. The crosswind on landing was at the limits of the aircraft's operating range. The piloting of the Twin Otter, in crosswind conditions at the limits of use, is delicate and requires precision and reactivity. The constrained planning of the flights led the crew to carry out a light preparation of this flight. The recent modification of the aircraft with the half-balloon wheel kit was not sufficiently consolidated for a complete appropriation by the crews. In the absence of a formal authorization of use, the pilots discover by themselves the particularities of this new configuration. The crews have not taken the measure of the new phenomena brought by the change concerning the centering, the attitude of the aircraft and the increased effectiveness of the braking system. The crew, by a bias of habit, kept their usual reference points and acted on the controls by going to the maximum travel of these without being able to counter the drift and the slide which was installed. The repetition of the exercises since the first flight of the day could have led to a decrease in the captain's attention, favouring the occurrence of a piloting error linked to cognitive biases of habit. The ignorance of the particular phenomenon of the scrambling, known of this type of aircraft led to an underestimation of the risk associated with a very front centering. The characteristics of the mission could have favored a wrong perception of the risk. The important aeronautical experience of the crew contributed to a feeling of control. A culture of performance strongly permeates the crews of the squadron. This generates a higher level of risk acceptability. The hypovigilance of the captain is a contributing factor to the occurrence of a habit bias in this event. Finally, the pilot in the left seat adopted a passive posture due to the captain's experience, delaying the resumption of control.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA-E Report number: A-2021-01-A Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The two pilots on board were not injured. The flight crew briefed and set up for the instrument landing system approach (ILS) to runway 18, expecting to break out of the overcast cloud layer and execute a visual approach to runway 36 due to more favorable winds. Upon exiting the overcast the captain activated the airportÂs pilot controlled lighting system and the first officer saw the runway. Both pilots believed the runway that they saw was runway 36. They maneuvered the airplane visually toward the runway that was in-sight and executed a landing. Upon touchdown it became clear that they had inadvertently landed on runway 32, which they new was closed.  The airplane struck a snow berm at the edge of the intersection with runway 36, the landing gear broke from the airplane and the airplane slid to a stop. The airplane sustained damage to the landing gear, lower fuselage, wings and ventral strakes. The runway had been closed due to the large amount of snow. The runway was covered with about 4 inches of snow that had yet to be cleared. The airport manager noted that the runway lights were on due to the snowplow operations that were taking place as an aid in determining the location of the runway edge. There were no plow trucks on runway 32 at the time of the accident because they had stopped for a dinner break. Probable Cause: The flight crewÂs failure to verify the correct runway for landing, which resulted in a landing on a snow contaminated runway and resulting damage to the airplane. The illumination of the lights associated with the closed runway contributed to the accident.METAR: 00:15 UTC / 19:15 local time: KJVY 190015Z AUTO 36005KT 10SM OVC025 M01/M05 A3026 RMK AO2 T10151050 TSNO23:35 UTC / 18:35 local time: KJVY 182335Z AUTO 00000KT 10SM SCT025 BKN043 M01/M05 A3026 RMK AO2 T10141051 TSNO23:55 UTC / 18:55 local time: KJVY 182355Z AUTO 03003KT 10SM BKN025 OVC043 M01/M05 A3026 RMK AO2 T10151051 11005 21023 TSNOAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN21LA136 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: flightaware.com  NTSB   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All three on board were unhurt. During the final approach to runway 17 at Monfort, the right landing gear hit the ground hard, causing the aircraft to substantially change its trajectory and skid on the left side. The two engines impacted the ground and the propellers became detached. The aircraft finally came to rest on the runway with substantial damage. The three occupants were unharmed and left the aircraft under their own power. Probable Cause(s): Abnormal contact of the aircraft before the runway, as a result of an approach made at too low a landing angle, in an attempt by the crew to make a short landing. Contributing Factors The investigation process determined that the accident was caused by a combination of the following factors: - Loss of situational awareness of the crew, who neglected the position of the aircraft in relation to the terrain during the approach, when attempting to make a short landing, probably caused by overconfidence and by the Pilot in Command's maladjustment to flying, who was making his first flights after a 70-day inactivity, caused by health problems. - Deficient condition of the safety zone and runway thresholds, without demarcation and with unevenness, which contributed to the initial damage to the aircraft, fracture of the right landing gear and which triggered other damages to the aircraft. - Deficient airfield conditions, as it lacked the minimum signage, such as demarcation of the beginning, end and margins of the usable runway, airfield limits and wind indication; these limitations increased the crew's workload as they lacked basic guidance to perform the landing in a limited field. - Lack of supervision by the operator, who did not have a flight readjustment procedure for crews after a significant inactivity, and, instead, scheduled the Pilot to perform a demanding operation to a runway with limited conditions on the first day of his return to flight. - Lack of risk management on the part of the operator, who despite knowing the risk conditions of the Monfort runway, did not have the necessary defenses for an acceptably safe operation on it, nor did it take the necessary steps to improve its conditions with the aerodrome operator, the government of the department of VaupÃ©s. - Absence of surveillance of crews under stressful conditions, high workloads, taking into account that the company operates on restricted runways with a high probability of accidents, conditions that increase the risk considerably during the operation. - Absence of minimum signage on the runway, increasing the workload for the crew, considering that they never had a reference point to perform calculations or correct estimates during approach and landing.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Aerocivil Report number: COL-21-08-GIA Status: Investigation completedDuration: 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Aerocivil History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  24 January 2008 HK-2006 VIARCO 0 Teresita Airport sub 26 August 2020 HK-2006 ALIANSA Colombia 0 Jorge Enrique GonzÃ¡lez Torres Airport (SJE/SKSJ),San Jose del Guaviare min Location  Images: photo (c) Jaime Escobar; Barranquilla-Ernesto Cortissoz International Airport (BAQ/SKBQ); 12 December 2012 photo (c) Jaime Escobar; Barranquilla-Ernesto Cortissoz International Airport (BAQ/SKBQ); 12 December 2012 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates14-Feb-2025 10:24 ASN Updated The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Findings: The investigation concluded that the cause of the accident was that the aircraft was flying in icy conditions for a long period of time during an artificial rainfall operation and the wings and propellers became seriously iced up. The aircraft was unable to effectively control the risk of icing, which resulted in the aircraft losing speed and entering a spin, eventually crashing to the ground and catching fire. Based on the casualties and damage to the aircraft, the incident constituted a major general aviation accident of aircraft crew origin. The investigation also found that the aircraft had been modified in such a way that the relevant data was not available and that the crew did not handle the spin properly.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CAAC Report number: 20210301TFSQ01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: weibo.cn  finance.sina.com.cn   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The filed flight plan indicated that the flight would be conducted under the Visual Flight Rule (VFR). At 09:08 LT, in daylight conditions, the aircraft departed from Wamena. The pilot was the only person on board the aircraft and this flight was the second flight of the day for the pilot and the aircraft. Prior to the departure, there was no record or report of aircraft system malfunction. Considering that the aircraft altitude was higher than normal for the landing approach to runway 09 at Angguruk and attempting to avoid clouds, the pilot made several maneuvers over Angguruk. During that maneuver, the pilot noticed that the grass on the runway, about 50 meters from beginning of the runway 09 and the grass about 30 meters before the threshold of runway 09 had brighter color than the other grass. The pilot thought that the brighter color-grass was the grass that had been cut. When on final approach, the pilot noticed that the runway threshold markers were visible. The pilot recalled that the markers did not stand out as usual due to the color. The pilot also recalled that the area about 30 meters before the threshold runway 09 looked usable for landing, as the color was no different with the 50 meters of the beginning runway. The pilot planned to make touchdown in the very beginning of runway 09 as he did not want to use more braking to decelerate the aircraft. The aircraft touched down about 22 meters before the runway threshold, then veered to the left and stopped about 112 meters from the beginning runway 09 on heading 182Â°.

He corrected for the slide back towards the runway center line, but the airplane encountered a ""violent gust of wind"" and began to slide again. He applied right brake and right rudder while leaving in full right aileron, but the airplane had zero braking action. As the airplane continued to slide, he applied engine power in an attempt to increase the rudder authority and ""correct the direction back towards the runway"" to no avail. Subsequently, the airplane slid off the left side of the runway, the left wheel impacted a snowbank, and the airplane tipped to the left. The airplane came to rest in a nose down attitude, banked to the left at about a 40Â° angle, and sustained substantial damage to the left wing and aileron.

When passing 8,500 ft on vectors for a visual approach to KDFW, the crew heard another aircraft in the area report turbulence on the ATC frequency. Subsequently, the captain called the number 1 flight attendant (FA) to notify him of the potential turbulence and ensure the flight attendants took their jumpseats. Approaching the GACHO intersection at 6,500 feet, the crew stated the aircraft experienced a moderate 'jolt' of turbulence lasting about one second. The flight crew stated that the weather was unrestricted visibility and no precipitation in the vicinity of the turbulence encounter.   At the time of the turbulence, the FAs had completed securing the cabin.

Of the 66 passengers and crew onboard, one flight attendant sustained serious injuries. The airplane was not damaged. The regularly scheduled domestic passenger flight was operating under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 from Salt Lake City International Airport (KSLC), Salt Lake City, Utah to KLAX. According to witnesses, upon arrival at the gate in KLAX, the flight attendant (FA) fell from the top of the main cabin doorsteps to the ramp surface below after opening the main cabin door (MCD). She was then observed standing up, climbing back up the stairs and then falling to the ramp a second time. Ramp employees immediately came to her aid and alerted the captain of the flight who subsequently called company operations and requested emergency medical personnel be sent. She was transported to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a broken left wrist, right clavicle, and ribs.  Ramp video at KSLC showed the MCD was closed without pinning the handrails when the normal procedure was for the FA to call ground handling personnel to pin the railings before closing the door. The accident flight was the FAs first flight out of Initial Operating Experience, which was performed during a flight on an ERJ-175. Normal operating procedures for the CRJ-700 MCD requires the handrails to be up and pinned prior to closing the door, however, the FA did not indicate knowledge of that procedure requirement when interviewed following the accident. The FA also indicated during the interview that prior to landing, she hit her head on an open galley compartment door and felt disoriented, dizzy, and nauseated. Subsequent to the accident, the operator issued two safety bulletins to their employees describing the lessons learned from this accident and reviewing the opening procedures for the CRJ MCD. The operator also added CRJ door operation as a top safety focus area and required a demonstration of the CRJ MCD operation to the curriculum for those FAs being instructed on ERJ-175's.    Probable Cause: the improper retraction of the main cabin door, which resulted in the flight attendant falling when she opened the door at the destination.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA21LA096 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA21LA096  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates04-Jun-2022 06:53 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

After completing the photogrammetric flight and landing at Gdansk-Lech Walesa Airport (EPGD), the airplane was parked on apron 1, stand No 1. Due to the planned return flight, the pilot submitted the flight plan and then he was waiting for a decision of his operations office. In the meantime he inspected the airplane, checked the fuel and oil quantity, and, among other things, the presence of chocks under the nose landing gear. Then he stayed in the cockpit and after about 40 minutes the pilot received the decision to return to EPRZ alone. The pilot performed the preflight procedure, started the engines, checked their operating parameters and asked the TWR for clearance to taxi to runway in use. Having received the clearance, the pilot increased the engines speed, but the airplane did not move. The pilot realized that he had not removed the chocks and left the cockpit with the engines running to remove the chocks. The pilot did not remember whether he had pulled the parking brake lever before leaving the cockpit. Having left the cockpit, the pilot moved to the area of the nose landing gear and removed the chocks, and at that point the airplane began to move. The pilot tried to stop the airplane, but tripped over the previously removed chocks and fell down. The airplane taxied over the pilot and moved towards the taxiway L. The pilot tried to catch up with the moving airplane, but failed to do so. The P68 airplane crossed taxiway L and hit the rear part of a Saab 340A, SP-KPU, parked at stand number 32. As a result of the collision, both airplanes were substantially damaged.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: SCAAI Report number: 2021 / 0572 Status: Duration: Download report: Sources: SCAAI  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates08-Jul-2024 07:47 ASN Updated The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Of the 50 passengers and crew onboard, one passenger sustained serious injuries and the first officer, flight attendant, and one passenger sustained minor injuries. The airplane was not damaged. The regularly scheduled domestic passenger flight was operating under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 from Tri-cities Airport (KTRI), Blountville, TN.  The flight crew stated they expected turbulence on arrival into KCLT, because they had flown in from KCLT on the flight prior to the accident flight. As a result, prior to pushback of the accident flight, the captain made a public address announcement that the fasten seatbelt sign would remain on and the passengers and flight attendants (FA) should remain seated for the entirety of the flight. As the flight was being vectored around severe convective activity on arrival into KCLT and approaching 12,000 feet, they encountered severe turbulence with downdrafts. The autopilot disconnected and the airplane descended below its assigned level off altitude. The first officer, who was the pilot flying, took manual control of the airplane and began climbing back to 12,000 feet. After exiting the turbulent conditions, the captain called the FA and was informed that one passenger had been injured.  According to the FA, a passenger got up while the seatbelt sign was on and was in the lavatory when the turbulence was encountered. The passenger complained of back pain as she returned back to her seat after the event. Two medically qualified passengers assisted the injured passenger inflight. After landing, paramedics transported the injured passenger to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a fractured vertebrae.   At the time of the flight's arrival into KCLT, a SIGMET was active for imbedded thunderstorms and turbulence.

The aircraft was pushed back from Stand 2 onto taxiway I and the tow proceeded along taxiway I and taxiway J, crossing runway 23. As the tow truck turned onto taxiway K, the tow bar became detached and the aircraft proceeded straight, entering the cargo and GSE Area and coming to rest against a bank of 4 fuel bowsers parked side by side. Conclusions: Aircraft towing is a routine operation that, despite its relatively mundane nature, requires careful operation and stringent safety procedures to ensure that incidents and accidents are avoided. This accident occurred due to a lack of adherence to such procedures, including: 1) Proper flight deck checks and aircraft setup for a towing procedure; 2) Adequate coordination between ground staff and the tug driver to ensure a safe environment that avoids the need of sudden braking by the tug; 3) Careful checking of the shear pins following a sudden or sharp braking event; 4) Correct seating of the brake operator in the pilotÂs seat during tow to be able to apply brakes in an effective and timely manner in the event of tow bar detachment. In addition, the lack of training on aircraft operating procedures and emergency evacuation procedures given to the tow crew jeopardized the safe securing of the aircraft and safe evacuation after the accident. In conclusion, the cause of the accident was identified to be: - A lack of training, clear procedures and inadequate level of attention given to safety during operation.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BAAI Report number: BAAI/ACR-002-2021 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: timesofmalta.com  https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/9h-qcj   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot and 4 passengers were not injured.  The pilot reported that, he had brushed off the snow on the airplane before refueling the airplane. The passengers then boarded the airplane, and he readied the airplane for departure. During the takeoff roll, the engine gauges were in the green and everything seemed normal. During climb out, he began to retract the flaps, and while raising the last 10Â°, the engine began to run rough. The pilot elected to abort the landing, and reduced engine power and lowered the nose toward the runway. The airplane subsequently landed hard, bounced, and came to a stop off the runway. The left main landing gear was damaged along with the left side fuselage, which sustained substantial damage.  The passengers stated that after the airplane lifted off the runway, the engine sputtered, and then the airplane touched back down on the runway. It bounced 3 or 4 times before it came to a stop. Postaccident examination of the engine, which included an engine run by the operator, revealed no evidence of any preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. A fuel sample was tested, with no discrepancies noted. Ground witnesses reported heavy snowfall and a buildup of snow on the airplane. Witnesses further reported that there were no wing covers on the wings. They also reported that the pilot had brushed off an accumulation of snow before departing.

According to the first officer, who was initially the flying pilot, they departed from Centennial Airport (APA) for a short positioning flight to Colorado Springs (COS). After departure, air traffic control provided vectors to intercept the GPS approach for 17R at COS. The crew intercepted the approach at the initial approach fix and descended as required to meet the mandatory crossing altitudes. The airplane exited the overcast cloud layer at an altitude of 650- 700 ft above ground level and the first officer had COS in sight. It was at this time that the first officer reported he realized that visually, the flight path was offset about 0,5 mile right of the runway centerline.   The captain requested control of the airplane and then made the required course correction to line up with the centerline of the runway. This correction occurred about 1,5 - 2 miles from the runway threshold. About 100 ft above the ground, the captain reduced the throttles to ""idle"", was able to establish runway centerline, and continued the descent for landing.  As the airplane descended through 10-20 ft above the runway, the captain reported that the ""stick shaker"" activated. The first officer was monitoring and announced ""stall,"" and the captain advanced both throttles. Just before the airplane touched down, it experienced an uncommanded roll to the right and the nose dropped. The captain attempted to arrest the roll by applying left aileron, but the airplane did not respond in time and the right tip tanking struck the runway surface just before the landing gear contacted the runway. The crew was able to maintain control throughout the rollout and the airplane continued to taxi and exit the runway under its own power. The airplane received substantial damage to the right wing. Probable Cause: The flight crewÂs improper decision to continue the unstabilized approach, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall and impact with the runway during landing.METAR: 15:54 UTC /  local time: SPECI KCOS 151641Z 14019KT 6SM BR OVC005 02/01 A2995 RMK AO2 DZE40 METAR KCOS 151554Z 23004KT 3SM -DZ BR OVC003 01/M01 A2998Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN21LA190 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot reported to the NTSB that, during final approach to land, he noticed a road grader operating on the far end of the runway. He made a radio transmission stating that the flight was 4 miles out on final approach and observed the road grader pull over at the opposite end of the airport and park. Believing that the operator of the road grader heard his call and parked, he proceeded with a normal approach and landing. After touchdown, he applied reverse with moderate braking. When the airplane was fully out of reverse and had slowed to about 35 mph, he noticed a large piece of foreign object debris (FOD) on the runway centerline. The FOD appeared to be about 18 inches wide and about 12 inches tall. He veered to the left in an effort to straddle the FOD with main landing gear. Subsequently, the right main landing gear struck the FOD, the right main landing gear collapsed, and the airplane slid about 75 ft down the runway centerline before coming to a stop. A postaccident inspection revealed that the FOD was a chunk of ice. Probable Cause: The pilotÂs failure to visually inspect the runway condition before landing, which resulted in a collision with an ice chunk and main landing gear separation during landing.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ANC21LA030 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: adn.com  sfchronicle.com   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot, copilot, and passengers described that the pilot descended to a lower altitude and flew along a riverbed, at times at an altitude that was below the surrounding trees and terrain. The pilot stated that he next planned on doing a touch-and-go landing on the river to entertain the passengers. One of the passengers said that while flying along the river, the pilots were concerned about hitting powerlines and had to maneuver to prevent hitting them and a bridge. Shortly after, as the pilots were following a sharp bend in the river while looking for a place to conduct a touch-and-go landing, the airplane's right wing stuck a power line. The airplane's right wing and aileron were substantially damaged, though the damage did not prohibit the airplane from being able to fly, and the pilot characterized that the airplane felt out of trim and 'a little heavier on one side.'Â The flight continued towards their destination and a subsequent conversation ensued between the pilot and the passengers, asking if the meeting could be missed, and if they should return to their departure airport, about 45 minutes away. The decision was made to return to the departure airport where the airplane landed without further incident. The pilot elected not to perform a precautionary landing at a nearby airport nor declare an emergency because the airplane appeared to be performing well.  The operator stated there were no mechanical deficiencies with the airplane that contributed to the accident. Further, the operator did not have any guidance or policies relating to low-altitude maneuvering with passengers onboard. Probable Cause: The pilot's improper decision to conduct a low altitude flight and his failure to see and avoid powerlines. Contributing was the operator's lack of safety guidance or a safety policy for low-altitude operations.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA21LA193 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  4 September 2024 N143CA Haugland Group Aviation LLC 0 East River, NY sub Wingtip, pod strike Location  Images: photo (c) FAA; 26 April 2021 photo (c) FAA; 26 April 2021 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates09-Sep-2024 16:18 ASN Updated [Source, Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All three occupants were injured. Approaching the joint military and civilian airport at Gwalior the crew were advised by ATC that runway 24L was in use. ATC then asked the crew if they would like to carry out a VOR approach for the opposite runway 06R. The crew requested for a night visual approach for runway 06R and were cleared to descend 2700 ft. After reporting that they had the airport in sight, the crew were cleared to circuit altitude. The first officer called turning right base with field visual and the flight was cleared to land which the crew acknowledged. Just before landing the aircraft and short of the threshold, the main gear collided with the raised arrester barrier and came to a halt on the runway 06R just beyond the threshold markings. Since Gwalior is a joint military/civil airport, the barrier nets were used to prevent military jets from overrunning runway 24L and were inadvertently left in a raised position. Probable cause of the Accident: 1) The PIC (PF) carrying out a visual approach at night and knowingly deviated below the visual approach path profile (3 degrees) while disregarding the PAPI indications, thereby the aircraft collided with the raised Arrester Barrier. 2) Lack of Assertiveness on the part of the Co-pilot (PM). Contributory Factors: 1) Non-Compliance to the SOP of ""Change of Runway Checklist"" by the ATC staff leading to the ""Arrester Barrier"" remaining in a ""Raised Position"" while the aircraft (VT-MPQ) came in for landing on runway 06R. 2) Non-essential conversation by the flight crew during the final approach for landing causing distraction leading to a delayed sighting of the raised Arrester Barrier. 3) Systemic failure at various levels at the Gwalior Air Force Base to ensure that the ""Arrester Barrier Position Indicator Lights and Integral Panel Lights"" were not rectified in a stipulated time period. 4) A robust alternate procedure was not defined when the ""Arrester Barrier Position Indicator Lights and Integral Panel Lights"" were unserviceable. 5) The Gwalior Airforce Base authorities did not install ""Red Obstacle Lights"" on the Arrester Barrier Poles to indicate the position of the obstacle on the date of the accident as per the DGCA requirements (CAR Section 4, Series B, Part 1).Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB India Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: timesofindia.indiatimes.com  ndtv.com   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The copilot was Pilot Flying. The flight was cleared for an RNP approach to runway 21. At 10:05 the aircraft was at 958 feet and passed the minimum descent height. The flight reported runway in sight and continued the approach.  At a distance of 1.5 nm from the runway threshold, the aircraft dropped below the glide slope.  At 10:06:14, at about 0.15 nm from the runway, the pilot called ""come and go around"", and two seconds later, the autopilot was disconnected. Four seconds later the main landing gear and tail skid struck the top of a concrete perimeter wall The flight crew continued the missed approach procedure and radioed that they suspected damage to the nose landing gear. At 10:08, the flight crew requested to return to Songshan Airport. Suspecting damage to the nose gear, the flight crew first flew a low pass over runway 10  at 10:45 hours. The tower controller at Songshan Airport reported observing damage to the right main gear wheels. The pilot decided to fly the traffic circuit with the gear down and landed on runway 10 at 11:07 hours. The aircraft and the runway surface were damaged but there were no injuries. Findings Related to Probable Cause: When the occurrence aircraft performed a non-precision approach to runway 21 of Nangan Airport, the pre-threshold area was obscured by low clouds or marine fog. During the final approach, the pilot flying used the autopilot lateral navigation and vertical speed mode for the approach. Focusing on flight operations in the cockpit, the pilot flying lost situational awareness of the aircraft position and did not realize that the aircraft altitude was very close to the runway threshold elevation. When the aircraft entered low clouds and was unable to maintain visual contact with the runway, the pilot flying did not follow the procedure of immediate execution of a go-around but continued using the autopilot for the approach, the pilot monitoring did not remind the pilot flying to execute or call for a go-around. When the pilot flying decided to perform a go-around, the aircraft had reached an altitude of 229 ft, 11 ft above the runway threshold elevation. Because the altitude was too low, before the aircraft could establish an effective positive rate of climb, the aircraftÂs main wheels and tail skid collided with the top outer edge of the pre-threshold area of runway 21, causing substantial damage to the aircraft.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TTSB Report number: TTSB-FRP-21-09-001 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: TTSB   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

At approximately 23:30 h, the passengers began to disembark via the aircraftâs forward stairs. While disembarking, one of the passengers got one of the two suitcases he was carrying caught on the stairs and lost his balance. Being unable to grab the handrail, he fell from the top of the stairs and hit another passenger at the bottom of the stairs. The passenger who fell sustained serious injuries. The crew stopped the disembarkation via the forward stairs and redirected the rest of the passengers towards the rear exit of the aircraft. The ground personnel immediately assisted the injured passenger, and the dispatcher called for an ambulance, which took approximately 10 minutes to arrive and transferred the wounded passenger to hospital. At the hospital, the injured passenger received stitches to his head, and it was confirmed that he had broken his arm. The investigation has determined that the cause of the accident was the passengerâs decision to disregard the disembarkation instructions and descend the stairs with one suitcase in each hand. The stairs are approximately 0.62 m2 wide, which is sufficient for passengers to carry a single suitcase. However, as was shown in this case, it may not be enough to carry two suitcases, especially if they are separated a certain distance from the body. Moreover, anyone carrying two suitcases would be unable to grasp the handrail should they lose their balance.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIAIAC Report number: A-020/2021 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: CIAIAC Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

The Cirrus departed Denver-Centennial Airport (APA) for a local flight about 09:21, and the Metro II departed the Salida Airport (SLT) about 09:56. The Cirrus was performing a right-hand traffic pattern for runway 17R at APA, and N280KL was on final approach for runway 17L at APA, when the collision occurred. Both airplanes were in communication with air traffic control during their respective approaches to the airport. About 10:22:43, the Metro II was about 5.5 nm from APA and had completed a right turn to align with the final approach course to runway 17L. At this same time, the Cirrus was on the downwind leg of the right-hand traffic pattern for runway 17R just before he commenced a right turn to the base leg of the traffic pattern. The Metro continued its approach and remained aligned with runway 17L. The Cirrus continued the right-hand traffic pattern through the base leg, and then began to turn toward the final approach course for the runway. The airplanes collided at 10:23:53 when they were about 3.2 nm from APA. The Metro was aligned with runway 17L while the Cirrus was turning from base to final and heading about 146Â° when the collision occurred. After the impact, N280KL declared an emergency, continued to APA, and landed successfully on runway 17L without further incident. The Cirrus pilot reported that the airplane was not controllable after the impact and he deployed the Cirrus Airframe Parachute System (CAPS). The aircraft came to rest about 3 nm north of APA. Probable Cause and Findings: The Cirrus pilotÂs failure to maintain the final approach course for the assigned runway, which resulted in a collision with the Swearingen which was on final approach to the parallel runway. Contributing to the accident was the failure of the controller to issue a traffic advisory to the Swearingen pilot regarding the location of Cirrus, and the Cirrus pilotÂs decision to fly higher than recommended approach speed which resulted in a larger turn radius and contributed to his overshoot of the final approach course.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN21FA215A Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  9 March 1982 N323BA Britt Airways 0 South Bend, IN min 11 December 1986 N323BA Britt Airways 0 Paducah, KY min Location  Images: photo (c) L1011TRISTAR; Denver-Centennial Airport, CO (APA/KAPA); 12 May 2021 photo (c) NTSB; Denver-Centennial Airport, CO (APA/KAPA); 12 May 2021 photo (c) NTSB; Denver-Centennial Airport, CO (APA/KAPA); 12 May 2021 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

According to the flight crew, this was the captainÂs first flight of the month after being on vacation, and it was the first officerÂs (FO) first day back flying since September 2020 due to furlough. The flight crew indicated that prior to pushback, they had setup the airplane for a south departure from DFW. However, after being pushed back, they completed the After Start Checklist and then noticed that the other traffic was departing to the north. After confirming this by tuning in the Automated Terminal Information System (ATIS), they updated their departure clearance before calling the ramp for taxi clearance. The captain stated that the airplane must have veered left of centerline as he and the FOÂs attention was focused inside the cockpit as they were reconfiguring the instruments. The captain indicated that the left wing struck a light pole, as he was adjusting the course and heading knobs. The captain stopped the airplane, called ground control, and the airplane was subsequently towed back to the gate. Post-flight inspection revealed substantial damage to the left wing, including damage to the number 1 leading edge slat, wing skin, front spar, and track ribs.

The pilot stated that, on final approach, he lowered the landing gear, placed the propeller controls forward, confirmed that the landing gear position indicator lights illuminated green, and completed the before landing checklist. He stated that he felt the drag associated with the gear being extended, but the airplane was not slowing as much as usual. As the airplane crossed the runway threshold, the pilot heard radio transmissions from the controller and another airplane to check the landing gear configuration, and he stated that he saw three green lights. He reported that the landing was smooth and felt normal; however, the airplane settled onto the runway and within a few seconds, the propellers impacted the ground. Airport surveillance video indicated that the airplane's landing gear remained fully retracted during the approach and over the runway just before touchdown. Postaccident examination of the landing gear and landing gear indicating/warning system revealed no anomalies that would have precludedÂ normal operation. The circumstances of the accident are consistent with the pilot's failure to properly configure the landing gear before landing.

After the airplane touched down on the runway, he applied the brakes, however, there was no braking action from the airplane and the pilot reported that there was no compression of the brake pedals. The pilot called out that they had ""no brakes"" and elected to pull the emergency brake. The airplane began to skid, the pilot released the emergency brake, and noted that the airplane was about 45Â° off centerline and continued to turn to the left. The airplane struck the grass apron next to the runway, completed a 180Â° turn, and came to rest the opposite direction of travel in the grass to the left side of the runway. Examination of the wreckage by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed that the right main landing gear collapsed, which resulted in substantial damage to the right wing. Furthermore, the left main landing gear tire was located about 225 ft from the main wreckage. Examination of the airplane discrepancy log revealed that the left main landing gear tire was replaced the morning of the accident due to a discrepancy the pilot wrote up the day before the accident, which stated the left main landing gear tire was Âworn beyond [the] thread cords.Â  The same aircraft was involved in an incident back in 2018 at DeKalb-Peachtree Airport (KPDK).

Two passengers onboard received serious injuries and 2 passengers received minor injuries. The aircraft took off from Mumbai and the flight was uneventful throughout climb and cruise phase. Kolkata ATIS issued weather warning of TSRA and gusty winds at the time of arrival of the aircraft at Kolkata. The PF made a PA informing passenger about the expected turbulent weather during descent and advised to keep the seat belt fastened. PF also informed the SCC to secure the cabin. The aircraft was on the right of the assigned track as there were CBâs & Line squalls along the route and also to the left hand side of the route. Further to this deviation, there were similar line squalls and thunderstorms. As per the flight crew, during descent at FL390, they identified a 20 NM gap between two CBâs and decided to fly through it. While passing through the gap aircraft started experiencing light to moderate turbulence. This moderate turbulence lasted for 10-15 seconds and ended with a huge bump of severe turbulence, which lasted for 1-2 seconds.  Probable Cause of the Accident The accident occurred as the aircraft entered into a severe turbulence instead of circumnavigating it. This resulted in serious injuries to passengers who presumably did not comply withâ fasten seat beltâ sign and instructions given by cabin crew. Contributory factors to the accident were: - â¢ The flight crew was well aware about the deteriorating weather at and around Kolkata. Notwithstanding this, they continued the flight in severe weather conditions. â¢ Operatorâs Operations Manual does not provide clear cut guidance to flight crew regarding circumnavigation through the enroute bad weather (weather avoidance). â¢ At any point during the flight, the flight crew did not consider diverting to an alternate airfield even though they were not sure whether the gap is clear of any clouds. â¢ Flight Dispatch did not provide any guidance to flight crew, while they were negotiating enroute weather which was not in line with the company Flight Dispatch Manual. â¢ As the aircraft was approaching the identified gap, PIC instructed cabin crew to be seated due to which the process of seatbelt compliance and securing the cabin could not be completed.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB India Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: https://indianexpress.com/article/india/vistara-mumbai-kolkata-flight-passengers-7348273/  https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/vt-tge#27f72d6e  Video : http://www.goklerdeyiz.net/yolcu-ucagi-turbulansa-yakalandi-8-yolcu-yaralandi/  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates07-Jun-2021 19:57 Goklerdeyiz.net Added 07-Jun-2021 19:59 harro Updated [Time, Aircraft type, Total fatalities, Total occupants, Other fatalities, Location, Source, Narrative, ]07-Apr-2022 09:21 harro Updated [Total occupants, Damage, Narrative, Accident report, ]16-Jun-2024 16:53 ASN Updated [Narrative, ]17-Jun-2024 15:48 ASN Updated [Category, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The captain of the flight was Pilot Flying, the copilot was Pilot Monitoring. During approach to Hubli, the aircraft was cleared to land on runway 26. The aircraft touched down on the runway and bounced four times. All four touchdowns were hard, the first was a three point landing and on the subsequent three landings, the nose landing gear touched the runway first. After the fourth touchdown the crew initiated a go-around. During the go-around, the landing gear unsafe warning was displayed 20 seconds. However, this went unnoticed by the crew. Subsequently, when the landing gears were selected up, the landing gear unsafe indication cleared automatically. Thereafter, the aircraft climbed as per instructions of ATC Hubli and entered a holding pattern. During the second approach to the same runway 26, when the landing gears were selected down, the landing gear unsafe warning was displayed again, which was noticed by the crew. As there were three green indications on the primary display and one red indication for the nose landing gear on on the overhead panel, the crew disregarded the unsafe indication as per QRH procedure. Checklists were carried out and the landing phase was initiated. After second approach, the aircraft again touched down on runway 26 and bounced consecutively three times, before coming to rest on the runway after the fourth touchdown. Probable Cause: The probable cause of this accident is attributed to inappropriate aircraft landing technique and not following the bounced landing recovery procedure i.e., delayed flare, high speed at touchdown and delay in initiating a ""Go-Around"". Contributory factors for this accident were lack of situational awareness and lack of commitment to initiate a ""Go-Around"" after experiencing a significant bounce.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB India Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft was on stand being prepared for a cargo flight to Frankfurt (BA906). A ground maintenance team was working to address three fault messages associated with the Nose Landing Gear (NLG) doors while the flight crew prepared the aircraft for the flight. The Dispatch Deviation Guide confirmed that rectification of the defects could be deferred to a later date providing the landing gear was recycled to confirm the NLG doors functioned correctly. To prevent the landing gear from retracting when up was selected, the landing gear downlock pins were fitted. However, when the lead engineer selected the landing gear lever to up, the NLG retracted. The aircraftÂs nose struck the ground causing significant damage to the lower front section of the aircraft and inflicting minor injuries on the co-pilot and one of the cargo loading team. The NLG downlock pin had inadvertently been inserted in the downlock link assembly apex pin bore instead of the downlock pin hole. The design of the aircraft nose landing gear downlock assembly created an opportunity for error when inserting the NLG locking pin, with two holes located so close together that the pin could be inadvertently inserted in the incorrect location. A Service Bulletin and Airworthiness Directive was available that would have prevented the accident, but this had not yet been completed on G-ZBJB. AAIB Conclusions: The aircraft NLG retracted on the ground when the landing gear selection lever was selected to up as part of a maintenance procedure. The NLG downlock pin had inadvertently been inserted in the downlock link assembly apex pin bore instead of the downlock pin hole.  When the nose of the aircraft struck the ground, significant damage was caused to the lower front section of the aircraft and minor injuries to the co-pilot and a member of the cargo load team. The design of the aircraft nose landing gear downlock assembly created an opportunity for error when inserting the NLG locking pin, with two holes located so close together that the pin could be inadvertently inserted in the incorrect location. There were powerful auditory and tactile cues that could easily mislead someone to believe the pin was correctly inserted even when it wasnÂt and there were no strong visual indications to distinguish between the correct and incorrect placements. The determination of the risk of incorrect installation of the NLG downlock pin in the manufacturerÂs SB and the regulatorÂs AD did take account of the design of the B787 NLG and the associated probability for error. The operatorÂs process to embody ADs and SBs considered flight safety, airworthiness and the ADÂs ÂeffectÂ in enhancing safety, but there was no documented evidence that health and safety risks had been fully considered. Had these risks, that were clearly highlighted in the AD and SB, been given greater significance by the operator during the embodiment process, the priority of the modification may have been escalated and avoided the decision to defer implementation to the end of the compliance period.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: AAIB-27411 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: AAIB   Location  Images: photo (c) AAIB; London Heathrow Airport (LHR); 18 June 2021 photo (c) AAIB; London Heathrow Airport (LHR); 18 June 2021 photo (c) AAIB; London Heathrow Airport (LHR) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The right-hand main gear collapsed. The pilot was planning to conduct an aerial application flight on a rice field. It appeared that the pilots licence of the captain had expired in 2010. The accident with the An-2 RA-01430 aircraft occurred during takeoff from a landing strip with a non-uniform surface, which led to the aircraft yawing during the takeoff run. Correcting the directional sway, the PIC allowed a sharp operation of the brakes and wheels, which, in turn, led to an uncontrolled turn to the left, as a result of which the aircraft rolled out of the landing area and collided with a bunker. The contributing factors were most likely: - the PIC's interruptions in flight work and, as a consequence, the loss of flight skills in aircraft piloting; - failure to comply with the operator's RPM requirements in terms of training flight personnel on the An-2 aircraft; - lack of a tail wheel locking mechanism on the An-2 RA-01430 aircraft; - takeoff using the rated engine power with the flaps extended to the 20Â° position, which does not correspond to the Airplane Flight Manual of the An-2 aircraft, when taking off from a site with a non-uniform surface (take off at the engine takeoff power with the flaps deflected by 30Â°).Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The captain was the pilot flying (PF) and the first officer was monitoring. Ride conditions were smooth with no reports of turbulence in the area and the crewmembers had the weather radar turned off. The flight was in day visual meteorological conditions (VMC) with the visibility greater than 20 miles.  About 20 miles NW of the REDFN waypoint, near airway Q105, the flight experienced a single 'joltÃ¢â¬Â of severe turbulence, which caused the autopilot to disconnect, and the airplane to roll about 30 degrees to the right and climb about 300 feet. The PF took control and returned the airplane to its assigned altitude and reengaged the autopilot.  When the turbulence occurred beverage service had recently concluded, and two flight attendants were in the aisle collecting trash. One flight attendant was in the aft galley securing service items and was thrown to the ceiling and fell, fracturing his left ankle. Ten passengers who were not seated or who were not using their seatbelts sustained minor injuries. The fasten seatbelt indication to passengers was turned off.

The pilot performed a forced landing in a field 2 km west of Teuge Airport next to the A50 motorway.  The right wing impacted a billboard and the aircraft swung while coming to a stop against a crash barrier next to the highway. On the morning of the accident, the aircraft was parked inside the hangar of a maintenance organisation for a maintenance task before the planned flights that day. When the aircraft was on ground with the engine off, erratic and high engine Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT) readings were reported. The maintenance organisation suspected a faulty magnetic pick-up in the engineÂs propeller governor to be the cause of these erratic EGT readings. A mechanic under supervision of a licenced engineer was tasked to replace the magnetic pick-up. After removal of the old magnetic pick-up, the mechanic followed steps one through four of the maintenance manual to install the new magnetic pick-up. Steps five through eight, a system voltage test to check correct installation, were not noticed by the mechanic and as a result not carried out. After connecting the wiring and tightening the lock nut, the mechanic, together with the pilot, did a static engine test run and performed the Single Red Line (SRL) check to verify the system and EGT readings. After the system was found to be functioning correctly, the mechanic left the aircraft and the pilot taxied to the skydive organisationÂs building to pick up parachutists. Following the boarding of seventeen parachutists, the pilot taxied to runway 26 and commenced the takeoff roll. Shortly after takeoff, without any warning, the engine lost power at approximately 400 feet above field level. The pilot made an emergency landing in a field whereby the aircraft sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, wings, landing gear and propeller. One parachutist suffered minor injuries. CONCLUSIONS:  During the initial climb after takeoff, the aircraft suffered a complete loss of engine power as a result of the uncommanded feathering of the propeller. This feathering was the result of damage that occurred within the propeller governor. Most probably, the incorrect installation of the magnetic pick-up in the propeller governor prior to the accident flight led to contact damage between the pick-up and the rotating toothed gear. Debris restricted the free movement of the ball head assembly in the governor housing, allowing all oil to drain from the propeller dome and causing the propeller to continuously move to the feather position and eventually cease rotation. The increasing pitch of the propeller led to a power reduction of the engine which reinforced itself. The distorted output signal of the damaged magnetic pick-up did not cause the engine flame out. The design of the propeller governorÂs toothed gear makes it possible to position the magnetic pick-up in between its teeth. The maintenance procedure for the replacement of the magnetic pick-up did not specifically mention or address this. The final steps of this procedure, a voltage check to verify the correct placement of the pick-up, were not performed by the maintenance staff. The design of the toothed gear in combination with the procedure in the maintenance manual allowed for the incorrect installation.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Dutch Safety Board Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: http://airdatasearch.com/reg/PH-FST  omroepgelderland.nl   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The distribution of persons with reduced mobility on board the aeroplane, between the different specialist vehicles upon arrival was not shared with the crew prior to the landing and the matter was only addressed after the other passengers had disembarked. The cabin crew then had to manage an unplanned situation involving a number of passengers wanting to board a specialist vehicle beyond the vehicle?s capacity, when all of the aeroplane?s occupants were fatigued from the flight.A PRM and her travel companion did not want to be separated and chose to use the disembarkation steps to stay together. The heavy workload associated with the confused situation, as well as the behaviour (described as aggressive) of the travel companion, prevented the crew members, the arrival agent and the assistance personnel from spotting in time that the passenger was descending the steps alone and unaided. She subsequently tripped during her descent and fell to the bottom of the steps.The emergency services were alerted in compliance with the procedures in force. The public emergency services took longer to arrive than the average response time for this type of intervention at Paris-Charles de Gaulle. The crew members considered the response time to be too long, likely due to the perceived severity of the medical emergency and to their knowledge of the usually very quick response times of the ARFF in the aeronautical domain.Due to the lack of updates on the expected arrival time of the emergency services, the captain decided to issue a MAYDAY to put an end to his uncertainty. This alert, which was issued several minutes before the arrival of the emergency services mobilised first, led to the subsequent mobilisation of substantial fire fighting resources.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: https://bea.aero/en/investigation-reports/notified-events/detail/accident-to-the-airbus-a350-registered-f-htyh-operated-by-air-france-on-29-06-2021-at-paris-charles-de-gaulle/ History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  21 January 2024 F-HTYH Air France 0 TorontoâLester B.

Inouye International Airport, HI (HNL/PHNL)","Kahului Airport, HI (OGG/PHOG)","Accident investigation report completed and information captured","Transair flight 810, a Boeing 737-200C cargo plane, ditched in Mamala Bay off Honolulu, Hawaii, after experiencing an engine anomaly after takeoff. The captain sustained serious injuries, the first officer sustained minor injuries, and the  airplane was destroyed. The aircraft took off from runway 08R at Honolulu-Daniel K. Inouye International Airport at 01:33 hours local time on a cargo flight to Kahului International Airport (OGG). As the aircraft climbed to an altitude of about 390 feet, at an airspeed of 155 knots, the EPR of the right engine dropoped to 1.43 for a period of two seconds. The aircraft then began to yaw to the right. The co-pilot corrected the tendency by using the left rudder. He stated that engine number 2 (right) had failed, which was confirmed by the captain. Upon reaching 2000 feet, the first officer (who was Pilot Flying) selected flight idle thrust. In the meantime the captain radioed Honolulu Tower that they had an emergency  The captain then instructed the co-pilot to maintain a speed of 220 knots, an altitude of 2000 feet and a heading of 240Â°. This heading the controller had given to Transair 809 on the same radio frequency about 52 seconds before. About 3 minutes and 14 seconds after the loss of power in the right engine, the captain took control of the aircraft; at that time the aircraft's speed was 224 knots and the heading was 242Â°. By then, the altitude of the aircraft had dropped from about 2100 feet to 1690 feet.  The captain pulled the nose up slightly, allowing the aircraft to climb to 1878 feet, but at the expense of airspeed, which dropped to 196 knots. Although it was determined immediately after takeoff that the right engine had failed, the crew again tried to establish the failing engine. The co-pilot then noted that the left engine had failed. The captain accepted the copilot's assessment and took no action to verify the information.  He moved the throttle of the right engine forward. The co-pilot then asked the captain if they should ""go back to the airport"" before the plane would be ""too far away."" The captain replied that the plane would stay within 15 miles of the airport. This would not interfere with other traffic and give them time to address the engine problem.  He then instructed the co-pilot to run the engine failure checklist.  While working checklist, the co-pilot noticed that the right engine's exhaust temperature (EGT) was in the red. He indicated that the power on the right engine should be reduced. The captain then decided that they  should return to the airport. Since they can no longer see the airport, Honolulu Tower issued heading instructions. Meanwhile the EGT remains deep in the red. The captain instructed the co-pilot to proceed with the engine failure checklist. But moments later, the co-pilot stopped again and stated, ""this engine is no good, we need to shut it down."" The captain agreed and ordered the right engine to be shut down.  The captain then began to steer the back toward the airport. The altitude was then only 320 feet at a speed of 180 knots. About 27 seconds before the crash, the left EPR was increased to 1.62, and the airspeed dropped to 156 knots. The captain then increased power on the left engine to maximum continuous power (1.95 EPR), but the aircraft hit the water, eleven and a half minutes after takeoff, 5.5 miles southwest of Honolulu Airport. Both pilots were able to escape from the sinking plane. The Coast Guard was alerted and an MH-65 Dolphin helicopter was on scene around 02:30. The captain was hanging from the floating tail section of the plane and the co-pilot was lying on top of floating wreckage. The captain was lifted from the water to the helicopter with the help of a rescue diver. The diver then re-entered the water and swam with the co-pilot to the rescue boat, which arrived at the scene around 02:40. The wreckage sank to a depth of about 105 meters and was salvaged in Octobter 2021. The subsequent investigation shows that two high-pressure turbine blades (Nos. 1 and 6) of the right engine had fractured. They failed by stress rupture resulting from a loss of loadbearing material due to oxidation and corrosion. Probable Cause and Findings: The flight crewmembersÂ misidentification of the damaged engine (after leveling off the airplane and reducing thrust) and their use of only the damaged engine for thrust during the remainder of the flight, resulting in an unintentional descent and forced ditching in the Pacific Ocean. Contributing to the accident were the flight crewÂs ineffective crew resource management, high workload, and stress.METAR: 10:53 UTC / 00:53 local time: PHNL 021053Z 07013KT 10SM FEW025 SCT045 26/18 A3004 RMK AO2 SLP170 T0256018311:53 UTC / 01:53 local time: PHNL 021153Z 06010G21KT 10SM FEW025 SCT050 26/17 A3003 RMK AO2 SLP169 60000 T02560172 10267 20256 56008Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA21FA174 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: cnbc.com   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; off Honolulu-Daniel K.

Of the 181 passengers and crew onboard, one flight attendant was seriously injured. The airplane was not damaged. The regularly scheduled passenger flight was operating under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 from the Dallas-Fort Worth International airport (KDFW), Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, to KMIA.    According to the flight crew, they observed convective activity that they would descend through during the approach and informed the lead flight attendant to prepare the cabin early and to take their seats. The weather radar was on, and the seatbelt sign was illuminated.  Shortly after this, as they descended through between 12,000-10,000 feet, the airplane passed through the tops of a small cumulus buildup and the flight experienced moderate turbulence.  When the turbulence was encountered, the #3 flight attendant (FA), located in the aft galley, was thrown into the air and was seriously injured after striking the floor hard.  The FAs informed the flight crew of the injury and the captain requested paramedics meet the flight at the gate.  After landing, the flight attendant was transported to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a fractured compressed vertebra. Probable Cause: an inadvertent encounter with convective turbulence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA21LA176 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA21LA176  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates02-Jun-2022 19:28 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

It went down a dropoff. The aircraft was operating an ambulance flight to pick up a Covid-19 patient. Diamantina Airport has a single asphalt runway (03/21), measuring 1610 x 30 m. Past the paved runway surface of runway 03 there is a 60 m stopway, followed by downsloping terrain. Contributing factors: - Application of controls - contributed. Considering that the distance ahead of the aircraft at the moment of touchdown (600 m) was not sufficient to decelerate and stop the plane within the runway limits, it was found that an inadequacy in the use of flight controls led to a long landing, where, from the touchdown point, there was not enough runway to safely stop the aircraft. - Attitude - undetermined. The fact that the PIC (PM) had already conducted several flights with the SIC (PF) without any issues, as well as their close relationship, may have contributed to an attitude of excessive confidence and resulted in a non-assertive perception of the approach parameters during this phase of the flight. - Cockpit coordination - contributed. The account of the events leading up to the landing indicated that the available human resources for aircraft operation were not adequately utilized, as the PIC (PM) only noticed the deviations that led to this runway excursion on short final, characterizing inefficient cockpit coordination as a contributing factor to the studied accident. - Fatigue - undetermined. Based on the medical examinations conducted after the accident, as well as the overall picture observed by the medical representative, it was inferred that the lack of response from the SIC (PF) to the PIC's (PM) alerts and impairment to his alertness could be indicative of the pilot experiencing fatigue-related effects that may have interfered with his performance. - Perception - contributed. The attempt to land even in the face of an unstable approach characterized an inadequate perception of the risks involved in continuing this procedure under the experienced conditions. - Pilot judgment - contributed. The decision to proceed with the landing, even after conducting an unstable approach to a position where only 600 m of runway would remain for the aircraft to stop, as well as the failure to consider the alternative of a go-around, characterized an inadequate judgment regarding the risks of the operation conducted under the circumstances.Accident investigation:   Report number: A-001/CENIPA/2021 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: g1.globo.com  itatiaia.com.br   Location  Images: photo (c) Corpo de Bombeiros Militar de Minas Gerais; Diamantina Airport, MG (DTI); 02 January 2021 photo (c) Corpo de Bombeiros Militar de Minas Gerais; Diamantina Airport, MG (DTI); 02 January 2021 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot was killed in the accident. The aircraft departed Troutdale Airport, Oregon at 22:08 UTC. After departure, while in contact with  Portland Approach and subsequently Seattle Center, the pilot had problems following the controllers' instructions with regards to  headings and radio frequency. The aircraft was cleared to climb to FL370 by Seattle Center and continued to climb, until 13:28:45, when it reached its highest altitude of 31,000 ft. The airplane began to descend, and remained for the next eight minutes in a spiraling and descending 1-mile radius right turn.

He had taken Citation 560 training toward the end of 2020 at a training facility in Arizona, however the owner of the facility stated that the pilot had not performed to a level sufficient to be issued a type rating or single pilot exemption.  During the training, he struggled significantly in high workload environments and had difficulty operating the airplaneÂs avionics suite, which had recently been installed. He revealed to a fellow pilot that he preferred to Âhand flyÂ the airplane rather than use the autopilot. Review of historical flight data, and statements provided by acquaintances of the pilot, indicate that this was likely the first time he had flown the airplane on his own.

The aircraft, a Boeing 737-500 registered PK-CLC, arrived at Jakarta-Soekarno-Hatta International Airport at 12:11 hours local time after a flight from Pangkal Pinang. The subsequent flight for the aircraft, SJ182, was due to depart at 13:40. Weather at the airport was poor with heavy rainfall and low clouds due to a thunderstorm in de vicinity. This caused a delay in departure. At 14:18 the aircraft was cleared to taxi to runway 25R. Take-off from runway 32R was commenced at 14:35 (07:35 UTC).  At 14:36:46, the pilot contacted the Terminal East (TE) controller and was cleared for an unrestricted climb to FL290. Five seconds later, at altitude of 1,980 feet, the Autopilot (AP) system engaged.

FDR data showed that the left engine N1 was decreasing whereas the right engine N1 remained the same. Nine seconds later flight requested a heading change to 075Â° to avoid weather conditions, which was approved by the TE controller. At 14:40:05, the aircraft reached the highest altitude of about 10,900 feet. The autopilot system disengaged at that point with a heading of 016Â°, the pitch angle was about 4.5Â° nose up, and the aircraft rolled to the left to more than 45Â°. The thrust lever position of the left engine continued decreasing while the right engine thrust lever remained in position. Five seconds later the the autothrottle (A/T) system disengaged and the pitch angle was more than 10Â° nose down. The aircraft had entered a high speed descent and impacted the surface of the sea about 20 seconds later. The wreckage was located and appeared to be distributed across an area of about 80 by 110 meters on the seabed at a depth of approximately 16 meters. The Indonesian NTSC reported on February 10 that the aircraft had a repeating issue the autothrottle in the days before the accident.  On 3 January 2021, a pilot reported that the autothrottle was unserviceable. An engineer rectified the problem by cleaning the autothrottle computerÂs electrical connector. After re-installation, the Built-in Test Equipment (BITE) test result was good.  On 4 January 2021, a pilot again reported that the autothrottle was unserviceable. An engineer tried cleaning the autothrottle computerÂs electrical connector but the problem remained and it was transferred to the Deferred Maintenance Items. On 5 January 2021, an engineer rectified the problem by cleaning the autothrottle Takeoff and Go Around (TOGA) switch and conducted a BITE test on the autothrottle computer. The BITE test result was good. Contributing Factors: - The corrective maintenance processes of the A/T problem were unable to identify the friction or binding within the mechanical system of the thrust lever and resulted in the prolonged and unresolved of the A/T problem. - The right thrust lever did not reduce when required by the A/P to obtain selected rate of climb and aircraft speed due to the friction or binding within the mechanical system, as a result, the left thrust lever compensated by moving further backward which resulted in thrust asymmetry. - The delayed CTSM activation to disengage the A/T system during the thrust asymmetry event due to the undervalued spoiler angle position input resulted in greater power asymmetry. - The automation complacency and confirmation bias might have led to a decrease in active monitoring which resulted in the thrust lever asymmetry and deviation of the flight path were not being monitored. - The aircraft rolled to the left instead of to the right as intended while the control wheel deflected to the right and inadequate monitoring of the EADI might have created assumption that the aircraft was rolling excessively to the right which resulted in an action that was contrary in restoring the aircraft to safe flight parameters. - The absence of the guidance of the national standard for the UPRT, may have contributed to the training program not being adequately implemented to ensure that pilots have enough knowledge to prevent and recover of an upset condition effectively and timely.METAR: 07:00 UTC / 14:00 local time: WIII 090700Z 30007KT 4000 VCTS RA FEW016CB OVC018 25/24 Q1007 NOSIG07:30 UTC / 14:30 local time: WIII 090730Z 30006KT 5000 -RA FEW017CB OVC018 25/24 Q1006 NOSIG08:00 UTC / 15:00 local time: WIII 090800Z 28008KT 4000 -RA BKN016 OVC018 26/24 Q1006 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSC Report number: KNKT.21.01.01.04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Antara  Flightradar24 track   Location  Images: photo (c) Leslie Snelleman; Balikpapan-Sepingan Airport (BPN/WALL); 09 November 2017 photo (c) M.

There were 64 people onboard: 2 flight crewmembers, 12 cabin crewmembers, and 50 passengers.  After entering Nicosia flight information region (LCCC FIR), Cyprus, during descent, the aircraft encountered moderate to severe air turbulence that lasted for approximately three minutes. The turbulence caused injuries to seven occupants.  The en route significant weather chart (SIGWX) contained in the operational flight plan (OFP) forecasted occasional isolated embedded cumulonimbus (CB) clouds affecting Nicosia FIR and Beirut FIR (OLBB). The OFP did not contain any significant meteorological information (SIGMET).  During the preflight briefing, the commander alerted the cabin crew about the possibility of in-flight turbulence during the descent to OLBA. On 17 January 2021, Larnaca International Airport (LCLK) meteorological watch office (MWO) issued several SIGMET of thunderstorms and severe turbulence affecting areas within LCCC FIR. The flight crew were not aware of the SIGMET issued by LCLK when the aircraft entered LCCC FIR.  With the aircraft at the top of descent (at FL360 within LCCC FIR), the commander, who was the pilot flying (PF), instructed the cabin crew to secure the cabin as he anticipated turbulence during descent and switched the seatbelt sign to ON. About three minutes into descent, at approximately 0804 UTC with the aircraft passing pressure altitude 29,200 ft, the aircraft started to encounter turbulence. The Copilot immediately made a passenger announcement for cabin crew to take their seats. Soon after, the aircraft encountered moderate to severe air turbulence. The flight crew believed the turbulence was âclear air turbulenceâ because there was no weather radar returns of precipitation displayed on the navigation display.  During the turbulence, the aircraft autopilot and autothrottle remained engaged and the aircraft remained inside its flight envelope. The turbulence-generated acceleration forces caused several unsecured cabin crewmembers and passengers to be forcefully lifted off their feet and impact cabin furnishings resulting in a serious injury to one passenger. There was no reported damage to the aircraft cabin.  The flight continued to the destination where the aircraft landed uneventfully. Causes The Air Accident Investigation Sector determines that the cause of the Accident was the significant vertical g-forces imposed on the Aircraft because of severe clear air turbulence, which caused an unsecured passenger to be forcefully lifted off her feet and impact cabin furnishings resulting in her right foot fracture serious injury. Contributory Factors (a) The influence of the jet stream and thunderstorm in the flight path area was significant enough to produce severe turbulence. (b) The flight crew decision making lacked critical information contained in SIGMET 3 issued by LCLK MWO (covering the period from 0530 to 0930) which forecasted severe turbulence between FL260 and FL390, south of latitude N3430. (c) The format of the SIGMET issued by LCLK MWO was different from the recommendations contained in ICAO Annex 3 and EU regulation No. 2020/469 such that the Weather Services International Fusion application (WSI Fusion) applied by the Operatorâs flight dispatch department did not generate a timely alert for SIGMET 3 report issued by LCLK MWO.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: GCAA Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: GCAA Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

The towing route followed the edge of the apron, which was damp and downhill, and involved a 90Â° left turn to line up for start. A combination of unfamiliarity with a relatively new operating base, towing in reverse and difficulty interpreting ""indistinct"" taxiway markings meant the tug driver entered the left turn later than intended. The late entry made the turn excessively tight, and the tug lost traction on the damp surface and jack-knifed. The resulting combination of a sharp towing angle and the aircraftÂs downhill momentum caused the towbar shear pin to break. The commander applied the brakes immediately on hearing ""the sound of snapping metal"" but was unable to prevent the aircraft rolling forward into the tug. The operatorÂs internal investigation report made several safety recommendations, including a review of towing procedures, enhanced driver training, the use of radios by towing teams and improvements to taxiway markings. The company also reviewed its apron risk assessment and towing was added to their audit plan. On 10 February 2021 the aircraft was ferried to Cranfield for repairs. On 1 July 2021 the aircraft was flown back to London-Biggin Hill Airport.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: AAIB-27100 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

During the cruise the crew independently calculated the landing performance. Runway 26 at Exeter Airport (EXT) was forecast to be wet, so they planned to use Flap 40 for the landing, with Autobrake 3. With both pilots being familiar with EXT the co-pilot, who was Pilot Flying (PF), conducted a short brief of the pertinent points for the approach.  From the ATIS they noted that the weather seemed to be better than forecast and the surface wind was from 230Â° at 11 kt. The ATC provided the flight crew with radar vectors from ATC to the ILS on Runway 26 at EXT. The landing gear was lowered and Flap 25 selected before the aircraft intercepted the glideslope. Flap 40 (the landing flap) was selected on the glideslope just below 2000 ft amsl. With a calculated VREF of 134 kt and a surface wind of 10 kt the PF planned to fly the approach with a VAPP of 140 kt. At about 10 nm finals, upon looking at the flight management computer, the captain, who was Pilot Monitoring (PM), noticed there was a 30 kt headwind, so a VAPP of 144 kt was selected on the Mode Control Panel (MCP). The crew became visual with the runway at about 1000 ft aal. The PF then disconnected the Auto Pilot and Auto Throttle; the Flight Directors remained on. As the wind was now starting to decrease, the VAPP was then reduced from 142 to 140 kt at about 600 ft aal. As the wind reduced, towards the 10 kt surface wind, the PF made small adjustments to the power to maintain the IAS at or close to VAPP. At 500 ft radio altimeter (RA) the approach was declared stable by the crew, as per their standard operating procedures. At this point the aircraft had a pitch attitude of 2.5Â° nose down, the IAS was 143 kt, the rate of descent (ROD) was about 860 ft/min, the engines were operating at about 68% N1 and the aircraft was 0.4 dots above the glideslope. However, the ROD was increasing and soon thereafter was in excess of 1,150 ft/min. This was reduced to about 300 ft/min but soon increased again. At 320 ft RA, the aircraft went below the glideslope for about 8 seconds and, with a ROD of 1,700 ft/min, a 'SINK RATE' GPWS alert was enunciated. The PF acknowledged this and corrected the flightpath to bring the aircraft back to the glideslope before stabilizing slightly above the glideslope; the PM called this deviation too. As the PF was correcting back to the glideslope the PM did not feel there was a need to take control. During this period the maximum recorded deviation was 3/4 of a dot below the glideslope. At about 150 ft RA, with a ROD of 1,300 ft/min, there was a further 'SINK RATE' GPWS alert, to which the PM said, 'watch that sink rate ', followed by another 'Sink Rate' alert, which the PF responded by saying 'and back...' The commander recalled that as the aircraft crossed the threshold, at about 100 ft, the PF retarded the throttles, pitched the aircraft nose down, from about 5Â° nose up to 4Â° nose down, and then applied some power in the last few feet. During these final moments before the landing, there was another 'Sink Rate' alert. The result was a hard landing. A 'Pull Up' warning was also triggered by the GPWS, but it was not audible on the CVR. The last surface wind transmitted by ATC, just before the landing, was from 230Â° at 10 kt. During the rollout the commander took control, selected the thrust reversers and slowed down to taxi speed. After the aircraft had vacated the runway at Taxiway Bravo it became apparent the aircraft was listing to the left. During the After Landing checks the co-pilot tried to select Flaps Up, but they would not move. There was then a Hydraulic LP caution. As there was still brake accumulator pressure the crew were content to taxi the aircraft slowly the short distance onto Stand 10. Once on stand the listing became more obvious. It was then that the crew realised there was something 'seriously wrong' with the aircraft. After they had shut the aircraft down, the flight crew requested that the wheels were chocked, and the aircraft be connected to ground power before going outside to inspect the aircraft. Once outside a hydraulic leak was found. The fuselage skin aft of the wings was cracked and buckled, and the rear fuselage was distorted downward. The crown skin was creased and rippled along most of the fuselage. Both main landing gear shock absorbers were found to be bottomed, and the left main landing gear beam was distorted upwards such that the aircraft was approximately 2Â° left-wing low. he flap drive mechanism was damaged, and the left-wing inboard driveshaft was bent; the left inboard gearbox casing and its mountings were broken. The maximum vertical acceleration recorded by the FDR on touchdown was 3.8g, at this point there was 3Â° of left roll. Conclusion: The aircraft suffered a hard landing as a result of the approach being continued after it became unstable after the aircraft had past the point where the crew had declared the approach stable and continued. Despite high rates of descent being observed beyond the stable point, together with associated alerts the crew elected to continue to land. Had the approach been discontinued and a GA flown, even at a low height, while the aircraft may have touched down the damage sustained may have been lessened. While the OM did not specifically state that an approach was to remain stable beyond the gate on the approach, the FCTM was specific that, if it did not remain stable, a GA should be initiated. The commander may have given the co-pilot the benefit of doubt and believed she had the ability to correct an approach that became unstable in the final few hundred feet of the approach. However, had there been any doubt, a GA should be executed.METAR: 02:20 UTC / 02:20 local time: EGTE 190220Z 23010KT 9000 -RA SCT012 BKN040 12/10 Q1009=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: AAIB-27092 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: AAIB   Location  Images: photo (c) AAIB; Exeter Airport (EXT); January 2021 photo (c) AAIB; Exeter Airport (EXT); January 2021 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The runway was temporally closed for inspection, but found nothing abnormal.  There were no injuries among two crew members.   PROBABLE CAUSES The JTSB concludes that the probable cause of this accident was that when the Aircraft made a go-around while becoming unstable attitude after touching down and bouncing, the pitch angle became excessively large with an inadequate aircraft speed, which more likely resulted in the lower aft fuselage contacting with the runway. The Aircraft bounced after the touchdown is because it was likely insufficient to deal with the crosswind. The pitch angle became excessively large with an inadequate aircraft speed is probably because the PIC reflexively moved the reverse thrust levers after the touchdown, therefore, in the situation where it took time for the aircraft speed to increase due to the go-around operation, while being anxious about the runway-remaining length and others and trying to get off the ground as quickly as possible, the PIC performed the nose-up operation without checking the aircraft speed.METAR: UTC /  local time: RJAA 011030Z 18009KT 9999 FEW025 10/05 Q1017 WS R16R NOSIG RMK 1CU025 A3003= UTC /  local time: RJAA 011000Z 21009KT 9999 FEW025 10/06 Q1017 NOSIG RMK 1CU025  A3005= UTC /  local time: RJAA 010930Z 16006KT 140V200 9999 FEW020 SCT130 09/06 Q1018  NOSIG RMK 1CU020 3AC130 A3006=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JTSB Report number: AA2023-5 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: JTSB History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  28 March 2018 JA13KZ Nippon Cargo Airlines 0 between Los Angeles and San Francisco min Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates11-Feb-2025 15:39 ASN Updated [Source, Narrative, Accident report, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

According to the flight crew, just prior to top of descent the captain informed the flight attendants to prepare the cabin early because there was weather in the vicinity of the arrival airport. Shortly after that, the first officer (FO), who was the pilot flying, initiated the descent.  Air traffic control then cleared the flight to a lower altitude and requested they increase their descent. The FO complied, and increased their vertical speed, however, at some point, he engaged ""open descent"" mode. The FO saw the airspeed increasing towards red line and he pulled back on the stick and the autopilot disengaged. The captain said he then took control using the autopilot disconnect/priority switch and applied aft stick pressure to return the airplane to a normal descent pitch attitude to prevent an overspeed. According to the flight crew, the airplane was in clear air and smooth flight conditions when the event occurred. Two flight attendants (FA) in the aft galley, were thrown into the air and onto the floor. The captain was notified that one of the FAs had been injured and would need assistance when they got to the gate. A deadheading FA assumed the injured FAs duties for the remainder of the flight.  After landing, the FA was transported to a local hospital and diagnosed with a fractured ankle.

It came down hard and the main gears and the nose gear broke. The plane slid on the runway and a fire broke out. The plane came to a stop to the left of the runway. Contributing factors: The three accidents discussed in the BEA final report have some similarities and highlight the difficulty for a crew to make an appropriate decision about using de-ice systems in icing conditions.  This decision is influenced by the high operational constraints due to the landing performance limitations in icing conditions on this type of plane. The extent of the landing performance penalties in icing conditions, compared to landing performance in non-icing conditions on this type of aircraft results in crews frequently encountering situations where the destination airport is accessible with comfortable safety margins in non -icing conditions but becomes inaccessible if the conditions are icing (i.e. total outside temperature below 5Â°C and visible moisture on approach, even in the absence of any signs of accretion on the aircraft). This may lead crews, both during flight planning and while carrying out the flight, to underestimate the risk of encountering icing conditions during the approach and landing in order to comply with the requested flight schedule or to avoid a diversion. Although compliance with the Flight Manual procedures is mandatory, the commercial pressures associated with this type of operation may encourage crews not to comply with the proper procedures for the approach and landing in icing conditions by deactivating the de-ice systems as soon as they visually observe that the leading edges of the wings are free of ice, and they consider that the risk of further contamination before landing is low. The statements gathered during the investigation suggest that this inadequate practice is common in the Phenom 100 pilot community. The following factors may have contributed to the crew not diverting and to them continuing the approach without the activation of the de-ice system: - The operator's choice to use an aeroplane type for flights to destinations where icing conditions on approach are not unlikely, although the performance of this aeroplane type is degraded in icing conditions and becomes incompatible with the runway landing distances available, even though these runway landing distances provide substantial margins in the absence of icing conditions. - The degraded landing performance of the Embraer EMB-500 Phenom 100 in icing conditions compared to performance in non-icing conditions. Crews thus frequently encounter situations where the destination airport is accessible with comfortable safety margins in non-icing conditions but becomes inaccessible in icing conditions. - A deviation in the application of the de-ice/anti-icing system activation procedure, due to the landing performance penalties in icing conditions on this aircraft type, which does not appear to be limited to this crew or this operator. Instead of activating the wing and horizontal stabilizer de-ice system as soon as the temperature drops below 5Â°C in the presence of visible moisture, this system is only activated by the crews when they visually observe ice on the leading edges of the wing. It is then deactivated as soon as these crews note the absence of ice on the leading edges of the wings and consider that the risk of further ice accumulation before landing is low.METAR: 09:30 UTC / 10:30 local time: LFPB 080930Z AUTO 36005KT 320V040 5000 BR OVC011 M01/M03 Q0998 BECMG BKN02010:00 UTC / 11:00 local time: LFPB 081000Z AUTO 01004KT 320V040 5000 BR OVC011 M01/M03 Q0998 BECMG BKN02010:30 UTC / 11:30 local time: LFPB 081030Z AUTO 34004KT 280V020 5000 BR OVC012 M01/M03 Q0998 BECMG BKN020Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Report number: BEA2021-0052 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: BEA   Location  Images: photo (c) BEA; Paris-Le Bourget Airport (LBG/LFPB) [F]; 08 February 2021; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) BEA; Paris-Le Bourget Airport (LBG/LFPB) [F]; 08 February 2021; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) James; Gloucestershire Airport (GLO/EGBJ); 17 March 2017; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane sustained substantial damage and the five occupants onboard were not injured. The flight crew later stated that at rotation speed, the captain applied back pressure to the control yoke; however, the nose did not rotate to a takeoff attitude. The captain attempted to rotate the airplane once more by relaxing the yoke then pulling it back again, and, with no change in the airplaneÂs attitude, he made the decision to reject the takeoff by retarding the thrust levers and applying maximum braking. The airplane overran the end of the runway onto a gravel pad where the landing gear collapsed.  The NTSB reported that the captain did not have a valid pilot certificate. A review of airmen records revealed that the FAA had issued an emergency revocation of all his certificates 2 years earlier on February 13, 2019. FAA records indicated that the reason for the emergency revocation was because he had falsified logbook entries and records for pilot proficiency checks, competency checks, and training events on 15 separate occasions while employed as a check pilot for a Part 135 operator. Probable Cause: The flight crewÂs operation of the airplane outside of the manufacturerÂs specified weight and balance limitations and with an improper trim setting, which resulted in the airplaneÂs inability to rotate during the attempted takeoff.

The aircraft was attached to the French Transport Squadron 3/61 Poitou, stationed at OrlÃ©ans Bricy Air Base (BA123). It had been equipped with a large diameter and low pressure wheel kit (IFG) for the last ten days. On the day of the accident the flight crew was to practice short field landings at Blois/Le Breuil Airfield. On the fifth landing, the pilot in command was at the controls in the right seat. He wanted to land the aircraft near the threshold of the asphalt runway 12/30, with a right crosswind of 13 kt and gusts to 18 kt. Upon contact with the ground, the crew heard a squeal of tires. The aircraft veered to the right. The right wing lifted and the left wing touched the ground in a right yaw. The aircraft exited the runway to the right and came to rest on a grass runway, 30 meters from the edge of the paved runway. Causes of the event: The causes of the event fall within the environmental, organizational, and human factors domains. The crosswind on landing was at the limits of the aircraft's operating range. The piloting of the Twin Otter, in crosswind conditions at the limits of use, is delicate and requires precision and reactivity. The constrained planning of the flights led the crew to carry out a light preparation of this flight. The recent modification of the aircraft with the half-balloon wheel kit was not sufficiently consolidated for a complete appropriation by the crews. In the absence of a formal authorization of use, the pilots discover by themselves the particularities of this new configuration. The crews have not taken the measure of the new phenomena brought by the change concerning the centering, the attitude of the aircraft and the increased effectiveness of the braking system. The crew, by a bias of habit, kept their usual reference points and acted on the controls by going to the maximum travel of these without being able to counter the drift and the slide which was installed. The repetition of the exercises since the first flight of the day could have led to a decrease in the captain's attention, favouring the occurrence of a piloting error linked to cognitive biases of habit. The ignorance of the particular phenomenon of the scrambling, known of this type of aircraft led to an underestimation of the risk associated with a very front centering. The characteristics of the mission could have favored a wrong perception of the risk. The important aeronautical experience of the crew contributed to a feeling of control. A culture of performance strongly permeates the crews of the squadron. This generates a higher level of risk acceptability. The hypovigilance of the captain is a contributing factor to the occurrence of a habit bias in this event. Finally, the pilot in the left seat adopted a passive posture due to the captain's experience, delaying the resumption of control.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA-E Report number: A-2021-01-A Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The two pilots on board were not injured. The flight crew briefed and set up for the instrument landing system approach (ILS) to runway 18, expecting to break out of the overcast cloud layer and execute a visual approach to runway 36 due to more favorable winds. Upon exiting the overcast the captain activated the airportÂs pilot controlled lighting system and the first officer saw the runway. Both pilots believed the runway that they saw was runway 36. They maneuvered the airplane visually toward the runway that was in-sight and executed a landing. Upon touchdown it became clear that they had inadvertently landed on runway 32, which they new was closed.  The airplane struck a snow berm at the edge of the intersection with runway 36, the landing gear broke from the airplane and the airplane slid to a stop. The airplane sustained damage to the landing gear, lower fuselage, wings and ventral strakes. The runway had been closed due to the large amount of snow. The runway was covered with about 4 inches of snow that had yet to be cleared. The airport manager noted that the runway lights were on due to the snowplow operations that were taking place as an aid in determining the location of the runway edge. There were no plow trucks on runway 32 at the time of the accident because they had stopped for a dinner break. Probable Cause: The flight crewÂs failure to verify the correct runway for landing, which resulted in a landing on a snow contaminated runway and resulting damage to the airplane. The illumination of the lights associated with the closed runway contributed to the accident.METAR: 00:15 UTC / 19:15 local time: KJVY 190015Z AUTO 36005KT 10SM OVC025 M01/M05 A3026 RMK AO2 T10151050 TSNO23:35 UTC / 18:35 local time: KJVY 182335Z AUTO 00000KT 10SM SCT025 BKN043 M01/M05 A3026 RMK AO2 T10141051 TSNO23:55 UTC / 18:55 local time: KJVY 182355Z AUTO 03003KT 10SM BKN025 OVC043 M01/M05 A3026 RMK AO2 T10151051 11005 21023 TSNOAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN21LA136 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: flightaware.com  NTSB   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All three on board were unhurt. During the final approach to runway 17 at Monfort, the right landing gear hit the ground hard, causing the aircraft to substantially change its trajectory and skid on the left side. The two engines impacted the ground and the propellers became detached. The aircraft finally came to rest on the runway with substantial damage. The three occupants were unharmed and left the aircraft under their own power. Probable Cause(s): Abnormal contact of the aircraft before the runway, as a result of an approach made at too low a landing angle, in an attempt by the crew to make a short landing. Contributing Factors The investigation process determined that the accident was caused by a combination of the following factors: - Loss of situational awareness of the crew, who neglected the position of the aircraft in relation to the terrain during the approach, when attempting to make a short landing, probably caused by overconfidence and by the Pilot in Command's maladjustment to flying, who was making his first flights after a 70-day inactivity, caused by health problems. - Deficient condition of the safety zone and runway thresholds, without demarcation and with unevenness, which contributed to the initial damage to the aircraft, fracture of the right landing gear and which triggered other damages to the aircraft. - Deficient airfield conditions, as it lacked the minimum signage, such as demarcation of the beginning, end and margins of the usable runway, airfield limits and wind indication; these limitations increased the crew's workload as they lacked basic guidance to perform the landing in a limited field. - Lack of supervision by the operator, who did not have a flight readjustment procedure for crews after a significant inactivity, and, instead, scheduled the Pilot to perform a demanding operation to a runway with limited conditions on the first day of his return to flight. - Lack of risk management on the part of the operator, who despite knowing the risk conditions of the Monfort runway, did not have the necessary defenses for an acceptably safe operation on it, nor did it take the necessary steps to improve its conditions with the aerodrome operator, the government of the department of VaupÃ©s. - Absence of surveillance of crews under stressful conditions, high workloads, taking into account that the company operates on restricted runways with a high probability of accidents, conditions that increase the risk considerably during the operation. - Absence of minimum signage on the runway, increasing the workload for the crew, considering that they never had a reference point to perform calculations or correct estimates during approach and landing.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Aerocivil Report number: COL-21-08-GIA Status: Investigation completedDuration: 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Aerocivil History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  24 January 2008 HK-2006 VIARCO 0 Teresita Airport sub 26 August 2020 HK-2006 ALIANSA Colombia 0 Jorge Enrique GonzÃ¡lez Torres Airport (SJE/SKSJ),San Jose del Guaviare min Location  Images: photo (c) Jaime Escobar; Barranquilla-Ernesto Cortissoz International Airport (BAQ/SKBQ); 12 December 2012 photo (c) Jaime Escobar; Barranquilla-Ernesto Cortissoz International Airport (BAQ/SKBQ); 12 December 2012 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates14-Feb-2025 10:24 ASN Updated The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The filed flight plan indicated that the flight would be conducted under the Visual Flight Rule (VFR). At 09:08 LT, in daylight conditions, the aircraft departed from Wamena. The pilot was the only person on board the aircraft and this flight was the second flight of the day for the pilot and the aircraft. Prior to the departure, there was no record or report of aircraft system malfunction. Considering that the aircraft altitude was higher than normal for the landing approach to runway 09 at Angguruk and attempting to avoid clouds, the pilot made several maneuvers over Angguruk. During that maneuver, the pilot noticed that the grass on the runway, about 50 meters from beginning of the runway 09 and the grass about 30 meters before the threshold of runway 09 had brighter color than the other grass. The pilot thought that the brighter color-grass was the grass that had been cut. When on final approach, the pilot noticed that the runway threshold markers were visible. The pilot recalled that the markers did not stand out as usual due to the color. The pilot also recalled that the area about 30 meters before the threshold runway 09 looked usable for landing, as the color was no different with the 50 meters of the beginning runway. The pilot planned to make touchdown in the very beginning of runway 09 as he did not want to use more braking to decelerate the aircraft. The aircraft touched down about 22 meters before the runway threshold, then veered to the left and stopped about 112 meters from the beginning runway 09 on heading 182Â°.

The pilot reported to the NTSB that, while back-taxiing for departure, on a snow-and-ice-covered runway in a strong crosswind, the airplane began to slide towards the left side of the runway. He corrected for the slide back towards the runway center line, but the airplane encountered a ""violent gust of wind"" and began to slide again. He applied right brake and right rudder while leaving in full right aileron, but the airplane had zero braking action. As the airplane continued to slide, he applied engine power in an attempt to increase the rudder authority and ""correct the direction back towards the runway"" to no avail. Subsequently, the airplane slid off the left side of the runway, the left wheel impacted a snowbank, and the airplane tipped to the left. The airplane came to rest in a nose down attitude, banked to the left at about a 40Â° angle, and sustained substantial damage to the left wing and aileron. The pilot added that the weather at the accident airport, about the time of the accident, was wind from 120Â° at 20 knots. The pilot was back taxiing on runway 20. Probable Cause: The pilotÂs loss of directional control during the back-taxi for departure in strong crosswind conditions which resulted in a runway excursion.

Of the 262 passengers and crew onboard, one flight attendant sustained serious injuries. The airplane was not damaged. The regularly scheduled international passenger flight was operating under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 from Cancun International Airport (MMUN), Cancun, Mexico to KDFW. According to the flight crew, the captain made a public address announcement to the flight attendants to prepare for landing between FL200 and FL190. When passing 8,500 ft on vectors for a visual approach to KDFW, the crew heard another aircraft in the area report turbulence on the ATC frequency. Subsequently, the captain called the number 1 flight attendant (FA) to notify him of the potential turbulence and ensure the flight attendants took their jumpseats. Approaching the GACHO intersection at 6,500 feet, the crew stated the aircraft experienced a moderate 'jolt' of turbulence lasting about one second. The flight crew stated that the weather was unrestricted visibility and no precipitation in the vicinity of the turbulence encounter.   At the time of the turbulence, the FAs had completed securing the cabin. One FA in the aft galley was thrown into the air and then onto the floor against the right side of the aft galley when attempting to reach her jumpseat. She injured her right hip and had to remain on the galley floor for landing. Paramedics met the flight at the gate and transported the injured FA to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a broken hip.  The number 1 FA stated that he believed the turbulence call to his position should have been an 'all call' priority as opposed to a phone call.

Of the 66 passengers and crew onboard, one flight attendant sustained serious injuries. The airplane was not damaged. The regularly scheduled domestic passenger flight was operating under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 from Salt Lake City International Airport (KSLC), Salt Lake City, Utah to KLAX. According to witnesses, upon arrival at the gate in KLAX, the flight attendant (FA) fell from the top of the main cabin doorsteps to the ramp surface below after opening the main cabin door (MCD). She was then observed standing up, climbing back up the stairs and then falling to the ramp a second time. Ramp employees immediately came to her aid and alerted the captain of the flight who subsequently called company operations and requested emergency medical personnel be sent. She was transported to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a broken left wrist, right clavicle, and ribs.  Ramp video at KSLC showed the MCD was closed without pinning the handrails when the normal procedure was for the FA to call ground handling personnel to pin the railings before closing the door. The accident flight was the FAs first flight out of Initial Operating Experience, which was performed during a flight on an ERJ-175. Normal operating procedures for the CRJ-700 MCD requires the handrails to be up and pinned prior to closing the door, however, the FA did not indicate knowledge of that procedure requirement when interviewed following the accident. The FA also indicated during the interview that prior to landing, she hit her head on an open galley compartment door and felt disoriented, dizzy, and nauseated. Subsequent to the accident, the operator issued two safety bulletins to their employees describing the lessons learned from this accident and reviewing the opening procedures for the CRJ MCD. The operator also added CRJ door operation as a top safety focus area and required a demonstration of the CRJ MCD operation to the curriculum for those FAs being instructed on ERJ-175's.    Probable Cause: the improper retraction of the main cabin door, which resulted in the flight attendant falling when she opened the door at the destination.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA21LA096 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA21LA096  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates04-Jun-2022 06:53 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

After completing the photogrammetric flight and landing at Gdansk-Lech Walesa Airport (EPGD), the airplane was parked on apron 1, stand No 1. Due to the planned return flight, the pilot submitted the flight plan and then he was waiting for a decision of his operations office. In the meantime he inspected the airplane, checked the fuel and oil quantity, and, among other things, the presence of chocks under the nose landing gear. Then he stayed in the cockpit and after about 40 minutes the pilot received the decision to return to EPRZ alone. The pilot performed the preflight procedure, started the engines, checked their operating parameters and asked the TWR for clearance to taxi to runway in use. Having received the clearance, the pilot increased the engines speed, but the airplane did not move. The pilot realized that he had not removed the chocks and left the cockpit with the engines running to remove the chocks. The pilot did not remember whether he had pulled the parking brake lever before leaving the cockpit. Having left the cockpit, the pilot moved to the area of the nose landing gear and removed the chocks, and at that point the airplane began to move. The pilot tried to stop the airplane, but tripped over the previously removed chocks and fell down. The airplane taxied over the pilot and moved towards the taxiway L. The pilot tried to catch up with the moving airplane, but failed to do so. The P68 airplane crossed taxiway L and hit the rear part of a Saab 340A, SP-KPU, parked at stand number 32. As a result of the collision, both airplanes were substantially damaged.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: SCAAI Report number: 2021 / 0572 Status: Duration: Download report: Sources: SCAAI  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates08-Jul-2024 07:47 ASN Updated The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

During descend to flight level 100 they encountered bad weather and the wings developed heavy icing. The captain activated the de-icing systems on the wings but the problem persisted. The situation prompted the captain to request Wilson Control to descend to the 'Monstry fix' for landing at HKNW which was approved. As the flight continued descending the left engine failed. The captain requested Wilson Tower for assistance. After 30 seconds, the right engine also failed. The captain elected to make an emergency landing at Ngong Racecourse. On landing, the left wing collided with trees, broke-off and separated together with the left engine and the left main landing gear.

Of the 50 passengers and crew onboard, one passenger sustained serious injuries and the first officer, flight attendant, and one passenger sustained minor injuries. The airplane was not damaged. The regularly scheduled domestic passenger flight was operating under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 from Tri-cities Airport (KTRI), Blountville, TN.  The flight crew stated they expected turbulence on arrival into KCLT, because they had flown in from KCLT on the flight prior to the accident flight. As a result, prior to pushback of the accident flight, the captain made a public address announcement that the fasten seatbelt sign would remain on and the passengers and flight attendants (FA) should remain seated for the entirety of the flight. As the flight was being vectored around severe convective activity on arrival into KCLT and approaching 12,000 feet, they encountered severe turbulence with downdrafts. The autopilot disconnected and the airplane descended below its assigned level off altitude. The first officer, who was the pilot flying, took manual control of the airplane and began climbing back to 12,000 feet. After exiting the turbulent conditions, the captain called the FA and was informed that one passenger had been injured.  According to the FA, a passenger got up while the seatbelt sign was on and was in the lavatory when the turbulence was encountered. The passenger complained of back pain as she returned back to her seat after the event. Two medically qualified passengers assisted the injured passenger inflight. After landing, paramedics transported the injured passenger to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a fractured vertebrae.   At the time of the flight's arrival into KCLT, a SIGMET was active for imbedded thunderstorms and turbulence.   Probable Cause: an encounter with convective turbulence during descent.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA21LA109 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA21LA109 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  31 October 2024 N650AE American Eagle opb.

The aircraft was pushed back from Stand 2 onto taxiway I and the tow proceeded along taxiway I and taxiway J, crossing runway 23. As the tow truck turned onto taxiway K, the tow bar became detached and the aircraft proceeded straight, entering the cargo and GSE Area and coming to rest against a bank of 4 fuel bowsers parked side by side. Conclusions: Aircraft towing is a routine operation that, despite its relatively mundane nature, requires careful operation and stringent safety procedures to ensure that incidents and accidents are avoided. This accident occurred due to a lack of adherence to such procedures, including: 1) Proper flight deck checks and aircraft setup for a towing procedure; 2) Adequate coordination between ground staff and the tug driver to ensure a safe environment that avoids the need of sudden braking by the tug; 3) Careful checking of the shear pins following a sudden or sharp braking event; 4) Correct seating of the brake operator in the pilotÂs seat during tow to be able to apply brakes in an effective and timely manner in the event of tow bar detachment. In addition, the lack of training on aircraft operating procedures and emergency evacuation procedures given to the tow crew jeopardized the safe securing of the aircraft and safe evacuation after the accident. In conclusion, the cause of the accident was identified to be: - A lack of training, clear procedures and inadequate level of attention given to safety during operation.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BAAI Report number: BAAI/ACR-002-2021 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: timesofmalta.com  https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/9h-qcj   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot and 4 passengers were not injured.  The pilot reported that, he had brushed off the snow on the airplane before refueling the airplane. The passengers then boarded the airplane, and he readied the airplane for departure. During the takeoff roll, the engine gauges were in the green and everything seemed normal. During climb out, he began to retract the flaps, and while raising the last 10Â°, the engine began to run rough. The pilot elected to abort the landing, and reduced engine power and lowered the nose toward the runway. The airplane subsequently landed hard, bounced, and came to a stop off the runway. The left main landing gear was damaged along with the left side fuselage, which sustained substantial damage.  The passengers stated that after the airplane lifted off the runway, the engine sputtered, and then the airplane touched back down on the runway. It bounced 3 or 4 times before it came to a stop. Postaccident examination of the engine, which included an engine run by the operator, revealed no evidence of any preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. A fuel sample was tested, with no discrepancies noted. Ground witnesses reported heavy snowfall and a buildup of snow on the airplane. Witnesses further reported that there were no wing covers on the wings. They also reported that the pilot had brushed off an accumulation of snow before departing.

According to the first officer, who was initially the flying pilot, they departed from Centennial Airport (APA) for a short positioning flight to Colorado Springs (COS). After departure, air traffic control provided vectors to intercept the GPS approach for 17R at COS. The crew intercepted the approach at the initial approach fix and descended as required to meet the mandatory crossing altitudes. The airplane exited the overcast cloud layer at an altitude of 650- 700 ft above ground level and the first officer had COS in sight. It was at this time that the first officer reported he realized that visually, the flight path was offset about 0,5 mile right of the runway centerline.   The captain requested control of the airplane and then made the required course correction to line up with the centerline of the runway. This correction occurred about 1,5 - 2 miles from the runway threshold. About 100 ft above the ground, the captain reduced the throttles to ""idle"", was able to establish runway centerline, and continued the descent for landing.  As the airplane descended through 10-20 ft above the runway, the captain reported that the ""stick shaker"" activated. The first officer was monitoring and announced ""stall,"" and the captain advanced both throttles. Just before the airplane touched down, it experienced an uncommanded roll to the right and the nose dropped. The captain attempted to arrest the roll by applying left aileron, but the airplane did not respond in time and the right tip tanking struck the runway surface just before the landing gear contacted the runway. The crew was able to maintain control throughout the rollout and the airplane continued to taxi and exit the runway under its own power. The airplane received substantial damage to the right wing. Probable Cause: The flight crewÂs improper decision to continue the unstabilized approach, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall and impact with the runway during landing.METAR: 15:54 UTC /  local time: SPECI KCOS 151641Z 14019KT 6SM BR OVC005 02/01 A2995 RMK AO2 DZE40 METAR KCOS 151554Z 23004KT 3SM -DZ BR OVC003 01/M01 A2998Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN21LA190 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot reported to the NTSB that, during final approach to land, he noticed a road grader operating on the far end of the runway. He made a radio transmission stating that the flight was 4 miles out on final approach and observed the road grader pull over at the opposite end of the airport and park. Believing that the operator of the road grader heard his call and parked, he proceeded with a normal approach and landing. After touchdown, he applied reverse with moderate braking. When the airplane was fully out of reverse and had slowed to about 35 mph, he noticed a large piece of foreign object debris (FOD) on the runway centerline. The FOD appeared to be about 18 inches wide and about 12 inches tall. He veered to the left in an effort to straddle the FOD with main landing gear. Subsequently, the right main landing gear struck the FOD, the right main landing gear collapsed, and the airplane slid about 75 ft down the runway centerline before coming to a stop. A postaccident inspection revealed that the FOD was a chunk of ice.

The pilot, copilot, and passengers described that the pilot descended to a lower altitude and flew along a riverbed, at times at an altitude that was below the surrounding trees and terrain. The pilot stated that he next planned on doing a touch-and-go landing on the river to entertain the passengers. One of the passengers said that while flying along the river, the pilots were concerned about hitting powerlines and had to maneuver to prevent hitting them and a bridge. Shortly after, as the pilots were following a sharp bend in the river while looking for a place to conduct a touch-and-go landing, the airplane's right wing stuck a power line. The airplane's right wing and aileron were substantially damaged, though the damage did not prohibit the airplane from being able to fly, and the pilot characterized that the airplane felt out of trim and 'a little heavier on one side.'Â The flight continued towards their destination and a subsequent conversation ensued between the pilot and the passengers, asking if the meeting could be missed, and if they should return to their departure airport, about 45 minutes away. The decision was made to return to the departure airport where the airplane landed without further incident. The pilot elected not to perform a precautionary landing at a nearby airport nor declare an emergency because the airplane appeared to be performing well.  The operator stated there were no mechanical deficiencies with the airplane that contributed to the accident. Further, the operator did not have any guidance or policies relating to low-altitude maneuvering with passengers onboard. Probable Cause: The pilot's improper decision to conduct a low altitude flight and his failure to see and avoid powerlines. Contributing was the operator's lack of safety guidance or a safety policy for low-altitude operations.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA21LA193 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  4 September 2024 N143CA Haugland Group Aviation LLC 0 East River, NY sub Wingtip, pod strike Location  Images: photo (c) FAA; 26 April 2021 photo (c) FAA; 26 April 2021 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates09-Sep-2024 16:18 ASN Updated [Source, Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All three occupants were injured. Approaching the joint military and civilian airport at Gwalior the crew were advised by ATC that runway 24L was in use. ATC then asked the crew if they would like to carry out a VOR approach for the opposite runway 06R. The crew requested for a night visual approach for runway 06R and were cleared to descend 2700 ft. After reporting that they had the airport in sight, the crew were cleared to circuit altitude. The first officer called turning right base with field visual and the flight was cleared to land which the crew acknowledged. Just before landing the aircraft and short of the threshold, the main gear collided with the raised arrester barrier and came to a halt on the runway 06R just beyond the threshold markings. Since Gwalior is a joint military/civil airport, the barrier nets were used to prevent military jets from overrunning runway 24L and were inadvertently left in a raised position. Probable cause of the Accident: 1) The PIC (PF) carrying out a visual approach at night and knowingly deviated below the visual approach path profile (3 degrees) while disregarding the PAPI indications, thereby the aircraft collided with the raised Arrester Barrier. 2) Lack of Assertiveness on the part of the Co-pilot (PM). Contributory Factors: 1) Non-Compliance to the SOP of ""Change of Runway Checklist"" by the ATC staff leading to the ""Arrester Barrier"" remaining in a ""Raised Position"" while the aircraft (VT-MPQ) came in for landing on runway 06R. 2) Non-essential conversation by the flight crew during the final approach for landing causing distraction leading to a delayed sighting of the raised Arrester Barrier. 3) Systemic failure at various levels at the Gwalior Air Force Base to ensure that the ""Arrester Barrier Position Indicator Lights and Integral Panel Lights"" were not rectified in a stipulated time period. 4) A robust alternate procedure was not defined when the ""Arrester Barrier Position Indicator Lights and Integral Panel Lights"" were unserviceable. 5) The Gwalior Airforce Base authorities did not install ""Red Obstacle Lights"" on the Arrester Barrier Poles to indicate the position of the obstacle on the date of the accident as per the DGCA requirements (CAR Section 4, Series B, Part 1).Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB India Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: timesofindia.indiatimes.com  ndtv.com   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The copilot was Pilot Flying. The flight was cleared for an RNP approach to runway 21. At 10:05 the aircraft was at 958 feet and passed the minimum descent height. The flight reported runway in sight and continued the approach.  At a distance of 1.5 nm from the runway threshold, the aircraft dropped below the glide slope.  At 10:06:14, at about 0.15 nm from the runway, the pilot called ""come and go around"", and two seconds later, the autopilot was disconnected. Four seconds later the main landing gear and tail skid struck the top of a concrete perimeter wall The flight crew continued the missed approach procedure and radioed that they suspected damage to the nose landing gear. At 10:08, the flight crew requested to return to Songshan Airport. Suspecting damage to the nose gear, the flight crew first flew a low pass over runway 10  at 10:45 hours. The tower controller at Songshan Airport reported observing damage to the right main gear wheels. The pilot decided to fly the traffic circuit with the gear down and landed on runway 10 at 11:07 hours. The aircraft and the runway surface were damaged but there were no injuries. Findings Related to Probable Cause: When the occurrence aircraft performed a non-precision approach to runway 21 of Nangan Airport, the pre-threshold area was obscured by low clouds or marine fog. During the final approach, the pilot flying used the autopilot lateral navigation and vertical speed mode for the approach. Focusing on flight operations in the cockpit, the pilot flying lost situational awareness of the aircraft position and did not realize that the aircraft altitude was very close to the runway threshold elevation. When the aircraft entered low clouds and was unable to maintain visual contact with the runway, the pilot flying did not follow the procedure of immediate execution of a go-around but continued using the autopilot for the approach, the pilot monitoring did not remind the pilot flying to execute or call for a go-around. When the pilot flying decided to perform a go-around, the aircraft had reached an altitude of 229 ft, 11 ft above the runway threshold elevation. Because the altitude was too low, before the aircraft could establish an effective positive rate of climb, the aircraftÂs main wheels and tail skid collided with the top outer edge of the pre-threshold area of runway 21, causing substantial damage to the aircraft.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TTSB Report number: TTSB-FRP-21-09-001 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: TTSB   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

At the hospital, the injured passenger received stitches to his head, and it was confirmed that he had broken his arm. The investigation has determined that the cause of the accident was the passengerâs decision to disregard the disembarkation instructions and descend the stairs with one suitcase in each hand. The stairs are approximately 0.62 m2 wide, which is sufficient for passengers to carry a single suitcase. However, as was shown in this case, it may not be enough to carry two suitcases, especially if they are separated a certain distance from the body. Moreover, anyone carrying two suitcases would be unable to grasp the handrail should they lose their balance.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIAIAC Report number: A-020/2021 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: CIAIAC Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

The Cirrus departed Denver-Centennial Airport (APA) for a local flight about 09:21, and the Metro II departed the Salida Airport (SLT) about 09:56. The Cirrus was performing a right-hand traffic pattern for runway 17R at APA, and N280KL was on final approach for runway 17L at APA, when the collision occurred. Both airplanes were in communication with air traffic control during their respective approaches to the airport. About 10:22:43, the Metro II was about 5.5 nm from APA and had completed a right turn to align with the final approach course to runway 17L. At this same time, the Cirrus was on the downwind leg of the right-hand traffic pattern for runway 17R just before he commenced a right turn to the base leg of the traffic pattern. The Metro continued its approach and remained aligned with runway 17L. The Cirrus continued the right-hand traffic pattern through the base leg, and then began to turn toward the final approach course for the runway. The airplanes collided at 10:23:53 when they were about 3.2 nm from APA. The Metro was aligned with runway 17L while the Cirrus was turning from base to final and heading about 146Â° when the collision occurred. After the impact, N280KL declared an emergency, continued to APA, and landed successfully on runway 17L without further incident. The Cirrus pilot reported that the airplane was not controllable after the impact and he deployed the Cirrus Airframe Parachute System (CAPS). The aircraft came to rest about 3 nm north of APA. Probable Cause and Findings: The Cirrus pilotÂs failure to maintain the final approach course for the assigned runway, which resulted in a collision with the Swearingen which was on final approach to the parallel runway. Contributing to the accident was the failure of the controller to issue a traffic advisory to the Swearingen pilot regarding the location of Cirrus, and the Cirrus pilotÂs decision to fly higher than recommended approach speed which resulted in a larger turn radius and contributed to his overshoot of the final approach course.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN21FA215A Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  9 March 1982 N323BA Britt Airways 0 South Bend, IN min 11 December 1986 N323BA Britt Airways 0 Paducah, KY min Location  Images: photo (c) L1011TRISTAR; Denver-Centennial Airport, CO (APA/KAPA); 12 May 2021 photo (c) NTSB; Denver-Centennial Airport, CO (APA/KAPA); 12 May 2021 photo (c) NTSB; Denver-Centennial Airport, CO (APA/KAPA); 12 May 2021 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Upon landing, the pilot kept the nose wheel in the air for as long as possible, using reverse thrust to brake the aircraft without any issues. When making a 180-degree left turn on the aircraft for taxiing to the apron, the pilot reported feeling a bump in the nose gear. As a precaution, he shut down the aircraft's engine and did not proceed with taxiing.

There were no injuries to the passengers and crew onboard either airplane.  One airplane was substantially damaged and the other received minor damage.   According to the operator, after landing, N289CT taxied to the assigned gate B-15 and was awaiting the ground marshalling crew.  The flight crew of N289CT reported that they positioned the airplane on the J-line leading to the gate parking spot and set the brake while awaiting the ground crew.  The marshallers arrived and began to signal the crew into the gate.  Shortly after releasing the parking brake, the flight crew reported feeling the airplane shudder.  The captain looked out the left window and noticed the N8686A taxiing behind with damage to its right winglet.  N289CT then proceeded to the gate and deplaned with no further incident.  Post accident inspection of the airplane revealed substantial damage to both elevators. N8686A was cleared to taxi from gate B14 to runway 22L via taxiways T and Y. While taxiing NE on taxiway Y, the aircraft's right winglet struck the aft portion of N289CT's horizontal stabilizer. N8686A taxied back to the gate.  Post accident inspection of the airplane revealed minor damage to the right winglet.

The flight crew indicated that prior to pushback, they had setup the airplane for a south departure from DFW. However, after being pushed back, they completed the After Start Checklist and then noticed that the other traffic was departing to the north. After confirming this by tuning in the Automated Terminal Information System (ATIS), they updated their departure clearance before calling the ramp for taxi clearance.

The pilot stated that, on final approach, he lowered the landing gear, placed the propeller controls forward, confirmed that the landing gear position indicator lights illuminated green, and completed the before landing checklist. He stated that he felt the drag associated with the gear being extended, but the airplane was not slowing as much as usual. As the airplane crossed the runway threshold, the pilot heard radio transmissions from the controller and another airplane to check the landing gear configuration, and he stated that he saw three green lights. He reported that the landing was smooth and felt normal; however, the airplane settled onto the runway and within a few seconds, the propellers impacted the ground. Airport surveillance video indicated that the airplane's landing gear remained fully retracted during the approach and over the runway just before touchdown. Postaccident examination of the landing gear and landing gear indicating/warning system revealed no anomalies that would have precludedÂ normal operation. The circumstances of the accident are consistent with the pilot's failure to properly configure the landing gear before landing. Probable Cause: The pilot's failure to properly configure the airplane for landing, which resulted in a gear-up landing.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN21LA248 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

According to the pilot in command, the flight and approach to the airport were normal. After the airplane touched down on the runway, he applied the brakes, however, there was no braking action from the airplane and the pilot reported that there was no compression of the brake pedals. The pilot called out that they had ""no brakes"" and elected to pull the emergency brake. The airplane began to skid, the pilot released the emergency brake, and noted that the airplane was about 45Â° off centerline and continued to turn to the left. The airplane struck the grass apron next to the runway, completed a 180Â° turn, and came to rest the opposite direction of travel in the grass to the left side of the runway. Examination of the wreckage by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed that the right main landing gear collapsed, which resulted in substantial damage to the right wing. Furthermore, the left main landing gear tire was located about 225 ft from the main wreckage. Examination of the airplane discrepancy log revealed that the left main landing gear tire was replaced the morning of the accident due to a discrepancy the pilot wrote up the day before the accident, which stated the left main landing gear tire was Âworn beyond [the] thread cords.Â  The same aircraft was involved in an incident back in 2018 at DeKalb-Peachtree Airport (KPDK).

Two passengers onboard received serious injuries and 2 passengers received minor injuries. The aircraft took off from Mumbai and the flight was uneventful throughout climb and cruise phase. Kolkata ATIS issued weather warning of TSRA and gusty winds at the time of arrival of the aircraft at Kolkata. The PF made a PA informing passenger about the expected turbulent weather during descent and advised to keep the seat belt fastened. PF also informed the SCC to secure the cabin. The aircraft was on the right of the assigned track as there were CBâs & Line squalls along the route and also to the left hand side of the route. Further to this deviation, there were similar line squalls and thunderstorms. As per the flight crew, during descent at FL390, they identified a 20 NM gap between two CBâs and decided to fly through it. While passing through the gap aircraft started experiencing light to moderate turbulence. This moderate turbulence lasted for 10-15 seconds and ended with a huge bump of severe turbulence, which lasted for 1-2 seconds.  Probable Cause of the Accident The accident occurred as the aircraft entered into a severe turbulence instead of circumnavigating it. This resulted in serious injuries to passengers who presumably did not comply withâ fasten seat beltâ sign and instructions given by cabin crew. Contributory factors to the accident were: - â¢ The flight crew was well aware about the deteriorating weather at and around Kolkata. Notwithstanding this, they continued the flight in severe weather conditions. â¢ Operatorâs Operations Manual does not provide clear cut guidance to flight crew regarding circumnavigation through the enroute bad weather (weather avoidance). â¢ At any point during the flight, the flight crew did not consider diverting to an alternate airfield even though they were not sure whether the gap is clear of any clouds. â¢ Flight Dispatch did not provide any guidance to flight crew, while they were negotiating enroute weather which was not in line with the company Flight Dispatch Manual. â¢ As the aircraft was approaching the identified gap, PIC instructed cabin crew to be seated due to which the process of seatbelt compliance and securing the cabin could not be completed.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB India Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: https://indianexpress.com/article/india/vistara-mumbai-kolkata-flight-passengers-7348273/  https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/vt-tge#27f72d6e  Video : http://www.goklerdeyiz.net/yolcu-ucagi-turbulansa-yakalandi-8-yolcu-yaralandi/  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates07-Jun-2021 19:57 Goklerdeyiz.net Added 07-Jun-2021 19:59 harro Updated [Time, Aircraft type, Total fatalities, Total occupants, Other fatalities, Location, Source, Narrative, ]07-Apr-2022 09:21 harro Updated [Total occupants, Damage, Narrative, Accident report, ]16-Jun-2024 16:53 ASN Updated [Narrative, ]17-Jun-2024 15:48 ASN Updated [Category, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The captain of the flight was Pilot Flying, the copilot was Pilot Monitoring. During approach to Hubli, the aircraft was cleared to land on runway 26. The aircraft touched down on the runway and bounced four times. All four touchdowns were hard, the first was a three point landing and on the subsequent three landings, the nose landing gear touched the runway first. After the fourth touchdown the crew initiated a go-around. During the go-around, the landing gear unsafe warning was displayed 20 seconds. However, this went unnoticed by the crew. Subsequently, when the landing gears were selected up, the landing gear unsafe indication cleared automatically. Thereafter, the aircraft climbed as per instructions of ATC Hubli and entered a holding pattern. During the second approach to the same runway 26, when the landing gears were selected down, the landing gear unsafe warning was displayed again, which was noticed by the crew. As there were three green indications on the primary display and one red indication for the nose landing gear on on the overhead panel, the crew disregarded the unsafe indication as per QRH procedure. Checklists were carried out and the landing phase was initiated. After second approach, the aircraft again touched down on runway 26 and bounced consecutively three times, before coming to rest on the runway after the fourth touchdown. Probable Cause: The probable cause of this accident is attributed to inappropriate aircraft landing technique and not following the bounced landing recovery procedure i.e., delayed flare, high speed at touchdown and delay in initiating a ""Go-Around"". Contributory factors for this accident were lack of situational awareness and lack of commitment to initiate a ""Go-Around"" after experiencing a significant bounce.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB India Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft was on stand being prepared for a cargo flight to Frankfurt (BA906). A ground maintenance team was working to address three fault messages associated with the Nose Landing Gear (NLG) doors while the flight crew prepared the aircraft for the flight. The Dispatch Deviation Guide confirmed that rectification of the defects could be deferred to a later date providing the landing gear was recycled to confirm the NLG doors functioned correctly. To prevent the landing gear from retracting when up was selected, the landing gear downlock pins were fitted. However, when the lead engineer selected the landing gear lever to up, the NLG retracted. The aircraftÂs nose struck the ground causing significant damage to the lower front section of the aircraft and inflicting minor injuries on the co-pilot and one of the cargo loading team. The NLG downlock pin had inadvertently been inserted in the downlock link assembly apex pin bore instead of the downlock pin hole. The design of the aircraft nose landing gear downlock assembly created an opportunity for error when inserting the NLG locking pin, with two holes located so close together that the pin could be inadvertently inserted in the incorrect location. A Service Bulletin and Airworthiness Directive was available that would have prevented the accident, but this had not yet been completed on G-ZBJB. AAIB Conclusions: The aircraft NLG retracted on the ground when the landing gear selection lever was selected to up as part of a maintenance procedure. The NLG downlock pin had inadvertently been inserted in the downlock link assembly apex pin bore instead of the downlock pin hole.  When the nose of the aircraft struck the ground, significant damage was caused to the lower front section of the aircraft and minor injuries to the co-pilot and a member of the cargo load team. The design of the aircraft nose landing gear downlock assembly created an opportunity for error when inserting the NLG locking pin, with two holes located so close together that the pin could be inadvertently inserted in the incorrect location. There were powerful auditory and tactile cues that could easily mislead someone to believe the pin was correctly inserted even when it wasnÂt and there were no strong visual indications to distinguish between the correct and incorrect placements. The determination of the risk of incorrect installation of the NLG downlock pin in the manufacturerÂs SB and the regulatorÂs AD did take account of the design of the B787 NLG and the associated probability for error. The operatorÂs process to embody ADs and SBs considered flight safety, airworthiness and the ADÂs ÂeffectÂ in enhancing safety, but there was no documented evidence that health and safety risks had been fully considered. Had these risks, that were clearly highlighted in the AD and SB, been given greater significance by the operator during the embodiment process, the priority of the modification may have been escalated and avoided the decision to defer implementation to the end of the compliance period.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: AAIB-27411 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: AAIB   Location  Images: photo (c) AAIB; London Heathrow Airport (LHR); 18 June 2021 photo (c) AAIB; London Heathrow Airport (LHR); 18 June 2021 photo (c) AAIB; London Heathrow Airport (LHR) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The right-hand main gear collapsed. The pilot was planning to conduct an aerial application flight on a rice field. It appeared that the pilots licence of the captain had expired in 2010. The accident with the An-2 RA-01430 aircraft occurred during takeoff from a landing strip with a non-uniform surface, which led to the aircraft yawing during the takeoff run. Correcting the directional sway, the PIC allowed a sharp operation of the brakes and wheels, which, in turn, led to an uncontrolled turn to the left, as a result of which the aircraft rolled out of the landing area and collided with a bunker. The contributing factors were most likely: - the PIC's interruptions in flight work and, as a consequence, the loss of flight skills in aircraft piloting; - failure to comply with the operator's RPM requirements in terms of training flight personnel on the An-2 aircraft; - lack of a tail wheel locking mechanism on the An-2 RA-01430 aircraft; - takeoff using the rated engine power with the flaps extended to the 20Â° position, which does not correspond to the Airplane Flight Manual of the An-2 aircraft, when taking off from a site with a non-uniform surface (take off at the engine takeoff power with the flaps deflected by 30Â°).Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight was in day visual meteorological conditions (VMC) with the visibility greater than 20 miles.  About 20 miles NW of the REDFN waypoint, near airway Q105, the flight experienced a single 'joltÃ¢â¬Â of severe turbulence, which caused the autopilot to disconnect, and the airplane to roll about 30 degrees to the right and climb about 300 feet. The PF took control and returned the airplane to its assigned altitude and reengaged the autopilot.  When the turbulence occurred beverage service had recently concluded, and two flight attendants were in the aisle collecting trash. One flight attendant was in the aft galley securing service items and was thrown to the ceiling and fell, fracturing his left ankle. Ten passengers who were not seated or who were not using their seatbelts sustained minor injuries. The fasten seatbelt indication to passengers was turned off.

The pilot performed a forced landing in a field 2 km west of Teuge Airport next to the A50 motorway.  The right wing impacted a billboard and the aircraft swung while coming to a stop against a crash barrier next to the highway. On the morning of the accident, the aircraft was parked inside the hangar of a maintenance organisation for a maintenance task before the planned flights that day. When the aircraft was on ground with the engine off, erratic and high engine Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT) readings were reported. The maintenance organisation suspected a faulty magnetic pick-up in the engineÂs propeller governor to be the cause of these erratic EGT readings. A mechanic under supervision of a licenced engineer was tasked to replace the magnetic pick-up. After removal of the old magnetic pick-up, the mechanic followed steps one through four of the maintenance manual to install the new magnetic pick-up. Steps five through eight, a system voltage test to check correct installation, were not noticed by the mechanic and as a result not carried out. After connecting the wiring and tightening the lock nut, the mechanic, together with the pilot, did a static engine test run and performed the Single Red Line (SRL) check to verify the system and EGT readings. After the system was found to be functioning correctly, the mechanic left the aircraft and the pilot taxied to the skydive organisationÂs building to pick up parachutists. Following the boarding of seventeen parachutists, the pilot taxied to runway 26 and commenced the takeoff roll. Shortly after takeoff, without any warning, the engine lost power at approximately 400 feet above field level. The pilot made an emergency landing in a field whereby the aircraft sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, wings, landing gear and propeller. One parachutist suffered minor injuries. CONCLUSIONS:  During the initial climb after takeoff, the aircraft suffered a complete loss of engine power as a result of the uncommanded feathering of the propeller. This feathering was the result of damage that occurred within the propeller governor. Most probably, the incorrect installation of the magnetic pick-up in the propeller governor prior to the accident flight led to contact damage between the pick-up and the rotating toothed gear. Debris restricted the free movement of the ball head assembly in the governor housing, allowing all oil to drain from the propeller dome and causing the propeller to continuously move to the feather position and eventually cease rotation. The increasing pitch of the propeller led to a power reduction of the engine which reinforced itself. The distorted output signal of the damaged magnetic pick-up did not cause the engine flame out. The design of the propeller governorÂs toothed gear makes it possible to position the magnetic pick-up in between its teeth. The maintenance procedure for the replacement of the magnetic pick-up did not specifically mention or address this. The final steps of this procedure, a voltage check to verify the correct placement of the pick-up, were not performed by the maintenance staff. The design of the toothed gear in combination with the procedure in the maintenance manual allowed for the incorrect installation.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Dutch Safety Board Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: http://airdatasearch.com/reg/PH-FST  omroepgelderland.nl   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The distribution of persons with reduced mobility on board the aeroplane, between the different specialist vehicles upon arrival was not shared with the crew prior to the landing and the matter was only addressed after the other passengers had disembarked. The cabin crew then had to manage an unplanned situation involving a number of passengers wanting to board a specialist vehicle beyond the vehicle?s capacity, when all of the aeroplane?s occupants were fatigued from the flight.A PRM and her travel companion did not want to be separated and chose to use the disembarkation steps to stay together. The heavy workload associated with the confused situation, as well as the behaviour (described as aggressive) of the travel companion, prevented the crew members, the arrival agent and the assistance personnel from spotting in time that the passenger was descending the steps alone and unaided. She subsequently tripped during her descent and fell to the bottom of the steps.The emergency services were alerted in compliance with the procedures in force. The public emergency services took longer to arrive than the average response time for this type of intervention at Paris-Charles de Gaulle. The crew members considered the response time to be too long, likely due to the perceived severity of the medical emergency and to their knowledge of the usually very quick response times of the ARFF in the aeronautical domain.Due to the lack of updates on the expected arrival time of the emergency services, the captain decided to issue a MAYDAY to put an end to his uncertainty. This alert, which was issued several minutes before the arrival of the emergency services mobilised first, led to the subsequent mobilisation of substantial fire fighting resources.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: https://bea.aero/en/investigation-reports/notified-events/detail/accident-to-the-airbus-a350-registered-f-htyh-operated-by-air-france-on-29-06-2021-at-paris-charles-de-gaulle/ History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  21 January 2024 F-HTYH Air France 0 TorontoâLester B.

The captain sustained serious injuries, the first officer sustained minor injuries, and the  airplane was destroyed. The aircraft took off from runway 08R at Honolulu-Daniel K. Inouye International Airport at 01:33 hours local time on a cargo flight to Kahului International Airport (OGG). As the aircraft climbed to an altitude of about 390 feet, at an airspeed of 155 knots, the EPR of the right engine dropoped to 1.43 for a period of two seconds. The aircraft then began to yaw to the right. The co-pilot corrected the tendency by using the left rudder. He stated that engine number 2 (right) had failed, which was confirmed by the captain. Upon reaching 2000 feet, the first officer (who was Pilot Flying) selected flight idle thrust. In the meantime the captain radioed Honolulu Tower that they had an emergency  The captain then instructed the co-pilot to maintain a speed of 220 knots, an altitude of 2000 feet and a heading of 240Â°. This heading the controller had given to Transair 809 on the same radio frequency about 52 seconds before. About 3 minutes and 14 seconds after the loss of power in the right engine, the captain took control of the aircraft; at that time the aircraft's speed was 224 knots and the heading was 242Â°. By then, the altitude of the aircraft had dropped from about 2100 feet to 1690 feet.  The captain pulled the nose up slightly, allowing the aircraft to climb to 1878 feet, but at the expense of airspeed, which dropped to 196 knots. Although it was determined immediately after takeoff that the right engine had failed, the crew again tried to establish the failing engine. The co-pilot then noted that the left engine had failed. The captain accepted the copilot's assessment and took no action to verify the information.  He moved the throttle of the right engine forward. The co-pilot then asked the captain if they should ""go back to the airport"" before the plane would be ""too far away."" The captain replied that the plane would stay within 15 miles of the airport. This would not interfere with other traffic and give them time to address the engine problem.  He then instructed the co-pilot to run the engine failure checklist.  While working checklist, the co-pilot noticed that the right engine's exhaust temperature (EGT) was in the red. He indicated that the power on the right engine should be reduced. The captain then decided that they  should return to the airport. Since they can no longer see the airport, Honolulu Tower issued heading instructions. Meanwhile the EGT remains deep in the red. The captain instructed the co-pilot to proceed with the engine failure checklist. But moments later, the co-pilot stopped again and stated, ""this engine is no good, we need to shut it down."" The captain agreed and ordered the right engine to be shut down.  The captain then began to steer the back toward the airport. The altitude was then only 320 feet at a speed of 180 knots. About 27 seconds before the crash, the left EPR was increased to 1.62, and the airspeed dropped to 156 knots. The captain then increased power on the left engine to maximum continuous power (1.95 EPR), but the aircraft hit the water, eleven and a half minutes after takeoff, 5.5 miles southwest of Honolulu Airport. Both pilots were able to escape from the sinking plane. The Coast Guard was alerted and an MH-65 Dolphin helicopter was on scene around 02:30. The captain was hanging from the floating tail section of the plane and the co-pilot was lying on top of floating wreckage. The captain was lifted from the water to the helicopter with the help of a rescue diver. The diver then re-entered the water and swam with the co-pilot to the rescue boat, which arrived at the scene around 02:40. The wreckage sank to a depth of about 105 meters and was salvaged in Octobter 2021. The subsequent investigation shows that two high-pressure turbine blades (Nos. 1 and 6) of the right engine had fractured. They failed by stress rupture resulting from a loss of loadbearing material due to oxidation and corrosion. Probable Cause and Findings: The flight crewmembersÂ misidentification of the damaged engine (after leveling off the airplane and reducing thrust) and their use of only the damaged engine for thrust during the remainder of the flight, resulting in an unintentional descent and forced ditching in the Pacific Ocean. Contributing to the accident were the flight crewÂs ineffective crew resource management, high workload, and stress.METAR: 10:53 UTC / 00:53 local time: PHNL 021053Z 07013KT 10SM FEW025 SCT045 26/18 A3004 RMK AO2 SLP170 T0256018311:53 UTC / 01:53 local time: PHNL 021153Z 06010G21KT 10SM FEW025 SCT050 26/17 A3003 RMK AO2 SLP169 60000 T02560172 10267 20256 56008Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA21FA174 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: cnbc.com   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; off Honolulu-Daniel K.

Of the 181 passengers and crew onboard, one flight attendant was seriously injured. The airplane was not damaged. The regularly scheduled passenger flight was operating under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 from the Dallas-Fort Worth International airport (KDFW), Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, to KMIA.    According to the flight crew, they observed convective activity that they would descend through during the approach and informed the lead flight attendant to prepare the cabin early and to take their seats. The weather radar was on, and the seatbelt sign was illuminated.  Shortly after this, as they descended through between 12,000-10,000 feet, the airplane passed through the tops of a small cumulus buildup and the flight experienced moderate turbulence.  When the turbulence was encountered, the #3 flight attendant (FA), located in the aft galley, was thrown into the air and was seriously injured after striking the floor hard.  The FAs informed the flight crew of the injury and the captain requested paramedics meet the flight at the gate.  After landing, the flight attendant was transported to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a fractured compressed vertebra. Probable Cause: an inadvertent encounter with convective turbulence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA21LA176 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA21LA176  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates02-Jun-2022 19:28 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...
