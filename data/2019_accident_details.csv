The flight crew comprised the captain (Pilot Flying, PF) and the co-pilot (Pilot Not Flying, PNF). Also, a ground engineer was on board. The purpose was to ferry the aircraft to Savonlinna to restart scheduled flights between Savonlinna and Helsinki-Vantaa.  The runway at Savonlinna was cleared from snow but there was packed snow at the edges. Because snow kept falling, the runway condition was considered 'poor', which was reported to the arriving aircraft. At 05:43 the captain reported being established on the ILS localiser. The AFIS officer reported that wind was 220 degrees at five knots and that runway 12 was free. The pilots used 20 degrees flap during the approach. According to the flight data recorder the approach was stable until the threshold. During the final approach the pilots saw the approach and runway lights well. Owing to the icing conditions they intended to use an airspeed which was 10 knots higher than the Aircraft Operations ManualÂs prescribed minimum approach speed. At the threshold their speed was 126 knots, while the approachÂs target speed was 120 knots. However, the airspeed at the touchdown zone markings was 123 knots. Contrasting from normal, the aircraft floated close to the surface for 6-7 seconds before touching down. The flight crew did not consider aborting the landing. Following the level flight the captain steered the aircraft toward the ground at a fairly high vertical speed. The aircraft touched down at 05:50, approximately 307 metres after the optimal touchdown point, on the left side of the runway. At touchdown the airspeed was 109 knots, which corresponds to the 110 knot target speed. Judging by the marks on the snow the left main landing gear hit the left snowbank on the uncleared area. The nose gear touched the runway, following which the left main gear became airborne for a moment and the right main gear touched the ground. The left main gear touched down again. After having travelled approximately 100 metres from the first touchdown point the aircraftÂs nose gear and the right main landing gear moved outside the cleared runway area. The aircraft was tracking towards the left, away from the direction of the runway. The pilots tried to turn the aircraft back towards the runway centreline. According to the markings the aircraft began to turn and started to skid sideways outside the cleared area of the runway. When the left main gear hit a high snowbank outside the runway, the aircraft began to turn more sharply to the left. The left engine stalled when snow entered its air intake. The pilots did not deploy reverse thrust. The right main gear knocked one runway edge light over. The aircraft stopped in half-metre deep snow outside the runway, at a 110 degree angle in relation to runway 12. The accident caused considerable damage to the aircraft. Both of the aircraftÂs propellers were damaged as well as the nose landing gear. The Safety Investigation Authority stated that this accident demonstrated the fact that the operating licences and air operator licences issued by the EU Member StatesÂ aviation authorities do not guarantee constant and uniform safety levels among air carriers. While the EUÂs regulations have aimed at ensuring the most open participation in tendering, they may result in overlooking the safety of aviation as one criterion in tendering. The purchaser organising the public tender for air services will not necessarily impose any safety-associated criteria because of being cautious about breaking EU competition rules and the court processes launched by losing bidders. Often the price and on-time performance are the tender criteria. Purchasers of air services do not have suitable and straightforward indicators to assess air carrier safety. Clients and purchasers may also include those that are not deeply familiar with the aviation branch. CONCLUSIONS 1. The operating licences and air operator licences issued by the EU Member StatesÂ aviation authorities do not guarantee constant and uniform safety levels among air carriers. 2. While the EUÂs regulations have aimed at ensuring the most open participation in tendering, they may result in overlooking the safety of aviation as one criterion in tendering. 3. The purchaser organising the public tender for air services will not necessarily impose any safety-associated criteria because of being cautious about breaking EU competition rules and the court processes launched by losing bidders. Often the price and on-time performance are the tender criteria. 4. Purchasers of air services do not have suitable and straightforward indicators to assess air carrier safety. Clients and purchasers may also include those that are not deeply familiar with the aviation branch. 5. The airline had not completely complied with its own safety management system. Oversight authorities do not always detect the difference between the safety management that operators promise to follow and their real-world practices. 6. At no time did the flight crew consider aborting the landing. 7. The airlineÂs operational manuals (OM-A and OM-B) were inconsistent concerning maximum crosswind components. The instructions were difficult to follow in practice. 8. Regardless of the alert to the Emergency Response Centre, no information about the airliner accident was relayed to the regionÂs divisional officer on duty because, owing to the situation assessment, there was no need to deploy rescue service units. 9. The Cockpit Voice Recorder had not recorded anything from the flight in question, and the earlier recordings that were retrieved from its memory were of extremely poor quality. The recording quality of the FDR, when compared to modern recorders, was poor. The magnetic tape of the FDR was worn, which caused defects in the recording.METAR: 03:20 UTC / 05:20 local time: EFSA 070320Z 21004KT 180V260 3000 -SN BKN006 OVC017 M02/M02 Q101103:50 UTC / 05:50 local time: EFSA 070350Z 22005KT 170V260 2500 SN BKN005 OVC015 M02/M02 Q101004:50 UTC / 06:50 local time: EFSA 070450Z AUTO 23005KT 180V270 4300 -SN OVC006 M01/M02 Q1010Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: SIAF Report number: L2019-01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) Safety Investigation Authority Finland; Savonlinna Airport (SVL/EFSA); January 2019 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The captain, first officer flight attendant, and 6 passengers on board were not injured and the airplane sustained substantial damage.  As the airplane arrived in the Uvalde area, ARTCC cleared the airplane to descend to 4,000 ft. After leveling off at 4,000 ft, the flight crew canceled their IFR clearance and proceeded to the airport visually. The pilot flew over the runway and entered a left downwind visual traffic pattern to see if there were any animals on the runway and what the windsock on the airport indicated. The pilot stated that they did not see the windsock as they passed over the runway.  There were no animals on the runway, but the air was turbulent. The flight crew called their downwind and base legs over the airport's common frequency. On base leg, the pilot had the copilot set the flaps to 30Â°. As the pilot turned the airplane onto the final approach for landing, the copilot lowered the landing gear. The airplane was 4.5 miles from the end of the runway at 2,500 ft agl and an airspeed of 170 kts. The copilot completed the ""Before Landing"" checklist. The pilot confirmed the thrust reversers were armed and called for the flaps to be set to 45Â°. At 2 miles from the end of the runway, the pilot checked his approach speed and confirmed the landing gear was down. The pilot reported there was turbulence and wind gusts from the hills below and to the west of them. As they passed 50 ft. and coming over the runway, the pilot reduced engine power to idle. The pilot reported they then encountered a windshear. Their airspeed dropped rapidly and the airplane ""was forced down"" to the runway. The pilot unlocked the thrust reversers, applied brakes, and reached to deploy the ground spoilers. As he deployed the thrust reversers, the pilot said it felt like the right landing gear collapsed. He applied full nose-left rudder and left-wing-down aileron, but the airplane continued to veer to the right. The pilot tried using the tiller to steer to the left with no response. The airplane exited the side of the runway and went into the grass. A representative for the airport reported that the airplane on landing hit hard. About two thirds of the way down runway 35, the airplane slid off the right side of the runway. The airplane proceeded through a ditch and struck a perimeter fence before coming to a stop. Probable cause: ""The airplane's encounter with wind shear on short final approach to the runway, which resulted in a hard landing and fracture of the right main landing gear.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN19LA054 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Uvalde-Ox Ranch Airport, TX; 12 January 2019 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The captain and first officer were fatally injured and the airplane sustained substantial damage. The airplane was registered to Priority Air Charter LLC and operated by AFM Hardware Inc. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the positioning flight, which was destined for Akron-Canton Regional Airport (CAK), North Canton, Ohio. The airplane was part of a test program for new, higher horsepower engine installation. Soon after liftoff and about 3 seconds after decision speed (V1), the left engine lost total power. The propeller began to auto-feather but stopped feathering about 3 seconds after the power loss. The airplane yawed and banked to the left, descended, and impacted terrain. The airplane struck power lines and trees before impacting the ground and came to rest about 200 yards from the end of runway 19. The main wreckage was upright and oriented on a northwesterly heading, with the fuselage separated forward of the wings. The left wing was broken aft and upward and the inboard leading edge of the right wing was crushed aft. The left engine was broken aft and outboard of the wing's leading edge. The right engine was broken downward at the nacelle. The nose of the airplane was located forward and left of the airplane main wreckage. Recorded engine data indicated the power loss was due to an engine flameout; however, examination of the engine did not determine a reason for the flameout or the auto-feather system interruption. While it is plausible that an air pocket developed in the fuel system during the refueling just before the flight, this scenario was not able to be tested or confirmed. It is possible that the auto-feather system interruption would have occurred if the left power lever was manually retarded during the auto-feather sequence.  The power loss and auto-feather system interruption occurred during a critical, time-sensitive phase of flight since the airplane was at low altitude and below minimum controllable airspeed (Vmc). The acutely transitional phase of flight would have challenged the pilots' ability to manually feather the propeller quickly and accurately. The time available for the crew to respond to the unexpected event was likely less than needed to recognize the problem and take this necessary action Â even as an immediate action checklist/memory item. Probable cause: The loss of airplane control after an engine flameout and auto-feather system interruption during the takeoff climb, which resulted in an impact with terrain.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN19LA056 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: news5cleveland.com  Flightaware.com  indeonline.com  NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Kidron-Stoltzfus Airfield, OH; January 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Kidron-Stoltzfus Airfield, OH; January 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Kidron-Stoltzfus Airfield, OH; January 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Kidron-Stoltzfus Airfield, OH; January 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) David Overmire; Liverpool International Airport (LPL/EGGP); 30 October 2016 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

During the take-off run from runway 26 at CYUY, the aircraft began to veer to the left.  It continued to do so until the left main landing gear rolled off the surface of the runway and hit a snow windrow 5 feet beyond the edge of the runway. The aircraft continued to veer to the left and came to rest in a compacted snowbank 40 feet from the runway. One of the passengers received minor injuries. The aircraft sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, landing gear, and propellers. The accident occurred during the hours of darkness, when visibility was reduced to approximately 2 statute miles in snow showers. Findings as to causes and contributing factors: 1. The pilot flying did not look far enough ahead for long enough to notice that the aircraft was deviating to the left before veering off the runway. 2. Given that the pilot monitoring was not looking out the window to monitor the aircraftÂs path, he did not notice the deviation and was therefore unable to help the pilot flying correct the deviation in the path during the take-off roll. 3. The strong authority gradient between the pilots reduced the effectiveness of monitoring, which resulted in a failure to detect and correct the deviation from the departure path. 4. During the takeoff-rejection procedure, the pilot flying accidentally caught the right engine power lever with his finger, pushing the lever completely forward, and placed only the left lever in the idle position, which produced a significant dissymmetry in the torque and accentuated the deviation from the path, resulting in the runway excursion. 5. Since the pilot flying was able to place only 1 power lever in the idle position, it is highly likely that he did not have his right hand on the levers, contrary to what is stated in the standard operating procedures. Consequently, he was not ready to quickly and safely reject the takeoff.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A19Q0010 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: TSB A19Q0010   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Â There were no injuries and the airplane received substantial damage.  According to flight crew statements, the crew advised the tug driver they were cleared to push back, either tail east or straight back. At the time of the accident, dark night conditions existed and the ramp was contaminated with snow.  During the pushback, the flight crew started No. 1 and 2 engines. The tug driver pushed the airplane back with its empennage towards the east and then notified the captain that he would pull forward to straighten them out. As the tug driver pulled the airplane forward and was coming to a stop the airplane's nose began to drift to the left.Â  The tug detached from the airplane and impacted the right forward fuselage and right engine air intake resulting in substantial damage. The captain noted that the nose swung to the left, and then said it felt as if the airplane was moving backwards.  According to the operator, on the morning of the accident, the ramp management company had instructed their ground personnel that all pushbacks should be straight back pushes due to the snowy conditions. It is likely that the angle of the towbar from pushing the airplane back to the east, combined with the snow contaminated ramp and the engine idle thrust, caused the tug driver to lose control of the tug during the pushback. Probable Cause: loss of control of the tug by the driver during pushback operations as a result of the contaminated ramp, angle of the towbar, and the airplane engines being at idle thrust.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA19CA079 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight departed Laredo International Airport, Texas, USA at 18:26 CST on an IFR flight plan. There were no irregularities or operational issues reported during the takeoff and enroute portion of the flight. According to the flight crew, the captain was the pilot flying when the accident occurred. At 19:58, the Birmingham Approach air traffic controller advised the crew that the wind at TCL was from 200 degrees at 4 knots. The crew acknowledged and advised that they would use runway 4. The controller instructed them to report the airport in sight. At 20:01, the crew reported the airport in sight, and the controller cleared them for the visual approach. There was no communication regarding any difficulty with the airplane. According to the flight crew, about 12 miles from the airport the captain called for flaps 15 and gear down. After the gear was selected down, the CVR recorded the first officer stating, ""yeah it's down, but [unintelligible] the lights [unintelligible]"" The crew reported that they noted a red warning light for the nose gear position, and heard the audible gear warning horn.

The aircraft sustained significant damage to the right side of the fuselage that affected the airframe, the hydraulic system and the landing gear. Causes/Contributing factors:  The investigation has determined that the accident was caused by the loss of control of the aircraft on the ground in conditions close to the maximum demonstrated cross wind limit due to the fact that this maneuver was not performed according to the procedure published by the manufacturer.  The following are considered to be contributing factors: - The absence of communication between crew members on cross wind landing technique during the approach briefing. - The surprise and shock effect on the crew produced by the behaviour of the aircraft in the first moments after the landing, which affected negatively their subsequent actions and caused them to react instinctively instead of applying the procedure published by the manufacturer.METAR: 16:00 UTC / 17:00 local time: LEPA 281600Z 32026G40KT 9999 FEW020 15/05 Q1006 NOSIG16:30 UTC / 17:30 local time: LEPA 281630Z 32024G34KT 290V350 9999 FEW020 14/06 Q1007 NOSIG 17:00 UTC / 18:00 local time: LEPA 281700Z 32024G34KT 9999 FEW020 14/06 Q1007 NOSIG Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIAIAC Report number: A-004/2019 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: CIAIAC History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  13 September 2011 OY-CIM Cimber Sterling 0 Copenhagen-Kastrup Airport (CPH/EKCH) min Engine failure 19 February 2021 EC-LYJ Swiftair 0 Palma de Mallorca Airport (PMI/LEPA) min Tire failure Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the destination airport.  The flight departed Anchorage-Ted Stevens International Airport (PANC), Alaska, about 16:04 destined for Kake. At 18:07 the Anchorage Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) cleared the flight for the area navigation (RNAV) runway 11 approach to Kake. The accident airplane crossed the CEMGA waypoint on the RNAV runway 11 approach at an altitude of about 7,000 ft, then turned northeast and crossed the ZOLKO initial approach fix about 5,000 ft msl. The airplane then initiated a gradual descent and continued northeast toward the JOJOE intermediate fix. About 18:10, while the flight was between ZOLKO and JOJOE, the airplane entered a right turn toward a southerly heading and began a rapid descent, losing about 2,575 ft of altitude in 14 seconds.

Both pilots were killed. The aircraft operated flight 503, an instrument flight rules flight itinerary from Yellowknife to WhatÃ¬ Airport, WekweÃ¨tÃ¬ Airport, and Ekati Aerodrome.  During the flight preparations at Yellowknife the first officer (FO) noted that the right-side vacuum-driven attitude indicator was not erect. The captain assured the FO that the instrument would start to operate. The flight took off from Yellowknife at 08:51. During the climb, while working the after-takeoff checklist, it appeared that the right-side ADI still wasn't working. The captain suggested to the FO that he should tap the attitude indicator to see if it was stuck or frozen. The FO replied that the attitude indicator was still not erect. While en route at FL120 the pilots attempted to troubleshoot the right-side attitude indicator, but to avail.  At 09:11, after having commenced the descent, the captainÂs attitude indicator on the left-side instrument panel displayed a red ""GYRO"" flag and the autopilot disconnected. At this time the captain began to manually fly the aircraft with partial flight instruments. The aircraft continued to descend, and the captain attempted to initiate a climb. The aircraft climbed briefly before beginning to descend again. The aircraft subsequently entered a gradual left turn that progressed into a steep descending left turn (spiral) from which the aircraft never recovered. The investigation established that both the captain and the FO had an iPad mini equipped with the ForeFlight Mobile application which had the capability to provide a backup attitude indication and synthetic vision view to both pilots. Since it was a backup feature, Air Tindi did not have a formal training program in place for using the attitude and heading reference system (AHRS) feature of ForeFlight. Findings as to causes and contributing factors: 1. For undetermined reasons, the left-side attitude indicator failed in flight. 2. Although just before take off the crew acknowledged that the right-side attitude indicator was not operative, they expected it to become operative at some point in the flight. As a result, they did not refer to the minimum equipment list, and departed into instrument meteorological conditions with an inoperative attitude indicator. 3. The crewÂs threat and error management was not effective in mitigating the risk associated with the unserviceable right-side attitude indicator. 4. The crewÂs crew resource management was not effective, resulting in a breakdown in verbal communication, a loss of situation awareness, and the aircraft entering an unsafe condition. 5. The captain did not have recent experience in flying partial panel. As a result, the remaining instruments were not used effectively and the aircraft departed controlled flight and entered a spiral dive. 6. The captain and first officer likely experienced spatial disorientation. 7. Once the aircraft emerged below the cloud layer at approximately 2000 feet above ground, the crew were unable to recover control of the aircraft in enough time and with enough altitude to avoid an impact with terrain.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A19W0015 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: CBC  Transport Canada History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  5 April 2014 C-GTUC Discovery Air International 0 Near Cambridge Bay Airport min Windscreen cracks or failure Location  Images: photo (c) TSB; WhatÃ¬/Lac La Martre Airport, NT (YLE); 30 January 2019 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The captain was the pilot flying and the first officer was the pilot monitoring. The en route flight, the descent and the initial approach for runway 27 at Billund proceeded uneventfully, with the aircraft being radar vectored for an Instrument Landing System (ILS) approach. On final approach to runway 27, Billund Tower cleared the aircraft to land and reported the wind conditions to be 200Â° 12 knots (kts), maximum 29 kts, and minimum 5 kts. Throughout the approach, the flight crew experienced moderate turbulence. The flight crew modified final approach speed (VAPP) was 148 kts (the flight crew added 2 kts the calculated VAPP of 146 kts). At 1000 ft, and at 500 ft Radio Height (RH), the first officer made calls on stabilized approach. The aircraft was configured for landing, with flap position 3, stabilized, and the autopilot engaged and the autothrust engaged and activated in SPEED mode. At approximately 700 ft RH, the flight crew got visual contact with the runway. The Calibrated Air Speed (CAS) from 500 ft RH down to initial touchdown varied between approximately 160 kts CAS and 145 kts CAS. The aircraft remained stabilized on both localizer and glidepath down to 100 ft RH. On short final, the first officer informed the captain of a displayed crosswind of 36 kts. At approximately 190 ft RH, the captain disconnected the autopilot and flew the final approach manually with the autothrust engaged and activated in SPEED mode. At 100 ft RH, the first officer made a standard operating call on aircraft pitch attitude: Pitch 2.5. From approximately 100 ft RH until 35 ft RH, the vertical speed increased from approximately 700 ft/minute (min) to approximately 1100 ft/min. At approximately 25 ft RH, the captain used an abrupt and progressive aft sidestick input and pulled back on the sidestick to full aft  deflection to stop the rate of descent. The synthetic voice calls TWENTY, RETARD and the initial touchdown occurred almost simultaneously. Before recorded activation of both main landing gear squat switches (weight on wheels - WOW), the captain advanced the thrust levers forward of the climb detent position. The aircraft made an initial touchdown at approximately 148 kts CAS, with a recorded pitch angle of 5.63Â°, a rate of decent of approximately 750 ft/min, and a vertical acceleration of 2.59 g. Upon initial touch down, the ground spoilers did not extend, and the autothrust deactivated. The aircraft lifted off the ground and up to 12 ft RH. During the bounce, the captain repeatedly voiced his surprise on the lack of flare. In the air, the engines spooled up, and the CAS increased to approximately 156 kts. Two synthetic voice calls on excessive pitch (PITCH), and one thrust lever retarding synthetic voice call (RETARD) sounded. The captain retarded the thrust levers to flight idle resulting in ground spoiler extension. The aircraft made a second touchdown at approximately 154 kts CAS, with a recorded pitch angle of 9.49Â° and a vertical acceleration of 2.56 g. The aircraft tail section struck the runway. Upon landing, neither of the pilots perceived that a tailstrike might have occurred, and the flight crew continued taxiing to the apron. During taxi to the apron, the captain briefed the passengers on the hard landing. The AIB considers the contributing factors to this specific tailstrike to be: - Gusting and strong crosswinds in dark night. - Moderate turbulence and downdrafts on short final to runway 27 at EKBI. - Too high sink rate, just prior reaching the flare height (destabilization). - No flight crew calls and/or decision on going around on short final or during the bounce. - Two hard landings. - Inappropriate thrust lever management. - Inappropriate pitch control during the bounce resulting in a pitch angle increasing beyond the critical angle.METAR: 17:20 UTC / 18:20 local time: EKBI 021720Z 35006KT 5000 BKN007 00/M00 Q100318:20 UTC / 19:20 local time: EKBI 021820Z 33007KT 7000 SCT007 BKN025 00/M01 Q1004Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: HCLJ Report number: 2019-57 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SHK   Location  Images: photo (c) AIB Denmark; Billund Airport (BLL); February 2019 photo (c) AIB Denmark; Billund Airport (BLL); 08 February 2019 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The captain was fatally injured, and the co-pilot was seriously injured. The airplane was operated by Conquest Air Cargo on a cargo flight from Opa Locka to Nassau, Bahamas and back. The flight to Nassau was normal until the co-pilot had to adjust the left engine propeller control to adjust speed for cruise flight. When he manipulated the control, there was no movement on the gauge and the power was stuck at 2,400 RPM. He tried to re-set the propeller control circuit breaker, but to no avail. The captain equalized power on both engines and the flight was uneventful to Nassau. Once on the ground, the captain asked the co-pilot to send a text message to maintenance control, but the message never transmitted. The captain told the co-pilot not worry about it and if they were unable to re-set the propeller control on the ground during the engine run-up then they would shut down and call maintenance. The co-pilot stated to the NTSB that before they began the accident flight, the engines started normally and both propellers were cycled. The left propeller control had re-set itself and they departed for Opa Locka. The co-pilot was Pilot Flying on the return leg and everything was normal until climbing through 4,000 ft when the left engine propeller control stopped working and the power was stuck at 2,400 RPM. The captain tried to adjust the control and bumped the power up to 2,700 RPM. The captain took control of the airplane and tried to stabilize the power on both engines. He leveled off at 4,500 ft, cancelled their instrument flight rules flight plan, and flew via visual flight rules direct to Opa Locka. The flight was normal until they began their descent down to 1,500 ft. The right engine suddenly backfired and began to surge. The flight crew used the checklist to feather the propeller and shut down the engine. Shortly after the left engine backfired and began to surge. As the captain flew the airplane, the co-pilot attempted to handle the emergency. Once he realized they were too low and were going to ditch, he asked the captain what he wanted to do. The captain told him to declare a May Day and brace for impact. The co-pilot said the impact with the water was violent and the tail had separated from the empennage. The fuselage was filling up rapidly with water. He unbuckled his seat belt/shoulder harness, grabbed the life raft and exited the airplane. Probable Cause: ""The captain's decision to continue with the flight with a malfunctioning left engine propeller control and the subsequent loss of engine power on both engines for undetermined reasons, which resulted in ditching into the ocean. Contributing to the accident was the first officer's failure to challenge the captain's decision to continue with the flight.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA19LA096 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Miami Herald  Flightradar24  Flightaware  Coast Guard  NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) Flightaware / Google Earth; off Bay Harbor Islands, FL; 08 February 2019 photo (c) Reiner Geerdts, via Werner Fischdick; Opa-Locka Airport, FL (OPF/KOPF); 24 January 2019 photo (c) Jaime Escobar; Opa-Locka Airport, FL (OPF/KOPF); April 2012 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The three occupants were uninjured. The airplane sustained substantial wing and fuselage damage. After reviewing the weather at the destination airport the pilots decided they would be landing on runway 24 using the GPS approach. They reviewed weather at least ""4 or 5 times"" on the installed avionics display and the pilot stated that the displayed information indicated conditions of 1.5 miles visibility, ceiling of 1,500 ft, wind 090 at 4 knots, with fog and mist. The crew discussed the approach and talked about having a 4 knot quartering tailwind. When the airplane was near Richmond, the first officer listened to the automated weather observing system recording and it was reporting 3/4 mile visibility and 1,500 ft ceiling, scattered 300, wind 090 at 4 knots, temp 0C, dew point 0 C, altimeter 30.13 inches of mercury.

The airplane was about ""300 ft"" and the first officer called the runway to the left. The pilot looked up and saw the precision approach path indicator lights to the left and the runway straight ahead. However, the runway appeared to have a ""very light coating of snow on it."" The pilot elected to land and apply full thrust reverse and braking. The pilot also queried the first officer about the spoilers and the first officer confirmed the spoilers were out. A few seconds later the pilot felt the airplane was not slowing much and advised the first officer that the airplane was going to go off the end. At that point, the first officer said that he saw the 2,000 ft marker ahead of the airplane. Both pilots were pushing the brakes as hard as they could and full reverse was applied. The airplane went off the end of the runway and ended up across a road near the runway.

Of the 75 passengers and crew onboard, one flight attendant sustained serious injuries while two flight attendants and two passengers received minor injuries. The airplane sustained minor damage. The flight  was operating under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 as a regularly scheduled passenger flight from the John Wayne-Orange County Airport (KSNA), Santa Ana, California to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (KSEA), Seattle, Washington.  According to the flight crew, about 40 minutes into the flight when the airplane was in smooth air and 'between cloud layers', the captain informed the flight attendants that they could begin cabin service but left the seatbelt sign illuminated for passengers because there was a report of 'occasional light chop'. About 20 minutes later, the flight encountered an area of severe turbulence that lasted about 8 seconds and caused the airplane to rapidly gain altitude and the traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS) to issue a resolution advisory (RA) for opposite-direction traffic 1,000 ft above them. The first officer (FO) , who was the flying pilot, disengaged the autopilot and applied forward control pressure to comply with the RA.  The FO could not obtain the target flight path vector directed by the TCAS, so the captain assisted on the controls to obtain the desired pitch attitude. After the airplane descended back to its assigned altitude, the TCAS RA cleared, and the captain informed air traffic control of the turbulence and TCAS RA. According to the flight attendants (FA), the turbulence was encountered as they were beginning the beverage service. Two of the FAs impacted the ceiling before falling to the floor and one passenger, who had been in the lavatory at the time of the encounter had a small head laceration. As a result of the injuries, the captain declared an emergency and the flight diverted to KRNO. The FA in the aft galley was assisted by a medically qualified passenger and remained on the floor until landing due to her injuries. She was transported to the hospital and diagnosed with a broken arm.  Post accident examination of the weather satellite data depicted cloud patterns aloft consistent with the presence of a convective updraft coincident with the flight's location at the time of the turbulence encounter. The convection appeared to be Ã¢â¬ÅembeddedÃ¢â¬Â with stratiform clouds and may not have been visually identifiable by the flight crew. Probable Cause: an inadvertent encounter with convective turbulence that resulted in a TCAS RA, which required an abrupt control input by the flight crew to resolve the conflict.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA19CA081 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA19CA081  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates14-Feb-2019 08:20 Goklerdeyiz.net Added 15-Feb-2019 18:30 Captain Adam Updated [Time, Other fatalities, Location, Narrative, ]08-Mar-2019 08:56 harro Updated [Time, Total occupants, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, ]31-Mar-2021 08:22 ASN Update Bot Updated [Time, Other fatalities, Nature, Destination airport, Source, Damage, Narrative, Category, Accident report, ]31-Mar-2021 10:47 harro Updated [Nature, Source, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

Of the 145 passengers and crew onboard, one flight attendant sustained serious injuries and one received minor injuries. The airplane was not damaged. The flight was operating under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 as a regularly scheduled passenger flight from Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport (KBZN), Bozeman, Montana, to KATL. According to the flight crew, air traffic control informed them to expect light and occasional moderate turbulence during the descent. About 10 minutes before beginning their descent, the flight crew illuminated the seat belt sign and instructed the flight attendants (FA) to stow the carts and take their seats. Shortly after departing FL350 for FL250, and the airplane encountered two 'rapid-bumps of light-moderate turbulenceÃ¢â¬Â at approximately FL345. The flight crew slowed the airplane and contacted the FAs and was informed that the aft FA was injured. According to the flight attendants, the flight had been routine, having experienced only occasional light turbulence. The two aft FAs had finished their meal service and secured the galley. The two FAs were making their final walkthrough of the cabin when the captain made the public address announcement to discontinue cabin service, when the turbulence was encountered. The two aft FAs reported they were thrown up to the ceiling and then came 'crashing back downÃ¢â¬Â onto the galley floor. One of the FAs was in intense pain after striking the floor hard and was attended to by two medically qualified passengers. The FA was moved to an empty passenger row for landing and was provided oxygen and pain medication. The flight crew declared an emergency and requested paramedics meet the flight at the gate. The FA was transported to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a fractured vertebra. Post accident examination of the weather data determined that the accident flight was in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) in an area of convectively induced turbulence due to embedded rain shower activity when the turbulence was encountered. While there was no lightning activity around the accident site at the accident time, there were pockets of strong rain shower cells within the complex of precipitation as a whole. The area where the accident occurred was covered by AIRMET Tango that warned of moderate turbulence conditions. Probable Cause: an encounter with convective turbulence during descent.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA19CA091 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA19CA091 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  19 June 2010 N3730B Delta Air Lines 0 New York-John F.

All three on board were killed. The aircraft departed Miami International Airport, Florida at 11:33 hours local time (16:33 UTC) on a cargo flight to Houston-George Bush Intercontinental Airport, Texas, USA. The cruising altitude of FL400 was reached after 20 minutes. Descent towards Houston was commenced at 12:07 hours local time (18:07 UTC).  About 12:30 the pilots contacted the Houston terminal radar approach control (TRACON) arrival controller and reported descending for runway 26L; the airplane was at 17,800 ft with a ground speed 320 knots. As the flight descended toward the airport, the flight crew extended the speedbrakes, lowered the slats, and began setting up the flight management computer for the approach. The FO was the pilot flying, the captain was the pilot monitoring, and the autopilot and autothrottle were engaged and remained engaged for the remainder of the flight.  At 12:34, the airplane was descending through 13,800 ft, and the controller advised of an area of light to heavy precipitation along the flight route and that they could expect vectors around the weather. About 12:35, the flight was transferred to the Houston TRACON final controller, and the pilot reported they had received the Houston Automatic Terminal Information System weather broadcast. The controller told the pilots to expect vectors to runway 26L and asked if they wanted to go to the west or north of the weather. Radar data indicated the airplane continued the descent through 12,000 ft with a ground speed of 290 knots, consistent with the arrival procedure. The pilots responded that they wanted to go to the west of the area of precipitation. The controller advised that to do so, they would need to descend to 3,000 ft expeditiously. About 12:37, the controller instructed the pilots to turn to a heading of 270Â°. Radar data indicated the airplane turned, and the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) data indicated a selected heading of 270Â°. The airplane was descending through 8,500 ft at this time. About 12:38, the controller informed the pilots that they would be past the area of weather in about 18 miles, that they could expect a turn to the north for a base leg to the approach to runway 26L, and that weather was clear west of the precipitation area. The pilots responded, ""sounds good"" and ""ok.""  At this time, radar and ADS-B returns indicated the airplane levelled briefly at 6,200 ft and then began a slight climb to 6,300 ft. Also, about this time, the FDR data indicated that some small vertical accelerations consistent with the airplane entering turbulence.  At 12:38:31, the airplaneÂs go-around mode was activated. Shortly after, when the airplaneÂs indicated airspeed was steady about 230 knots, the engines increased to maximum thrust, and the airplane pitch increased to about 4Â° nose up. The airplane then pitched nose down over the next 18 seconds to about 49Â° in response to nose-down elevator deflection. The stall warning (stick shaker) did not activate. FDR, radar, and ADS-B data indicated that the airplane entered a rapid descent on a heading of 270Â°, reaching an airspeed of about 430 knots. A security camera video captured the airplane in a steep, generally wings-level attitude until impact with the swamp. FDR data indicated that the airplane gradually pitched up to about 20 degrees nose down during the descent. The NTSB found that the first officerÂs repeated uses of incomplete and inaccurate information about his employment history on resumes and applications were deliberate attempts to conceal his history of performance deficiencies and deprived Atlas Air and at least one other former employer of the opportunity to fully evaluate his aptitude and competency as a pilot. He had a long history of training performance difficulties and his tendency to respond impulsively and inappropriately when faced with an unexpected event during training scenarios at multiple employers suggest an inability to remain calm during stressful situations; a tendency that may have exacerbated his aptitude-related performance difficulties. Probable Cause: The NTSB determines that the probable cause of this accident was the inappropriate response by the first officer as the pilot flying to an inadvertent activation of the go-around mode, which led to his spatial disorientation and nose-down control inputs that placed the airplane in a steep descent from which the crew did not recover. Contributing to the accident was the captainÂs failure to adequately monitor the airplaneÂs flightpath and assume positive control of the airplane to effectively intervene. Also contributing were systemic deficiencies in the aviation industryÂs selection and performance measurement practices, which failed to address the first officerÂs aptitude-related deficiencies and maladaptive stress response. Also contributing to the accident was the Federal Aviation AdministrationÂs failure to implement the Pilot Records Database in a sufficiently robust and timely manner.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NTSB/AAR-20/02 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Flightradar24  Atlas Air statement  FAA statement  NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Trinity Bay, near Anahuac, TX; February 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Trinity Bay, near Anahuac, TX; February 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Trinity Bay, near Anahuac, TX; February 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Trinity Bay, near Anahuac, TX; 23 February 2019 photo (c) Flightaware; Trinity Bay, near Anahuac, TX; 23 February 2019 photo (c) NTSB; Trinity Bay, near Anahuac, TX; 23 February 2019 photo (c) NTSB; Trinity Bay, near Anahuac, TX; 23 February 2019 photo (c) NTSB; Trinity Bay, near Anahuac, TX; 23 February 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Trinity Bay, near Anahuac, TX; 23 February 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; 02 March 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; March 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) Jaime Escobar; Miami International Airport, FL (MIA/KMIA); 26 October 2017 photo (c) Reiner Geerdts; Miami International Airport, FL (MIA/KMIA); 19 January 2019 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft slid sideways off the left side of the runway and became stuck in snow.  The six occupants were not injured. The aircraft operated on a flight from Baku, Azerbaijan. The en route and descent part of the flight were uneventful. The flight crew performed an ILS approach to runway 24C at Sheremetyevo Airport. The aircraft was cleared to land on runway 24C and wind was reported from 300Â° at 5 m/s (10 kts) with gusts to 10 m/s (20 kts). At a height of 80 meters, the captain switched off the autopilot and continued manually. The aircraft touched down at an airspeed of 150 knots, 250 m pas the runway threshold. Brakes were applied and the thrust reversers were deployed. During rollout the no.2 engine was brought back to idle and the thrust reverser stowed. The no.1 (left) engine remained at maximum reverse, causing the aircraft to swing to the left, off the side of the runway. Conclusion: The reason for the accident with the Gulfstream G200 4K-AZ88 was the stowing of the right-engine reverser by the captain from maximum thrust reversal while maintaining maximum thrust reversal on the left engine, which led to the appearance of a significant turning moment to the left. The aircraft turning to the left in the presence of a cross wind to the right, as well as turbulence of the airflow near the rudder due to the open thrust reversal mechanism of the left engine and possible ice deposition on the outer surfaces of the aircraft, which led to the development of a significant swing moment on the rudder. The development of a significant articulated moment on the rudder, in the absence of power steering in the rudder control system, led to its deviation to the leftmost position despite significant (up to 82 kg or 180 pounds) forces exerted by the crew on the pedals. The deviation of the rudder (pedals) to the left also led to the deviation of the nose wheel to the left. The total moment from the running reverse of the left engine, from the right engine in direct draft mode, and from the rudder and nose wheel deflection to the left, led to the aircraft rolling out of the runway and its damage. Separate braking applied by the crew could not prevent the aircraft from rolling out. The contributing factors could have been: - the crew did not take into account the provisions of the AOM about the possible ""destabilizing"" effect of the thrust reverse when landing with a cross wind on the runway with a reduced braking coefficient; - increased psycho-emotional tension of the crew members due to long dissatisfaction and emotional discussion of instructions and actions of ATC controllers.

Of the 219 passengers and crew onboard, one flight attendant received serious injuries and one received minor injuries. The airplane was not damaged. The regularly scheduled domestic passenger flight was operating under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (KDFW), Dallas, Texas, to PHNL. The captain was the pilot flying and the first officer was monitoring. The flight had been unremarkable, with a smooth ride while cruising at FL380, in good visual meteorological conditions (VMC). The flight crew stated that about 15 mins before decent they checked the weather with Honolulu Control Facility (HCF) and was informed of turbulence ""light to moderate all alts"". The captain called the purser and informed him of the expected turbulence and to prepare for the arrival early by stowing the carts and securing the cabin. The seat belt sign was on. About 15 minutes later, they began their initial descent and encountered moderate to severe clear air turbulence about FL310, which lasted about 10 to15 seconds.  The ride smoothed out at about FL290, and the flight crew then received a call from the cabin, indicating that two flight attendants in the aft galley had been injured.  After landing both injured flight attendants were transported to a hospital where one was diagnosed with a fractured vertebra. Probable Cause: the airplanes encounter with clear air turbulence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA19CA088 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA19CA088  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates15-Jun-2023 04:17 Ron Averes Updated Corrections or additions? ...

While the aircraft was being prepared for flight, both pilots reported being aware of a sweet-smelling odour after the APU and APU bleed had been turned on to heat the cabin. They described the smell as being like caramel but considered that such odours were not unusual after the APU is started and the air conditioning is switched on at the beginning of the day. Following completion of passenger boarding, the aircraft pushed back and taxied before being cleared to enter Runway 26, back-track and line up for take-off. It was daylight, the visibility was in excess of 10 km and the wind was from 210Â° at 5 knots. The APU was shut down as the aircraft entered the runway and the air conditioning packs remained on with air supplied from the engines. A few seconds later, while back-tracking, both pilots became aware of fumes in the flight deck with a different odour, which the co‑pilot described as being like paint or white spirit. The wind was behind the aircraft at this point, so they initially thought the fumes were due to exhaust gas ingestion. Upon lining up at the runway threshold the flight crew had a brief discussion about whether the fumes were decreasing and decided that they were. Upon receiving take-off clearance, the co-pilot advanced the thrust levers to 40% while holding the aircraft on the brakes and checked the engine indications, which were all normal. He then slowly advanced the thrust levers towards the take-off setting, while still holding the aircraft on the brakes. As the engines reached approximately 55% power, he saw something out of the corner of his eye which he believed to have been a puff of smoke coming from an air conditioning vent. He immediately stated that he was not happy with the situation and retarded the thrust levers to idle. By then the smell of fumes had grown worse and smoke was visibly entering the flight deck. The commander set the park brake and asked the co-pilot to turn the engine bleeds and air conditioning packs to off and the flight deck windows were opened to ventilate the flight deck. There were no EICAS messages or warnings. The commander established contact with the senior cabin crew member (SCCM), who had simultaneously been trying to contact the flight deck. The SCCM reported that there was smoke and fumes in the cabin, but that the cabin crew could not identify the source. The commander decided to evacuate the aircraft. The co-pilot immediately selected flap 5, notified ATC of the intention to evacuate and requested assistance. Both pilots then carried out the Emergency Evacuation âvital actionsâ.  During the evacuation, passengers who evacuated via the over-wing exits reported being unsure of how to get down from the wing to the ground and several re-entered the cabin and exited via one of the escape slides. The smoke and fumes were subsequently attributed to an incorrectly performed engine compressor wash procedure, which was carried out by maintenance personnel the night before the occurrence flight. As a result of the findings of this investigation, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has undertaken two safety actions relating to the certification requirements for over-wing emergency exits. The operator has also undertaken several safety actions relating to passenger safety briefings, processes for maintenance planning, engineer training, competency and welfare and monitoring of ground equipment. Four Safety Recommendations are made relating to the certification requirements for over-wing exit markings and the height requirement for over-wing exits to be equipped with an assisted means of escape.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: AAIB-25591 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: 1.

The No 1 engine had been shut down in accordance with the operatorâs SOPs. As it approached the stand, at walking pace, the commander applied the brakes, which had no effect and the aircraft hit signage and the rotating No 2 (right) propeller struck a nearby ground power unit (GPU).  During the collision the aircraft sustained damage to the nose fuselage behind the radome, a nose landing gear door and right propeller tips. There were no injuries to the passengers or crew. There were a series of minor factors which coincided to cause this accident. The landing was the last of a day which had consisted of repeated and routine sectors. The absence of the approach checks meant that the aircraft was not configured correctly in preparation for the operatorâs SOP in which, after landing, the No 1 engine is shut down and the aircraft taxied to the stand on the No 2 engine. That did not predestine the aircraft to remain in this incorrect configuration. There was a further intervention during the after landing checks with the check of the stby hyd press and ptu cntrl advisory light. However, this check was also overlooked when the crew were distracted by remembering that the aircraft required an OSG check after the last flight of the week which then interrupted the after landing checks. After this, there were no other prompts during the remainder of the taxi by which to indentify the situation. When the accident sequence was underway, and the crew realised what was happening, the co-pilot remembered the stby hyd press and ptu cntrl were off and tried to switch them on, by which time it was too late.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: EW/G2019/03/01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: AAIB Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates11-Jun-2023 14:26 harro Added Corrections or additions? ...

The landing of the aircraft occurred under unfavorable weather conditions caused by heavy rain over the airfield and sudden variation in the direction and intensity of the surface wind. At the exact moment of the touch down, the wind was from a direction of 057Â° at 19kts. The contact of the aircraft with the ground occurred about 916m beyond the threshold of runway 15 with the right main landing gear completely outside the lateral limits of the runway, at a speed of 121kts. After landing, the aircraft traveled 668m outside the runway. The pilot regained control of the aircraft and returned it to runway 15. Contributing factors. - Control skills Â a contributor. The corrections applied to the flight commands, in order to control the tendency of the aircraft to laterally deviate to the right in relation to the center of SBGL runway 15, were not sufficient to stop this movement, nor to redirect the aircraft to the central axis of flight. Consequently, the aircraft touched the ground with the right main landing gear outside the runway's lateral limits. - Organizational climate Â undetermined. When considering the organizational climate present in the company at the time of the occurrence, it is possible that this scenario has influenced the assessments and, consequently, the crew's decision to proceed with the landing, despite the adverse conditions encountered. - Adverse meteorological conditions Â a contributor. The significant change in the direction and intensity of the wind in the final approach, which started to blow from the left abeam, and the increase in the intensity of the rain on the Aerodrome, which impaired the pilots' peripheral vision and compromised the exact notion of depth of the aircraft in relation to the runway, contributed to the drifting movement of the aircraft to the right side of the SBGL runway 15. - Crew Resource Management Â a contributor. When the aircraft was flying below 100ft height, the copilot conducted several callouts stating that the aircraft was off the runway axis. The commander collated the first ones, however, after a certain moment; he no longer properly responded to the copilot's callouts and proceeded to land, despite the repeated alerts received. The copilot, even realizing that the commander's corrections were not enough to control the aircraft and return it to the central axis of the runway, did not ask the commander, more assertively, to execute a go-around procedure in flight. This showed that the crewmembers had enough information to discontinue the landing, but they chose not to use this feature, which contributed to the occurrence. - Piloting judgment Â a contributor. There was an incomplete assessment of the aircraft's flight conditions. Once the tendency of lateral deviation to the right of the central axis of the runway was detected, the pilots thought it possible to correct this tendency in time to make the landing safely, which contributed to the outcome of the occurrence. - Perception Â a contributor. The maintenance of the focus on the lateral deviation of the aircraft interfered in the identification of other variables present, such as the condition of destabilization and low visibility, which could affect the landing in a safe way. Thus, this selective perception, reinforced by the expectation of completing the landing at the destination, contributed to the outcome of this occurrence. - Management planning Â undetermined. All crewmembers on flight O66227 were called for the mission in accordance with the on notice roster. The calling of the copilot and the flight chief did not adhere to the established in the company's MGO; consequently, both were late to present themselves for the aircraft commander. Flight O66227 took off 30 minutes after the scheduled time. It is possible to consider that the delayed takeoff from Salvador to Rio de Janeiro had a negative influence on the assessments and the decision of the crewmembers to proceed with the execution of the landing. - Decision-making process Â a contributor. There was a compromised analysis of the information available to the crew, so that the aircraft's destabilization condition was not considered, as well as the meteorological degradation in the final approach, culminating in the decision to try to correct the aircraft until the last moment, even if unanswered, and proceed with the landing on SBGL.METAR: 20:00 UTC /  local time: SBGL 032000Z 15006KT 9999 4000NE -TSRA FEW012 BKN025 FEW027TCU FEW030CB OVC080 27/24 Q101320:18 UTC /  local time: SBGL 032018Z 08004KT 3000 +TSRA FEW012 BKN025 FEW030CB OVC090 27/25 Q101420:43 UTC /  local time: SBGL 032043Z 02008G22KT 0500 R15///// R33///// R10/1000 R28/170 0 +TSRA FEW004 BKN009 BKN020 FEW030CB 23/22 Q1016Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CENIPA Report number: A-036/CENIPA/2019 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: CENIPA  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates15-Mar-2024 19:45 ASN Updated [Source, Accident report, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Throughout the 133 nautical mile flight, the aircraft encountered a number of snow squalls, which reduced the flight visibility to approximately 3 nm. The pilot elected to continue the flight through these areas of snow squalls. As the aircraft approached Little Grand Rapids from the south, the pilot had the airport environment in sight and manoeuvred the aircraft to join a 3 nm final approach and descent for runway 36. When the aircraft was approximately 1.75 nm (3,24 km) from the threshold of runway 36, it encountered another snow squall, which reduced the flight visibility to less than 1 nm (1,85 km). The aircraft continued the descent in reduced visibility over the snow-covered frozen surface of Family Lake. At approximately 14:14, the pilot made the decision to initiate a go-around; however, as power was being applied, the aircraft collided with the frozen surface of Family Lake, 0.75 nm (1,39 km) from the threshold of runway 36. The aircraft remained upright and slid to a stop on the snow.  The pilot and passengers egressed the aircraft, and were transported to the Little Grand Rapids nursing station for evaluation. The pilot suffered minor injuries. The aircraft sustained substantial damage.

The first officer and two of the passengers were injured. The airplane was substantially damaged. The accident flight departed from Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), New Jersey, about 10:04. The captain was the pilot monitoring, and the first officer was the pilot flying. The en route portion of the flight was uneventful.  Once the airplane was in range of PQI, the flight crew received an updated airport weather report at the time, a special weather observation at 10:31. The observation indicated that the wind was from 090Â° at 5 knots, visibility was 1/2 mile in moderate snow and freezing fog, and the cloud ceiling was broken at 1,100 ft and overcast at 1,800 ft. At 11:01 a controller from the Boston Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) cleared the flight for an ILS approach to runway 1, and the crew was subsequently instructed to change to the PQI common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF); PQI did not have an air traffic control tower.  The captain made position reports during the approach and at 11:08:38 she stated that the approach was stable and that she had ""ground contact.""  At 11:09:54, the captain stated, ""runway in sight. See it?"" to which the first officer responded, ""yeah"" and ""well I got somethinÂ [that] looks like a runway up there.""  After losing sight of the runway, at 11:10:09, the captain stated, ""go missed"" twice. The first officer stated that, when he transitioned from looking at the instruments to looking outside, he expected to see the runway but saw what he described as ""white on white.""  The airplane had descended to a minimum pressure altitude of 703 ft (169 ft agl) before beginning to ascend.  The flight then positioned for a second approach to runway 1. The captain made the 1,000-ft callout at 11:27:21 and stated that the approach was stable. At 11:28:37, the enhanced ground proximity warning system announced ""minimums,"" shortly after the captain had made the 100-ft callout. About 2 seconds after the ""minimums"" annunciation, the captain called, ""runway in sight twelve oÂclock."" The first officer stated that, when he transitioned from the instruments to the outside during the second approach, he saw ""white on white"" again and blowing snow. The first officer also stated that it was difficult to comprehend what he was seeing outside the airplane because everything was covered in snow and that, before he could determine what he was seeing, the airplane touched down.  The airplane came to rest in the snow-covered grassy area between runway 1 and a parallel taxiway located about 630 ft to the right of the runway. The airplaneÂs resting location was about 3,600 ft beyond the runway threshold, about 305 ft to the right of the runway centerline, and about 230 ft from the right edge of runway. Probable Cause: The flight crewÂs decision, due to confirmation bias, to continue the descent below the decision altitude when the runway had not been positively identified.  Contributing to the accident were (1) the first officerÂs fatigue, which exacerbated his confirmation bias, and (2) the failure of CommutAir pilots who had observed the localizer misalignment to report it to the company and air traffic before the accident.METAR: 15:31 UTC / 10:31 local time: KPQI 041531Z AUTO 09005KT 1/2SM -SN FZFG BKN011 OVC018 M02/M04 A2971 RMK AO2 P0000 FZRANO RVRNO15:56 UTC / 10:56 local time: KPQI 041556Z AUTO 08006KT 1/2SM SN FZFG OVC013 M02/M04 A2970 RMK AO2 SLP103 P0001 T10221044 FZRANO RVRNO16:18 UTC / 11:18 local time: KPQI 041618Z AUTO 06004KT 1/2SM SN FZFG M03/M04 A2968 RMK AO2 P0000 FZRANO RVRNO16:43 UTC / 11:43 local time: KPQI 041643Z AUTO 07005KT 3/4SM -SN SCT008 OVC013 M01/M04 A2967 RMK AO2 P0001 FZRANO RVRNOAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA19FA089 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Flightaware   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Presque Isle International Airport, ME (PQI); 04 March 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Presque Isle International Airport, ME (PQI); 04 March 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Presque Isle International Airport, ME (PQI); 04 March 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) Charles Walters; Los Angeles International Airport, CA (LAX/KLAX); 24 January 2008 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft took off at 06:13 hours local time with a crew of three, eight passengers and 500 kgs of cargo. Adverse weather conditions were encountered en route and the crew decided divert to Miraflores (SKMF) where it landed at 07:39. There two more passengers boarded the flight for Villavicencio.  At 08:34 the aircraft took off from Miraflores and flew to San Jose del Guaviare (SKSJ) to refuel, where it landed at 09:14. The aircraft was fueled and the crew submitted a flight plan to Villavicencio with a total flight time of 45 minutes an altitude of 8,500 feet. Prior to departure one more passenger boarded the flight.  The aircraft took off at 09:55. At 10:15, when the aircraft was climbing through 8,100 feet and approximately 59NM (109 km) from Villavicencio, the flight reported engine problems and their failure to feather the propeller.  At the crew's request, ATC provided information on the location of several aerodromes in the area and the crew chose to proceed to La Rinconada aerodrome. The aircraft lost altitude and last radio contact was at 10:32 when the crew radioed that they had a runway in sight, with no further information. At 10:34 the aircraft hit the ground of a palm plantation with a high angle of descent and low speed. Flaps and undercarriage were retracted at the time of the accident. The aircraft slid across a gravel road and burst into flames. Probable Cause(s). The investigation determined that the accident was caused by the following probable causes: - Loss of control in-flight as a consequence of the decrease in minimum in-flight control speed and drag generated by the impossibility of performing the No. 1 engine propeller feathering in the face of engine failure. - Malfunction of the lubrication system of engine No. 1, evident in the abundant oil leakage from the engine, in flight, and in the governor of the left propeller; although discrepancies were found in the maintenance of the propeller feathering pressure line, it was not possible to determine the origin of the oil leakage. - Weaknesses in the aircraft Operator's operational procedures, lacking a standard that would facilitate a crew's decision making to act in the event of critical failures, in matters such as making an emergency landing on unprepared field or the selection of an alternate airfield. Contributing Factors: - Deficiencies in standard maintenance practices during repairs performed on the No. 1 engine's propeller propeller feathering oil pressure line. - Non-compliance with an effective and reliable maintenance program, which did not verify the operating conditions of the aircraft components; it was not possible to determine compliance with the last 50-hour service, Phase A, to engine No. 1 according to the company's maintenance program, since there are no records of that service in the Flight Log. - Inefficient safety management system of the Operator for not detecting errors in the maintenance processes and in the conduct and control of operations.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Aerocivil Report number: COL-19-10-GIA Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: elespectador.com  Aerocivil   Location  Images: photo (c) William Wilson; Villavicencio Airport (VVC/SKVV); 10 March 2011 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

After feeling the impact, the CRJ-900 crew aborted their engine start procedure and set the parking brake, while the CRJ-700 crew started their auxiliary power unit and shut down both engines after receiving damage reports from ATC and neighboring airplanes. An emergency evacuation was not performed on either aircraft. Post-accident examination revealed substantially damaged to the horizontal and vertical stabilizers and left elevator of the CRJ-900, and the horizontal stabilizer and left elevator of the CRJ-700.

There were no survivors among the 157 occupants. Takeoff roll began from runway 07R at 08:38 hours local time, with a flap setting of 5 degrees and a stabilizer setting of 5.6 units.  At 08:38:44, ten seconds after rotation, the left and right recorded Angle of Attack (AOA) values deviated. The left AOA decreased to 11.1Â° then increased to 35.7Â° while value of right AOA indicated 14.94Â°.  This resulted in the onset of the stick shaker followed by a master caution light. At the same time the captainÂs primary flight display (PFD) showed a drop in indicated airspeed (IAS) from 170Kt to 156Kt. The captain initially responded by reducing the pitch as a reaction to the stick shaker. This did not stop the stick shaker and the captain to stopped applying further nose down column input at a pitch angle of 7-8Â° above horizon Approaching 400 ft, the captain attempted to engage the autopilot (AP) but it was not successful. A second attempt failed as well. Passing 1000 ft radio altitude, at the third attempt, the autopilot was successfully engaged.  The captain asked the first officer to advise ATC of the inability to follow the planned departure due to a flight control problem and to request runway heading and climb 14,000ft. The left stall management yaw damper computer which was affected by inputs from a failed left AOA sensor calculated the left hand minimum operational airspeed erroneously above 340kt (VMO). This resulted in an overspeed warning. At the same time, the auto throttle operation was affected by the erroneous left AOA sensor value and remained in the Arm mode and failed to transition to N1 mode, which would have reduced the take-off thrust to climb thrust automatically.  The auto throttle did not give a warning or a failure flag for the flight crew when its operation was affected by the failed AOA sensor value. The first activation of the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) system occurred within a second where the auto throttle was supposed to reduce from take-off thrust to climb trust. And in less than another second the GPWS aural alert ""DONÂT SINK"" sounded twice. The activation of MCAS followed by GPWS aural alert with already ongoing stick shaker coupled with no failure flag or warning from the auto throttle in an extremely high workload environment must have caused the auto throttle remaining in the ARM mode with take-off thrust set to remain unnoticed by the crew.  At 08:39:45, captain requested flaps up and the first officer moved the flap handle to position 0. The autopilot then disengaged and the flaps reached the up position. At 08:40:00, because of the erroneous left AOA value, the MCAS activated the first automatic nose down trim for 9 seconds. At the end of the first MCAS activation the stabilizer position was 2.1 units with the captain pulling to pitch up the airplane, with a force of around 90 lbs (41 kg). At different times when the pilot applied electrical trim for short duration or longer duration the trim stopped at about 2.3 for unknown reasons. At 08:40:20 the second MCAS activation, lasting 7 seconds, was interrupted by the captainÂs electric trim up inputs. The captain applied a nine second electric trim-up input which fully counteracted the second MCAS input and stopped the GPWS warning but it did not bring the aircraft to a neutral trim condition. When MCAS activated for the third time an automatic nose-down trim was commanded there was no corresponding motion of the stabilizer, which is consistent with the stabilizer trim cutout switches being in the ÂcutoutÂ position. The captain repeatedly requested the first officer to pull up with him on the control column with pitch values oscillating between 7Â° nose up and -2Â° nose down. Pitch increased when both pilots applied forces, pitch decreased when a single pilot applied force (force oscillated between 80 lbs and 110 lbs (36-50 kg)). The vertical speed variations followed the variations of the pitch angle, with vertical speed was oscillating between -2,500 ft/min and 4,400 ft/min. The captain requested the first officer to try the manual trim wheel, and after seconds of intense efforts, the first officer told the captain that it was not working. This was due to the amount of force required to turn the trim wheel. At this moment the stabilizer trim was at 2.3 units with the IAS at 340 Kts. At 08:42:10 the captain asked and the first-officer to request radar control a vector to return. ATC instructed ET302 to turn right heading 260 degrees. During the radio communications with the ATC, the first officerÂs action on the control column was released which increased forces on the captainÂs control column. The captain then requested the first officer to check the Master Caution. Then, they both announced ""left alpha vane"". At this time the airplane was almost reaching the minimum safe altitude. After about 10 seconds the captain then told the first officer that they should pitch up together. The captain then told the first officer ""pitch is not enough"" and ""put them up"". A sound similar to stab trim cut-out switches being returned to normal was recorded on the CVR, thus the stab trim cut out switches were most likely turned back on at that moment. After a failed attempt to trim using the manual trim wheel as per the runaway stabilizer non-normal checklist and significant and unbearable amount of force on the control column, the flight crew were trying to find other means to relieve the force. The airplane was at 13800 ft; IAS was 367kt, pitch just below 1Â°, stabilizer at 2.3 units of trim, bank angle 21Â° right. The crew was busy pulling on the controls with high muscular force trying to maintain airplane flight path control and reach 14000 ft, a target on which they remained focused. Trying to maintain flight path control was a very demanding task and represented here a high workload, physically and mentally, to the detriment of every other task.  An overspeed warning added another disruption and disturbance on board. The cockpit noise environment was unsettling and further impacted the flight crewÂs concentration. Immediately after the stab trim cut-out switches were put back in normal position, the crew attempted another unsuccessful autopilot engagement as the plane was approaching 14000 ft. At the same time, the captain applied two brief electric trim up inputs of 1 second each while pulling on the control with an average force of 100 Lbs (45 kg). The force on the controls remained between 75 and 100 Lbs.  At 08:43:20, five seconds after the trim-up inputs, the fourth MCAS triggered. The plane started to descend. During the 9-second MCAS activation, the stabilizer decreased from 2.3 units to 1 unit of trim. The captain repeatedly shouted to the first officer to pitch up. The forces were physically unmanageable by both flight crews. The aircraft began pitching nose down.  The airplane hit the ground eighteen seconds after the end of the 4th MCAS. The investigation noted that intermittent flight control system abnormalities began well before the accident flight. Maintenance actions of relevance started occurring in December 2018 when the airplane was one month old and included several pilot write ups involving temporary fluctuations of vertical speed and altitude. There were also three reports of the airplane rolling during autopilot operation. Altitude and vertical speed indications on the PFD showed erratic and exaggerated indications.  From the maintenance log book report the airplane also suffered intermittent electrical/electronic anomalies in addition to the flight control system malfunctions. For example, three days before the crash the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) Fault Light illuminated, and the APU had a protective shutdown. The onboard maintenance function computer message also indicated the Start Converter Unit (SCU) showed the APUÂs start system was inoperative. The SCU is located in the electrical and electronics (E/E) compartment. The captainÂs personal computer power outlet also had no power. The possibility of intermittent electrical/electronic system defects were an underlying issue. The AOA sensor malfunction on the accident flight most likely occurred as the result of a power quality problem that resulted in the loss of power to the left AOA Sensor Heater. Evidence indicates the loss of power was likely due to a production related intermittent electrical/electronic failure involving the airplaneÂs Electrical Wiring Interconnection System (EWIS) and the AOA Sensor part. Probable cause of the accident Repetitive and uncommanded airplane-nose-down inputs from the MCAS due to erroneous AOA input, and its unrecoverable activation system which made the airplane dive with the rate of -33,000 ft/min close to the ground was the most probable cause of the accident. Contributing Factors 1. The MCAS design relied on a single AOA sensor, making it vulnerable to erroneous input from the sensor; 2. During the design process, Boeing failed to consider the potential for uncommanded activation of MCAS, but assumed that pilots would recognize and address it through normal use of the control column, manual electric trim, and the existing Runaway Stabilizer NNC. The OMB and Emergency AD issued after the Lion Air accident included additional guidance but did not have the intended effect of preventing another MCAS-related accident; 3. While Boeing considered the possibility of uncommanded MCAS activation as part of its FHA, it did not evaluate all the potential alerts and indications that could accompany a failure leading to an uncommanded MCAS; 4. The MCAS contribution to cumulative AOA effects was not assessed; 5. The combined effect of alerts and indications that impacted pilotÂs recognition and procedure prioritization were not evaluated by the Manufacturer; 6. Absence of AOA DISAGREE warning flag on the flight display panels (PFD); 7. The B737 MAX Crew difference CBT training prepared by Boeing and delivered to Pilots did not cover the MCAS system; 8. Failure by the manufacturer to design simulator training for pilots with regards to safety critical systems like MCAS with catastrophic consquences during undesired activation. 9. The manufacturer failed to provide procedures regarding MCAS operation to the crew during training or in the FCOM; 10. Failure by the manufacturer to address the safety critical questions raised by the airline which would have cleared out crew confusion and task prioritization.METAR: 05:00 UTC / 08:00 local time: HAAB 100500Z 06008KT 9999 FEW025 16/10 Q102906:00 UTC / 09:00 local time: HAAB 100600Z 07010KT 9999 FEW025 18/09 Q1029Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Ethiopia Report number: AI-01/19 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB Response to Final Aircraft Accident Investigation Report  BEA comments   Location  Images: photo (c) LLBG Spotter; Tel Aviv-Ben Gurion International Airport (TLV/LLBG); 08 February 2019; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) David Rubinstein; Nairobi-Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (NBO/HKJK); 22 December 2018 photo (c) David Rubinstein; near Addis Ababa; 22 December 2018 photo (c) Jean-Paul Coupin; Beirut-Rafic Hariri International Airport (BEY/OLBA); 04 February 2019 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

After completing an uneventful landing on sea ice near Tuktoyaktuk for scientific research, they flew the aircraft to Pelly Island located 50 miles to the West. The crew first completed two reconnaissance patterns above the sea ice surface to assess wind and surface conditions. The crew then conducted a final pass and chose an into-wind approach for landing on the sea ice, approximately 1 nautical mile from the island. The aircraft touched down on a smooth area of sea ice but then bounced into the air after contacting a drift perpendicular to the aircraftÂs heading. The aircraft impacted the base of a larger drift once it settled back onto the sea ice. The nose landing gear collapsed and the aircraft came to a stop shortly thereafter. The aircraft sustained very serious damage, with damage to multiple major components as a result of the impact with the snow drifts. No personnel were injured in the accident and all were subsequently evacuated to Inuvik, NT by civilian helicopter. The investigation concluded that the crew did not see the drifts during the two reconnaissance patterns, during the final pass, nor when on approach for landing. The high cirrus cloud layer that obscured the sun contributed to the difficulty in assessing the sea ice surface.Sources: CBC  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

The two pilots and two passengers were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and an instrument flight rules flight plan was filed for the flight that originated from Harrisburg-Capital City Airport, Pennsylvania, and was destined for Monongahela-Rostraver Airport, Pennsylvania.  According to the pilot, the airplane was on approach to Monongahela when he lowered the landing gear handle and heard a crunching noise. He noticed there were no green cockpit indicator lights to confirm that the landing gear was down and locked. The pilot then asked the co-pilot to circle the airport while he looked up the emergency procedures for extending the landing gear in the airplane flight manual. He tried to extend the landing gear manually, but it appeared to be jammed. The pilot and co-pilot discussed the situation and decided to fly to Arnold Palmer Regional Airport (LBE), Latrobe, Pennsylvania since the airport had a control tower and emergency equipment. The pilot flew by the tower and asked if tower personnel could see the landing gear down. The tower controller told him that the landing gear appeared to be down. During the subsequent landing roll , the left main landing gear collapsed, followed shortly by the right main landing gear. The airplane then slid to a stop on the centerline of the runway and the flight crew and passengers egressed the airplane. Examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed that the main landing gear mechanical linkage was compromised, and the right main landing gear actuator shaft was broken. The actuator was retained for further examination.

Both pilots sustained fatal injuries.  The two commercial pilots were conducting a personal, cross-country flight. As the airplane approached the approach end of the landing runway, it began to climb, rolled left, became inverted, and then impacted terrain. The left thrust reverser (T/R) was found open and unlatched at the accident site. An asymmetric deployment of the left T/R would have resulted in a left roll/yaw. The lack of an airworthy and operable cockpit voice recorder, which was required for the flight, precluded identifying which pilot was performing pilot flying duties, as well as other crew actions and background noises, that would have facilitated the investigation. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that it was not equipped, nor was required to be equipped, with a nose landing gear ground contact switch intended to preclude inflight operation of the thrust reverser. Further, electrical testing of the T/R left and right stow microswitches within the cockpit throttle quadrant revealed that the left stow microswitch did not operate within design specifications. Disassembly of the left and right stow microswitches revealed evidence of arc wear due to aging. Based on this information, it is likely that the airplaneÂs lack of an NLG ground contact switch and the age-related failure of the stow microswitches resulted in an asymmetric T/R deployment while on approach and a subsequent loss of airplane control. Also, there were additional T/R system components that were found to unairworthy that would have affected the control of the T/R system. Cause: The airplaneÂs unairworthy thrust reverser (T/R) system due to inadequate maintenance that resulted in an asymmetric T/R deployment during an approach to the airport and the subsequent loss of airplane control.METAR: 20:05 UTC / 15:05 local time: KHSD 182005Z AUTO 00000KT 10SM CLR 19/M02 A3026 RMK A0120:25 UTC / 15:25 local time: KHSD 182025Z AUTO 18007KT 10SM CLR 20/M02 A3025 RMK A0120:45 UTC / 15:45 local time: KHSD 182045Z AUTO VRB03KT 10SM CLR 20/M02 A3025 RMK A01Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN19FA104 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: kxii.com   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Oklahoma City-Sundance Airport, OK (HSD); 18 March 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Oklahoma City-Sundance Airport, OK (HSD); 18 March 2019; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

When 9M-TST approach closer on its final approach, the leader of the contractor's worker saw the landing light of the aircraft approaching and realised that there was an aircraft coming in for a landing. All three workers boarded their vehicle and drove away from the runway. While making a 180 degrees turn, the driver realised the escorting vehicle was still static on the runway. They flashed the headlight of the vehicle several times to attract the escort vehicle attention. No response was observed from the escort vehicle, and as the aircraft was getting closer to them, the driver drove his vehicle away from the runway and stopped at taxiway Foxtrot to give way for the aircraft to land. After the aircraft had landed safely, while decelerating with a speed between 90 to 100 knots, the aircraft hit the stationary car. Probable Cause: Incorrect information of vehicle activities on the runway handed over to the taking over controller led to the landing clearance given without realising the runway is occupied.METAR: 19:00 UTC / 03:00 local time: WMSA 171900Z VRB03KT 7000 FEW025 BKN270 27/23 Q101120:00 UTC / 04:00 local time: WMSA 172000Z 00000KT 7000 FEW025 BKN280 27/23 Q1011Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Malaysia Report number: A 02/19 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: New Straits Times   Location  Images: photo (c) Alvin Tan Chun San; Bintulu Airport (BTU/WBGB); 17 September 2014 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Consequently, the main undercarriage could not be lowered. Even manual attempts to deploy the undercarriage using an emergency procedure proved fruitless due to a technical failure (seizing) on the landing gear door up-lock mechanisms. The flight crew then performed a main gear-up landing at Tehran-Mehrabad Airport, Iran. There were no injuries and there was no fire. Investigation results show that the aircraft had suffered hydraulical issues on prior flights.  Causes: The aircraft involved accident due to the main gear up landing on the runway. The Aircraft Accident Investigation Board (AAIB) determines that the accident took place due to a combination of failures in hydraulic system and L/G manual extension. The investigation revealed that the contributive factors in human failures were as: - Not following procedures - Ineffective maintenance - Pilot nonstandard action to HYD #1 pump fault light based on QRH on previous flight IRA.214Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Iran Report number: A971228EPIDG Status: Investigation completedDuration: 12 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: CAO Iran   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

After connecting the ground power unit (GPU) to the aircraft by the mechanic, the ramp assistant removed the tractor from the GPU, switched it on and drove away. Turning left he saw the mechanic standing close to the nose of the aircraft and being unable to stop the tractor he hit him, lost the control of the tractor, turning again to the left and hitting at this time the forward right side of the fuselage near the socket causing a serious rupture. Without delay the flight crew shut down engine no.2 and as a safety measure they switched off all systems in the aircraft.

The nosewheel steering bypass pin had been installed and the TLD 200MT lift tug was aligned with the aircraft nose landing gear main forging. The tug was being driven by a driver undergoing his first pushback in this model and type of tug, under the direct supervision of a trainer seated alongside in the cab. The tug was being brought forward using its laser guidance system and joystick and was at the point where the 'paddles' close around the nosewheels. Whilst this was taking place the trainer observed movement of the nose gear followed by a bang. The driver immediately stopped the procedure, the brakes were applied, and the trainer and driver exited the cab to investigate the cause of the bang. On inspection they found that the paddle on the left side of the aircraft had contacted, and damaged, the nut on the torque link centre pivot. There also was a significant witness mark on the paddle. They then informed the aircraft commander and the aircraft maintenance company. The scheduled flight was cancelled, and the aircraft taken out of service. There were no injuries reported by the passengers or the crews of the aircraft and tug. It is not clear why the event occurred. The handling company confirmed that the training and knowledge of the requirement to align with the nosewheels was in place. However,  in this case it is possible that a momentary lapse in concentration led to the system being aligned to the nose leg rather than the nose wheels. This error is likely to have gone unnoticed because the 10Â° to 15Â° offset of the nosewheels was not significant enough to indicate a problem.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: EW/G2019/03/11 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: AAIB  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates15-Mar-2024 20:37 ASN Updated [Source, Accident report, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Foehn conditions were already foreseeable at Innsbruck, but wind shears were not forecast. The en route and descent part of the flight were uneventful.

Five minutes later the aircraft was on final approach at 30 ft above the ground at a speed (IAS) of about 141 kt. During the next two seconds, the aircraft quickly lost altitude and speed. The first officer noticed that the aircraft was ""pushed down"". The rate of descent was approximately 500-700 ft/min. The first officer increased the power, but at this point the aircraft was already touching down on the runway at a speed of 123 knots.  The first officer pulled up the nose of the aircraft, because of which the pitch angle of the aircraft rose to 7.65Â° when touching down. The rate of descent decreased to approximately 200-500 ft/min by the time of touchdown. The maximum vertical acceleration (along the yaw axis) when touching down was 2.1 g.  A post-landing inspection showed damage to the underside of the rear fuselage, which had touched the runway. On the inside of the rear of the fuselage, stringers and frames were broken and bent.

Kennedy International Airport, NY (JFK/KJFK)","Los Angeles International Airport, CA (LAX/KLAX)"," NTSB","Accident investigation report completed and information captured","American Airlines flight 300, an Airbus A321, experienced a left roll during takeoff from runway 31L at New York's JFK Airport.  During the left roll, the airplaneÂs left wingtip struck the ground and a runway distance marker on the left side of the runway. The flight crew completed the takeoff and safely returned to the airport 28 minutes later.  The wind at the time resulted in a 14- to 17-knot crosswind from the right, which was below the companyÂs 35-knot crosswind limitation. The initial takeoff roll proceeded normally, with the captain (the pilot flying) applying left rudder pedal to counter the right crosswind. The captain stated that he kept the airplane near the runway centerline and that ""everything was ok"" when the airplane reached 80 knots. When the airplane reached the rotation speed of 156 knots while still on the ground, the captain made a large left rudder pedal input, from 8Â° to 25Â°, during a 1.5-second timeframe. In response to this large rudder pedal input, the airplaneÂs heading deviated to the left, and its lateral acceleration increased to a maximum of 0.32 G. During a postaccident interview, the captain stated the airplane made a ""significant"" turn to the left. The captain also stated that he was ""looking at the runway edge"" and knew he had to get the airplane into the air. Digital flight data recorder (DFDR) data showed that the sidestick was pulled to its full nose-up position and a right sidestick position. During the aft sidestick and right sidestick application to rotate the airplane, the rudder remained close to its full-left deflection for 3 seconds. As the nose of the airplane lifted off the ground, the airplane began to roll to the left, and the left roll rate accelerated as the main landing gear lifted off the ground, reaching a maximum of 37Â° left wing down as the captain moved the rudder and sidestick to full right and to full aft. These movements arrested the left roll and allowed the airplane to continue to lift off. The large left roll angle immediately after liftoff resulted in the left wingtip striking the ground and a runway distance marker, part of which remained imbedded in the wingtip.  No airplane flight control abnormalities were noted, except for a left aileron deflection as the left wingtip scraped the ground. Thus, the left roll that occurred was in response to the captainÂs left rudder pedal input during rotation of the airplane. Probable cause: The captainÂs excessive left rudder pedal input during the takeoff ground roll, which caused a large heading deviation and a left roll upon rotation that resulted in the left wingtip striking the ground.METAR: 00:51 UTC / 20:51 local time: KJFK 110051Z 36017KT 10SM SCT250 10/M03 A2998 RMK AO2 SLP153 T01001028 23:51 UTC / 21:51 local time: KJFK 102351Z 33015KT 10SM FEW070 FEW250 11/M03 A2996 RMK AO2 PK WND 34026/2257 SLP145 T01111028 10161 20111 53034Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA19LA134 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Flightaware track  ABC7NY   Location  Images: photo (c) Seat 16A; New York-John F.

The aircraft was bound for Hamilton-Marion County Airport (HAB), Alabama. At 15:06 the flight reported climbing through 1300 ft. ATC notified the flight of moderate to severe precipitation in the area of UOX and provided a clearance to 11000 ft MSL. At 15:08 ATC queried the flight for their altitude and informed the flight of moderate to heavy precipitation along their route of flight. The flight acknowledged the radio call and informed ATC they were climbing through 9000 ft for 11000 ft. About 15:12 ATC queried the flight if they were having navigation issues or if they were deviating. The flight responded they were deviating and that they were having ""AC voltage problems."" The last radio call received from the flight was an acknowledgement of a heading assignment to 095 at 15:13. The airplane disappeared from radar about 30 seconds later and the ATC controller tried unsuccessfully to raise the flight on the radio at that time. Preliminary radar data began tracking the airplane at 15:06. The airplane transponder stopped transmitting Mode 3A information about 15:08, so no altitude information was available for the remainder of the flight. The airplane maintained an approximate heading of 080 from 15:06 until about 15:10. At 15:10 the airplane turned right to about 120 heading. At 15:12 the airplane made a left turn to about 040 heading. At 15:13 the airplane began a right turn that continued to a heading of about 270 until radar contact was lost at 15:13:26. The final radar return was about .5 miles southeast of the accident location.

The aircraft and helicopter were destroyed. One helicopter (Shree Airlines Eurocopter AS 350, 9N-ALK) sustained minor damage.  The copilot of the Summit Air plane sustained fatal injuries. Two persons on the ground at the helipad also died in the accident. The L-410 was repositioning to Ramechhap after flying passengers and cargo to Lukla. The captain taxied the aircraft to threshold of runway 24 and handed over control to the co-pilot. Within 3 seconds of the takeoff roll the aircraft veered to the right and exited the runway, travelling about 43 ft across the grassy part on right side of runway 24, before striking the airport inner perimeter fence. It then continued to skid for about 43 ft, and hit two persons before it crashed into the upper helipad. It struck the turning rotor blades of 9N-ALC. The moving rotors cut through the cockpit and the helicopter toppled onto the lower helipad 6 ft below. The left-hand  wing of the aircraft broke the skid of another helicopter, 9N-ALK, and came to a halt with 9N-ALC beneath its right-hand  main wheel assembly Lukla Airport is located on a mountain at an elevation of 9334 feet (2845 m). The runway is 1729 ft long (527 m) with an 11.7% gradient. Takeoffs must be performed from the downsloping runway 24. The helipad is located to the right of the runway, about 100 meters past the threshold. Probable Cause The commission concluded that the probable cause of the accident was aircraft's veering towards right during initial take-off roll as a result of asymmetric power due to abrupt shifting of right power lever rearwards and failure to abort the takeoff by crew. There were not enough evidences to determine the exact reason for abrupt shifting of the power lever. Contributing Factors 1. Failure of the PF(being a less experienced co-pilot) to immediately assess and act upon the abrupt shifting of the right power lever resulted in aircraft veering to the right causing certain time lapse for PIC to take controls in order to initiate correction. 2. PIC's attempted corrections of adding power could not correct the veering. Subsequently, application of brakes resulted in asymmetric braking due to the position of the pedals, and further contributed veering towards right.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Nepal AAIC Report number: AAIR-076/1 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Kathmandu Post   Location  Images: photo (c) Nepal AAIC; Lukla-Tenzing-Hillary Airport (LUA/VNLK); 14 April 2019 photo (c) Nepal AAIC; Lukla-Tenzing-Hillary Airport (LUA/VNLK); 14 April 2019 photo (c) Nepal AAIC; Lukla-Tenzing-Hillary Airport (LUA/VNLK); 14 April 2019 photo (c) David Russell; Kathmandu-Tribhuvan Airport (KTM/VNKT); 14 October 2018 photo (c) Oleg Belaychuk; Lukla-Tenzing-Hillary Airport (LUA/VNLK); 05 November 2018 photo (c) Oleg Belaychuk; Lukla-Tenzing-Hillary Airport (LUA/VNLK); 05 November 2018 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The torque tube assembly of the aircraft's controls had been wrongly installed, causing a flight control reversal.  The aircraft departed SchÃ¶nefeld Airport on a Functional Check Flight and the flight crew soon noticed flight control problems. The aircraft entered steep turns and was exposed to forces of up to +5G. The crew managed to return to SchÃ¶nefeld Airport where an emergency landing was carried out.  In September 2019 it was announced that the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. The Global 5000 accident, that took place at Berlin-SchÃ¶nefeld on April 16, 2019, was the result of a series of omissions and errors that originated in different core areas, and involved many people either directly or indirectly. The technical error that occurred during the installation and adjustment procedure of the RCIMs [Roll Control Input-Modules] represents the event triggering the accident. The system design further enabled this failure, which allowed the RCIMs to be installed and adjusted in such a manner that the MFS [multi-function spoilers] functioned opposite of the corresponding input, and generated no error messages on the EICAS or the PMAT. Since the maintenance crew relied solely upon the EICAS warnings and the results given by the PMAT, the error remained undetected in the tests following the installation.Sources: Bundeswehr-Jet wird nach Bruchlandung vom April ausgemustert (focus.de, 4-9-2019)  Totalschaden am Kanzlerjet (spiegel.de, 3-9-2019)  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

A captain in training assumed the role of pilot-in-command (PIC) and Piot Flying while the line indoctrination captain acted as first officer (FO) and Pilot Monitoring on the flight. The FO conducted a pre-flight inspection of the aircraft and noted that the aircraft had about 1600 pounds of fuel on board. Because he preferred to order fuel directly from a fuel technician, he went to the fuel office in the hangar, but could not find anyone to take the fuel order. Intending to return to the office later, he went to the lounge where he found out that the flight would be delayed pending the arrival of the 2nd flight nurse. When the captain asked if the aircraft was ready for the flight, the FO replied that it was. When preparing for departure, the flight crew completed the BEFORE START checklist. The last step on the checklist was to start the engine. The flight crew then taxied to a run-up area and began the AFTER START checklist. When the FO read out the checklist item FUEL QUANTITY, the captain responded with the text that was printed on the checklist, ""SUFFICIENT/BALANCED,"" but he did not check the fuel quantity indicators. When the checklist was complete, the crew taxied to the runway. The aircraft departed CYWG at 16:39. Roughly 8 NM after the takeoff, while still in the climb, the captain performed a progressive fuel calculation. He did not look at the fuel quantity indicators during the process. The aircraft continued the climb and levelled off at flight level (FL) 250. During the rest of the flight, neither pilot performed periodic scans of the fuel quantity indicators. At 18:13, when the aircraft was about 14 NM west-northwest of Gillam Airport (CYGX) and still level at FL 250, the left fuel pressure (L FUEL PRESS) warning light illuminated, indicating low fuel. The warning was followed almost immediately by power surging in the left engine. The captain turned the boost pump ON, and noticed that the fuel quantity indicators were showing 0 pounds. The captain asked the FO about the fuel quantity, at which point the FO realized that he had forgotten to order fuel. The flight crew declared an emergency with the Winnipeg Area Control Centre (ACC) at 18:14 and began an emergency descent. The weather conditions at CYYQ were marginal, so the decision was made to divert to the alternate aerodrome, CYGX; however, the aircraft continued on the same heading toward CYYQ for another 2 minutes By 18:15, when the aircraft was at FL 220, the left engine had exhausted its fuel supply and lost power. The crew conducted the emergency engine shutdown procedure in the Emergency and Abnormal Procedures Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) to shut down the engine; however, the left propeller continued to windmill at speeds between 1300 and 2000 rpm throughout the ensuing descent. At 18:15:32, the FO programmed the FMS to display a track to CYGX and instructed the captain to turn right and follow the track. The FO moved the heading bugs, which were coupled on both FMS displays, to the CYGX heading. The captain then initiated a right turn toward CYGX. The captain reduced the power setting of the right engine. From 18:15 to 18:18, the rate of descent varied between 3000 and 6000 fpm. The crew extended the landing gear in an attempt to set up a suitable descent angle to Runway 23. At 18:17, the flight crew informed the ACC that the nature of the emergency was fuel related. The ACC provided the flight crew with the weather at CYGX and informed them that emergency services at CYGX would be notified. As the aircraft descended through approximately 5000 feet above sea level (ASL), the FO obtained a vertical navigation (VNAV) profile to Runway 23 on the FMS. The crew retracted the landing gear as the aircraft intercepted the VNAV path.  By 18:20, the airspeed had decayed to approximately 100 knots and the captain was having difficulty controlling the aircraft. At times, the aircraft was descending below the VNAV path. Seeing this, the FO took over control and assumed the Pilot Flying duties. At 18:21, as the aircraft descended through 2800 feet ASL, the left propeller ceased windmilling as the rpm decreased from 1300 to 0 rpm. The flight crew made a Mayday call at 18:21:30 on the CYGX mandatory frequency. When the aircraft was at approximately 2000 feet ASL, it descended below the cloud base and the FO was able to visually identify CYGX. At 18:22:34, when the aircraft was at 1300 feet ASL, roughly 835 feet above ground level (AGL), the right engine lost power. The aircraft could no longer maintain the VNAV path or a suitable visual approach to the runway. When the aircraft was at about 530 feet AGL and 1 NM from the runway, the crew shut down and feathered the right engine while continuing the right-hand curving visual approach to Runway 23. The flaps remained up throughout the approach and subsequent landing. The crew selected the landing gear DOWN when the aircraft was at about 50 feet AGL and the aircraft touched down on the frozen surface of Stephens Lake with the landing gear fully extended. Sufficient airspeed remained to enable the FO to raise the nose as the aircraft approached the rocky shoreline at the approach end of Runway 23. The aircraft struck the rocky shoreline in a nose-high attitude and skidded up onto the right edge of the runway area, coming to rest approximately 190 feet before the threshold . Findings as to causes and contributing factors 1. When the captain asked if the aircraft was ready for the flight, the first officer replied that it was, not recalling that the aircraft required fuel. 2. While performing the FUEL QUANTITY item on the AFTER START checklist, the captain responded to the first officerÂs prompt with the rote response that the fuel was sufficient, without looking at the fuel gauges. 3. The aircraft departed Winnipeg/James Armstrong Richardson International Airport with insufficient fuel on board to complete the planned flight. 4. The flight crew did not detect that there was insufficient fuel because the gauges had not been included in the periodic cockpit scans. 5. When the flight crew performed the progressive fuel calculation, they did not confirm the results against the fuel gauges, and therefore their attention was not drawn to the low-fuel state at a point that would have allowed for a safe landing. 6. Still feeling the effect of the startle response to the fuel emergency, the captain quickly became task saturated, which led to an uncoordinated response by the flight crew, delaying the turn toward Gillam Airport, and extending the approach. 7. The right engine lost power due to fuel exhaustion when the aircraft was 1 nautical mile from Runway 23. From that position, a successful forced landing on the intended runway was no longer possible and, as a result, the aircraft touched down on the ice surface of Stephens Lake, short of the runway.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A19C0038 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: CTV News  Winnipeg Sun  TSB   Location  Images: photo (c) RCMP; Gillam Airport, MB (YGX); 24 April 2019 photo (c) TSB Canada; Gillam Airport, MB (YGX); 24 April 2019 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

It was a training flight to acquire the type rating for the aircraft. The right pilot's seat was occupied by the pilot in command, who was deployed on this flight as a flight instructor. The student pilot, as co-pilot, sat on the left pilot seat and was the pilot flying. For the co-pilot it was the second flight day of his practical training program on the Cessna 551 Citation II/SP. The day before, he had already completed about three flying hours on the plane. At Siegerland Airport, three precision approaches to runway 31 were carried out with the help of the Instrument Landing System (ILS). After the third landing, the tower, due to the changed wind, turned the landing direction to runway 13. The cockpit crew therefore rolled the aircraft to the end of the runway, turned and took off at 14:34 from runway 13. This was followed by a left-hand circuit at an altitude of 3,500 ft AMSL. The approach to runway 13 took place under visual flight conditions. According to both pilots, the checklists were processed during the circuit and the aircraft was prepared for landing on runway 13. In the final approach, the landing configuration was then established and the landing checklist performed. The copilot reported that shortly before the landing the speed decreased, the aircraft flew too low and the approach angle had to be corrected. He pushed the engine thrust levers forward to the stop. The pilot in command supported this action by also pushing the engine thrust levers forward with his hand. However, according to the pilot in command, the remaining time to touch down on the runway was no longer sufficient for the engines to accelerate to maximum speed in order to deliver the corresponding thrust. He also described that the aircraft had been in the stall area at that time. However, he had not noticed a stall warning. At 14:42, with the landing gear extended, the aircraft touched down in the grass in front of the asphalt area of runway 13. The left main landing gear buckled and damaged the tank of the left wing. The right main landing gear also buckled, the tank on the right side remained undamaged. The kerosene escaping from the left wing ignited and a fire broke out. The aircraft burned and slipped along runway 13 on the folded landing gear, the underside of the airframe and the extended landing flaps until it came to a standstill after a distance of approx. 730 m from runway threshold 13. After the plane had come to a standstill on the runway, the copilot noticed flames on the left side of the plane. The pilot switched off both engines. Then both pilots left the plane via the emergency exit door on the right side. The pilots were not injured. Conclusions: The accident, in which the aircraft touched down in front of the runway threshold, was due to an unstabilized approach and failure to initiate a go around maneuver. The following factors contributed to the accident: - The formation of the aerodrome circuit was too close to the airfield. - The final approach was flown too short and performed in a manner that resulted in an unstabilized approach. - During the final approach, the approach angle was not maintained correctly to the runway threshold. - The airspeed on final approach was too low. - Both pilots had not recognized the speed drop early enough and had not increased the engine power in time. - The flight instructor had intervened too late and thus the aircraft attitude was not brought under control in time. An additional contributing factor was the rising terrain ahead of the runway threshold. The student pilot most likely had the impression of being too high and deliberately kept the approach angle flat.METAR: 11:20 UTC / 13:20 local time: EDGS 241120Z 22006KT 110V240 9999 FEW048 19/07 Q100312:20 UTC / 14:20 local time: EDGS 241220Z 22006KT 100V240 CAVOK 21/08 Q100313:20 UTC / 15:20 local time: EDGS 241320Z 15007KT 110V200 CAVOK 20/08 Q1002Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BFU Report number: BFU19-0411-3X Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Fahrwerk beim Landeanflug abgerissen: Kleiner Jet fÃ¤ngt am Siegerland-Flughafen Feuer (wa.de, 24-4-2019)  Video Â Cessna geht nach Bruchlandung in Flammen auf (wirsiegen.de, 24-4-2019)  Flightradar24 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  5 October 2008 D-IADV Advance Air (AXX) 0 Sylt Airport (GWT/EDXW) sub Location  Images: photo (c) Alec Wilson; Birmingham International Airport (BHX/EGBB); 24 May 2013; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The reported Runway Visual Range (RVR) was 300 to 325 m. EI-SEV arrived from Stansted Airport (STN) and landed on runway 27 before following taxiway Alpha eastwards to the Central Apron.

After departure, while the aircraft was climbing through 1200 feet above sea level on the way to a cruising altitude of 5000 feet, the flight crew completed the after-takeoff checklist and applied carburetor heat to 20 Â°C. While the First Officer (FO) was applying the carburetor heat, oil pressure was observed decreasing on the left engine (Pratt & Whitney R-1830-92). Moments later, rising cylinder head temperature and oil temperature indications were also observed on the left engine. The captain directed the FO to contact the area control centre to declare a PAN PAN emergency and request a return to CYHY, which the FO then did. The aircraft flight manual (AFM) does not contain any procedures for abnormal engine indications. As the aircraft reached an altitude of 1969 feet, the captain set the left engine to a reduced power setting and increased the power on the right engine to maximum except takeoff (METO) power. The flight crew began to set up for an instrument landing system approach to CYHY via TANPO. At 07:47, while the aircraft was in a right turn proceeding towards TANPO, smoke and oil were observed, and abnormal sounds were heard coming from the left engine. Using the engine failure checklist, the flight crew then shut down the left engine and feathered the propeller. At 07:48, because the situation had escalated, a MAYDAY emergency was declared. Moments later, the flight crew completed the descent checklist and initiated the approach checklist. However, due to the escalating emergency, the flight crew was not able to complete the approach checklist, which included the landing briefing. At 07:53, the aircraft levelled off at 1214 feet. The FO observed zero hydraulic pressure on the landing gear DOWN gauge. Thinking this zero pressure was an issue, he mentioned it to the captain, who then directed the FO to ""prep the gear."" The FO extended the landing gear, which the captain did not expect because the aircraft had not started its final approach and the airport had not been visually acquired. At 07:55, as the aircraft continued towards TANPO, the altitude was between 1200 and 1300 feet ASL, and the airspeed was maintained at approximately 100 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS). When the aircraft was abeam TANPO, the captain began a right turn to intercept the localizer for the final approach. The aircraftÂs airspeed decreased from 100 KIAS to 80 KIAS, while its altitude decreased to 1100 feet ASL. With the reduced airspeed, the aircraftÂs flight control response became sluggish and the captain directed the landing gear to be raised. After the landing gear was raised, at 07:59, the flight crew heard abnormal sounds and felt vibrations from the right engine. The aircraftÂs airspeed was 80 KIAS, and its altitude began to decrease to below 800 feet ASL.   In an attempt to maintain altitude, the right engine was increased to maximum takeoff power, but this had no effect. The flight crew then prepared for an emergency gear-up landing, and the aircraftÂs flaps were lowered on short final to reduce speed for touchdown. At 08:01, the aircraft landed in muskeg on KÂatlÂOdeeche First Nation land, approximately 3.5 nautical miles southeast of CYHY. After the aircraft came to a stop, the FO exited the aircraft through the right-hand crew window, while the captain remained in the cockpit to secure the right engine and aircraft systems before evacuating via the forward door. The FO contacted the flight information centre to notify them of the crewÂs status and aircraft location. The emergency locator transmitter had not activated during the forced landing, so the FO activated it manually to assist search and rescue in locating the aircraft. The flight crew was uninjured. The aircraft received substantial damage. There was no post-impact fire. First responders arrived at the accident site at 11:14 In this occurrence, the aircraftÂs airspeed and altitude could not be maintained, primarily because of the increased drag when the landing gear was extended early in the approach.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A19W0052 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: cabinradio.ca  cbc.ca   Location  Images: photo (c) TSB Canada; near Hay River Airport, NT (YHY); May 2019; (CC:by-nc-nd) photo (c) TSB Canada; near Hay River Airport, NT (YHY); May 2019; (CC:by-nc-nd) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane came to rest in the shallow waters of St. Johns River, sustaining substantial damage. The 143 passengers and crew survived. The aircraft was engaged in a charter flight to bring military personnel and family members home. The No. 1 (left) thrust reverser was not operational and deferred for the flight in accordance with the airplaneÂs minimum equipment list. The captain was the pilot flying for the accident flight, and the first officer was the pilot monitoring. The captain was also performing check airman duties for the first officer who was in the process of completing operating experience training. Flight 293 departed GuantÃ¡namo Bay at 23:19 UTC. At 21:22 local time the pilot checked in with a Jacksonville approach (JAX) controller while level at 13,000 ft mean sea level and was provided the JAX altimeter setting; the controller advised the pilot to expect the RNAV runway 28 approach and moderate-to-heavy precipitation on the final approach to runway 28 (9000 ft/2743 m long). At 21:23, the JAX controller advised the pilot that the winds at KNIP were from 350Â° at 4 knots; the pilot then asked if there was any chance of getting runway 10 because it looked a little better. The JAX controller responded that he was showing moderate-to-heavy precipitation building over runway 10 starting about 5 miles on final. The pilot acknowledged and said he would stick with runway 28.  He was then instructed to descend and maintain 5,000 ft. At 21:25, the controller provided additional weather information to the flight crew, stating that moderate-to-heavy precipitation was present east and west of the airport. The pilot elected to continue for an approach to runway 28. At 21:30, the JAX controller advised the pilot that the flight was heading northbound and the precipitation was moving eastbound; the controller then asked the pilot if he would like to try runway 10 since it might be better. The pilot acknowledged ""yeah go ahead, letÂs do it."" The controller then instructed the pilot to turn left to a heading of 270Â°, and the pilot acknowledged.   Over the next several minutes, the flight was vectored for the approach to runway 10. At 21:37, the JAX controller cleared the flight for the RNAV runway 10 approach, and the pilot acknowledged.  Shortly after, the flight was transferred to the KNIP radar controller. The pilot contacted the KNIP radar controller, and, at 21:39, the KNIP radar controller indicated the winds were from 240Â° at 10 knots; he then cleared the flight to land on runway 10.  As the airplane descended through 1,390 ft mean sea level (msl), the pilots configured it for landing with the flaps set at 30Â° and the landing gear extended; however, the speedbrake handle was not placed in the armed position as specified in the Landing checklist. At an altitude of about 1,100 ft msl and 2.8 nm from the runway, the airplane was slightly above the glidepath, and its airspeed was on target. Over the next minute, the indicated airspeed increased to 170 knots (17 knots above the target approach speed), and groundspeed reached 180 knots, including an estimated 7-knot tailwind. At an altitude of about 680 ft msl and 1.6 nm from the threshold, the airplane deviated further above the 3Â° glidepath such that the precision approach path indicator (PAPI) lights would have appeared to the flight crew as four white lights and would retain that appearance throughout the rest of the approach. Eight seconds before touchdown, multiple enhanced ground proximity warning system alerts announced ""sink rate"" as the airplaneÂs descent rate peaked at 1,580 fpm. The airplane crossed the displaced threshold 120 ft above the runway and 17 knots above the target approach speed, with a groundspeed of 180 knots and a rate of descent about 1,450 ft per minute (fpm). The airplane touched down about 1,580 ft beyond the displaced threshold, which was 80 ft beyond the designated touchdown zone as specified in the operatorÂs standard operating procedures (SOP). After touchdown, the captain deployed the No. 2 engine thrust reverser and began braking; he later reported, however, that he did not feel the aircraft decelerate and increased the brake pressure. The speedbrakes deployed about 4 seconds after touchdown, most likely triggered by the movement of the right throttle into the idle reverse thrust detent after main gear tire spinup. The automatic deployment of the speedbrakes was likely delayed by about 3 seconds compared to the automatic deployment that could have been obtained by arming the speedbrakes before landing. The airplane crossed the end of the runway about 55 ft right of the centerline and impacted a seawall 90 ft to the right of the centerline, 9,170 ft beyond the displaced threshold, and 1,164 ft beyond the departure end of runway 10. After the airplane came to rest in St. Johns River, the flight crew began an emergency evacuation. The airplane was mostly intact, but both main landing gear had separated from the airplane and were also located in the river. Probable Cause and Findings An extreme loss of braking friction due to heavy rain and the water depth on the ungrooved runway, which resulted in viscous hydroplaning. Contributing to the accident was the operatorÂs inadequate guidance for evaluating runway braking conditions and conducting en route landing distance assessments. Contributing to the continuation of an unstabilized approach were 1) the captainÂs plan continuation bias and increased workload due to the weather and performing check airman duties and 2) the first officerÂs lack of experience.METAR: 01:05 UTC / 21:05 local time: KNIP 040105Z COR 08003KT 10SM -TSRA SCT008 BKN030CB BKN045 BKN250 25/23 A2997 RMK AO2 TSB04 OCNL LTGIC VC W TS W MOV E T1 SET P0000 T02500228 $01:22 UTC / 21:22 local time: KNIP 040122Z 35004KT 5SM +TSRA BR SCT008 BKN018CB OVC030 24/22 A2998 RMK AO2 TSB04 FRQ LTGIC OHD TS OHD MOV E T1 SET P0010 T02440222 $01:45 UTC / 21:45 local time: KNIP 040145Z 29008G16KT 3SM +TSRA BR SCT008 BKN015CB OVC032 24/22 A2999 RMK AO2 TSB04 FRQ LTGIC OHD TS OHD MOV E T1 SET P0063 T02440222 $01:53 UTC / 21:53 local time: KNIP 040153Z 13003KT 2SM +TSRA BR SCT010 BKN021CB OVC035 23/21 A2998 RMK AO2 TSB04 SLP149 FRQ LTGIC OHD TS OHD MOV E T1 SET P0074 T02280206 $Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA19FA143 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Flightaware track  NTSB History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  27 September 2012 N732MA Miami Air International 0 Concord Regional Airport, NC (KJQF) non Taxiway excursion Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Jacksonville Naval Air Station, FL (NIP); 04 May 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Jacksonville Naval Air Station, FL (NIP); 04 May 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Jacksonville Naval Air Station, FL (NIP); May 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Jacksonville Naval Air Station, FL (NIP); May 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Jacksonville Naval Air Station, FL (NIP); May 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) Jaime Escobar Corradine; Miami International Airport, FL (MIA/KMIA); 14 January 2011 photo (c) Victor Vu; Columbia Regional Airport, MO (COU/KCOU); 18 November 2016 photo (c) Harro Ranter/ASN; Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS/EHAM); 30 August 2016 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft was chartered to fly passengers from Monterrey to Las Vegas to visit a boxing match. At 14:52 hours local time (21:52 UTC) the aircraft took off from Las Vegas on the return leg to Monterrey. The planned flight time was two hours and thirty minutes. At 23:24 UTC, the flight contacted Monterrey ACC, requesting permission to climb to FL390. This was approved. Nine minutes later the aircraft entered the green zone of the weather system that was ahead. This caused an increase in turbulence with vertical acceleration values of between 1.40 and 0.68 g. The crew then requested to climb to FL410, which was the maximum certified operating altitude for the aircraft. This request was also approved by Monterrey ACC. At 23:37:00 UTC, the aircraft entered the core of the most intense part of the weather system. The turbulence began to become more severe. The aircraft became almost weightless, registering 0.04g followed immediately by a positive load of 1.52 g. The roll attitude oscillated from left to right with magnitudes up to 18 degrees. These conditions continued for the next sixteen seconds, during which time, the aircraft continued to climb on the same heading. At 23:37:18 UTC, the aircraft encountered a massive disturbance in the air mass that produced a negative vertical acceleration of -1.98 g, followed by +2.40g. This encounter lasted almost three seconds. The aircraft then encountered another massive disturbance, causing loads of -1.88g, followed by a sustained load in excess of 2.74 g. Four seconds after this encounter, the aircraft reached a right roll of 90 degrees and the altitude rapidly climbed to FL425. At this point the aircraft was out of control. At 23:37:27 UTC, the aircraft's altitude excursion peaked at FL448. At this point, the aircraft was inverted and banked sixty degrees, nose down. It began a rapid descent, while rolling wings level. At 23:37:31 UTC, the aircraft rolled inverted once again with a high rate of roll and continued to descend rapidly through FL404 in a flat spin.  It then impacted terrain at an elevation of 1088 m. Probable Cause: ""Impact with terrain with wings level, after a loss of control due to rapid climb and inversion of the aircraft caused by entry into severe atmospheric instability, inducing both engines to shut down"". Contributing Factors: - Inadvertent entry into severe atmospheric instability zone. - Not having the necessary information from the aircraft's weather radar system for undetermined reasons.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIDAIA Mexico Report number: ACCDTAFA019/2019MMMV Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: jornada.com.mx  Flightaware track log  eldiariodecoahuila.com.mx   Location  Images: photo (c) Darrell Sodergren; Teterboro Airport, NJ (TEB/KTEB); 04 January 2014 photo (c) Darrell Sodergren; London-Luton Airport (LTN/EGGW); 20 October 2010 photo (c) Darrell Sodergren; Farnborough Airport (FAB/EGLF); 06 March 2013 photo (c) Darrell Sodergren; Opa-locka Airport, FL (OPF/KOPF); 27 November 2010 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Of the 78 persons on board, 41 did not survive. The aircraft took off from Sheremetyevo Airport's runway 24C at 18:03 hours local time on a scheduled service to Murmansk, Russia. Visibility was fine but there were some Cumulonimbus clouds near the airfield at 6000 feet. The flight crew engaged the autopilot as the aircraft climbed through a height of 700 ft (215 m). At 18:08, as the aircraft was climbing through an altitude of about 8900 ft (2700 m), a failure occurred in the electrical system. At this point, the aircraft was 30 km west-northwest of the airport in an area of thunderstorm activity. The captain assumed manual control of the aircraft and the crew managed to establish radio contact using UHF. The flight was not able to contact the approach controller and subsequently selected the emergency transponder code 7600 (loss of radio communication). About 18:17 the aircraft overshot the runway centreline after turning to runway heading. Altitude at that time was about 2400 feet. The aircraft continued the right-hand turn, completed a circle and proceeded on the final approach for runway 24L. Flaps were selected at 25Â°, which was the recommended setting for landing above maximum landing weight. At 18:26 the flight crew selected the emergency transponder code 7700 (emergency). When descending from 335 to 275 m (1100-900 ft) the windshear warning system sounded five times: ""Go around. Windshear ahead"". From a height of 80 m (260 ft) above ground level, the aircraft descended below the glide path and at a height of 55 m (180 ft) the TAWS warning sounded: ""Glide Slope."" From that moment on the airspeed increased to 170 knots. At 18:30 the aircraft overflew the runway threshold and touched down at a distance of 900 m past the threshold at a speed of 158 knots. Touchdown occurred at a g-force of at least 2.55g with a subsequent bounce to a height of about 2 m. After two seconds the aircraft landed again on the nose landing gear with a vertical load 5.85g, and bounced to a height of 6 m. The third landing of the aircraft occurred at a speed of 140 knots with a vertical overload of at least 5g. This caused a rupture of the wing structure and fuel lines. Flames erupted and engulfed the rear of the aircraft. The aircraft slid to a stop on the grass between runway 24L and two taxiways. An emergency evacuation was then carried out while flames quickly engulfed the rear fuselage.METAR: 15:00 UTC / 18:00 local time: UUEE 051500Z 14003G08MPS 9999 FEW060CB 17/13 Q1012 R24L/290045 R24C/290045 NOSIG15:30 UTC / 18:30 local time: UUEE 051530Z 17007MPS 9999 SCT060CB 17/11 Q1012 R24L/290045 R24C/290045 NOSIG16:00 UTC / 19:00 local time: UUEE 051600Z 16004MPS 9999 -SHRA SCT055CB 16/11 Q1012 R24L/290045 R24C/290045 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number:  Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: Russian Ministry of Transport  TASS   Location  Images: photo (c) Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation; Moskva-Sheremetyevo Airport (SVO); 05 May 2019 photo (c) Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation; Moskva-Sheremetyevo Airport (SVO); 05 May 2019 photo (c) Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation; Moskva-Sheremetyevo Airport (SVO); 05 May 2019 photo (c) Flightradar24; Moskva-Sheremetyevo Airport (SVO); 05 May 2019 photo (c) Flightaware.com; Moskva-Sheremetyevo Airport (SVO); 05 May 2019 photo (c) Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation; Moskva-Sheremetyevo Airport (SVO); 05 May 2019 photo (c) Anna Zvereva; Tallinn-Ãlemiste Airport (TLL/EETN); 06 October 2017; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) Miklos Szabo; Budapest Ferenc Liszt International Airport (BUD/LHBP); 16 May 2018; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates09-Oct-2024 13:56 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft departed Dhaka-Shahjalal International Airport, Bangladesh, as Biman flight 060 about 15:15 hours local time with destination Yangon-Mingaladon Airport in Myanmar. Weather at Yangon was poor due to the presence of a thunderstorm in the area.  While the flight crew was performing an ILS approach, the controller instructed them to go around as the airport was closed due to weather. When the weather condition got better, the flight was cleared for an RNP approach to runway 21 because only the localizer was available at that moment. The co-pilot was Pilot Flying and the captain was Pilot Monitoring. The aircraft was higher than the 3 degree approach path and the airspeed fluctuated between 136 and 151 kts, which was than the 122 kts target airspeed. The captain said ""continue, continue"" to the copilot and the approach was continued. At an altitude of 22 feet over the runway, the captain began pushing the control column forward, while the PF was attempting to pull on the control column. At 1828 m down the runway, with 1585 m remaining, the aircraft briefly skipped a few times before getting airborne again. The captain then stated: ""I have control"", which was confirmed by the co-pilot. While in the air, the captain applied the brake pedal several times. At a height of 44 feet, the captain put the propellers in beta range and reduced the power lever angle to 18 degrees. The aircraft sank again and collided with runway 03 and slid forward. It left the runway and came to a complete stop in the over-run area. The aircraft fuselage broke in just behind the forward passenger door and just behind the rear service door. The undercarriage collapsed and the right hand wing broke at the attachment point with the fuselage. There was no fire. All occupants survived, but twelve suffered serious injuries. Primary Cause: While the aircraft was unstablized on approach, the pilot did not execute a go-around.METAR: 11:00 UTC / 17:30 local time: VYYY 081100Z 24007KT 7000 SCT018 FEW020TCU BKN100 35/24 Q100111:30 UTC / 18:00 local time: VYYY 081130Z 15005G15KT 6000 -TSRA BKN018 FEW020CB BKN100 35/24 Q100212:00 UTC / 18:30 local time: VYYY 081200Z VRB10G20KT 3000 +TSRA BKN010 FEW015CB OVC080 30/27 Q100312:30 UTC / 19:00 local time: VYYY 081230Z 03008KT 4000 TSRA BKN012 FEW016CB OVC100 30/27 Q1004Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Myanmar Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Myanmar Times   Location  Images: photo (c) Shadman Samee; Dhaka-Shahjalal International Airport (DAC/VGHS); 12 June 2018; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Visibility at Sudbury was poor and the flight was not able to land. The flight crew elected to return to Toronto, where a normal landing was made at 01:25 hours local time (May 10). As the aircraft was taxiing to the gate, a collision occurred with a fuel truck. The aircraft spun and sustained serious damage to the left side of the flight deck. The left hand rear cargo door was pushed inward and the no.1 propeller also suffered damage. Findings as to causes and contributing factors: 1. The limited field of view to the right of the fuel tanker driverÂs cab caused by the front elevating service platform and its structural elements, along with the condensation on the windows, resulted in the driver being unable to see the aircraft in time to avoid the collision. 2.

The five occupants of the DHC-2 sustained fatal injuries. The DHC-3 pilot sustained minor injuries, nine passengers sustained serious injuries, and one passenger sustained fatal injuries.  The purpose of both flights was to transport passengers to Ketchikan from the Misty Fjords National Monument area in Alaska, USA. Both flights were converging on a scenic waterfall before returning to the Ketchikan Harbor Seaplane Base. At 12:17:15, the DHC-3 was about level at 4,000 ft mean sea level (msl) on a track of 225Â°, and the DHC-2 was 4.2 nautical miles south of the DHC-3, climbing through 2,800 ft msl, on a track of 255Â°. About 12:19, the DHC-3 started a descent from 4,000 ft msl, and the DHC-2 was at 3,175 ft msl and climbing. During the next 1 minute 21 seconds, the DHC-3 continued to descend on a track between 224Â° and 237Â°, and the DHC-2 leveled out at 3,350 ft msl on a track of about 255Â°. The airplanes collided at 12:21:14 at an altitude of 3,350 ft msl, 7.4 nm northeast of Ketchikan Harbor. The DHC-3 pilot stated to the NTSB that the flight from the Misty Fjords area had proceeded normally, and he had descended and was maneuvering the airplane to show passengers a waterfall near Mahoney Lake when the collision occurred. Just prior to the collision, he saw a flash from his left side, and experienced a large, loud impact. According to the pilot, the DHC-3 airplane then rolled right and pitched about 40 degrees nose down toward the water in George Inlet. The pilot stated that he was able to maintain some control and flare the airplane prior to impact. The pilot, some passengers, and some bystanders helped the passengers of the DHC-3 evacuate the airplane and move to the shore. The DHC-3 main wreckage came to rest about 80 ft underwater about 400 ft off the east shore of George Inlet. The DHC-2 airplane broke up in-flight after the collision, and the wreckage was scattered over water and mountainous tree-covered terrain northeast of Mahoney Lake on the west shore of George Inlet. Both aircraft were ADS-B-equipped and both pilots were presented with visual traffic information through the iPad with ForeFlight app (DHC-2) and Chelton display (DHC-3). However, the Garmin GSL 71 on the DHC-3 had been turned off, causing pressure altitude of the airplane not to be transmitted with the ADS-B data. Thus, both systems were not able to generate warnings of potential conflicts. Additionally, the DHC-2 was obscured from the Otter pilot's vision by the window frame until the very last moment. The Beaver pilot likely was unable to see the Otter approaching from behind due to the aircraft structure and the passenger seated on his right. Probable Cause: The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the inherent limitations of the see-and-avoid concept, which prevented the two pilots from seeing the other airplane before the collision, and the absence of visual and aural alerts from both airplanesÂ traffic display systems, while operating in a geographic area with a high concentration of air tour activity. Contributing to the accident were (1) the Federal Aviation AdministrationÂs provision of new transceivers that lacked alerting capability to Capstone Program operators without adequately mitigating the increased risk associated with the consequent loss of the previously available alerting capability and (2) the absence of a requirement for airborne traffic advisory systems with aural alerting among operators who carry passengers for hire.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: AAR-21-04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources: KTUU.com  KTVA.com  ADN.com  Coast Guard statement   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Ketchikan, AK; 13 May 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) John Olafson; Ketchikan, AK; 02 July 2013 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot and the sole passenger were fatally injured and the airplane was destroyed. The flight departed MQJ about 1243 destined for Minden-Tahoe Airport (MEV), Nevada. Radar data depicted the airplane departing from runway 7 at MQJ. Shortly after departure, the airplane began a left turn towards an air traffic control (ATC) assigned heading of 320Â°. After reaching an altitude of about 1,400 ft MSL, the airplane descended until it disappeared from the radar. A witness on the ground at MQJ reported seeing the airplane in an estimated 90Â° left bank with the nose parallel to the horizon shortly after departure. He observed the airplane's nose lower slightly before rising again to a level attitude. At no point did he observe the nose of the airplane rise above the horizon. The nose of the airplane again lowered and the airplane impacted the ground. The airplane impacted a flooded cornfield and exhibited significant fragmentation. The wreckage and debris field covered an area of about 270 ft long and 103 ft wide. The initial ground scar was aligned on about a 327Â° magnetic heading (MH). The nose of the airplane came to rest on a 268Â° MH and the tail came to rest on a 182Â° MH. Both engines separated from the airplane and were located about 197 ft from the point of initial impact, roughly aligned with the ground scar. A post-impact fire incinerated about 80% of the airplane. Probable cause: ""The pilot's failure to fully advance the power levers during the takeoff and initial climb, which led to his failure to maintain sufficient airspeed and resulted in the exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack and a subsequent aerodynamic stall.""METAR: 16:15 UTC / 12:15 local time: KMQJ 221615Z AUTO 17006KT 4SM SCT014 BKN040 OVC055 16/16 A3001 RMK AO116:35 UTC / 12:35 local time: KMQJ 221635Z AUTO 17009G14KT 10SM SCT006 BKN040 OVC095 16/16 A3002 RMK AO116:55 UTC / 12:55 local time: KMQJ 221655Z AUTO 18008KT 10SM SCT006 BKN046 BKN095 18/18 A3001 RMK AO1Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN19FA148 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: theindychannel.com  indystar.com  CNN   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; near Indianapolis Regional Airport, IN (KMQJ); 22 May 2019; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft came to rest in trees. The cause of the accident with the An-2 RA-68161 aircraft was a drop in engine power during takeoff, which led to the need for a forced landing immediately after the aircraft took off, as a result of which a rolling out of the runway occurred with a subsequent collision with the trees of the forest belt. The drop in engine power was due to the destruction of the exhaust manifold flame tubes, which led to a loss of engine power on takeoff due to the ingress of exhaust gases into the carburetor through an open choke. The destruction of fragments of the exhaust manifold flame tubes occurred as a result of overheating of the material during operation. Contributing factors are most likely to be: - shortcomings in the technical operation of the aircraft: flight operations over a long period of time without taking into account the engine operating time and without obtaining the Airworthiness Certificate (without carrying out the work necessary to obtain it); - lack of sufficient distance to safely end the takeoff.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: MAK  Russian Emergency Situations Ministry   Location  Images: photo (c) Ministry of Emergency Situations in the Stavropol Territory; Zhuravskoye; 22 May 2019 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot was not found and presumed fatally injured. According to the owner of the airplane, he purchased the airplane two days prior to the accident. The airplane had recently undergone a progressive inspection, which was completed on May 22, 2019. The owner then hired a contract pilot to fly the airplane to Fort Lauderdale-Executive Airport (FXE) to have some avionics work done.  The aircraft departed St. Louis Regional Airport, Illinois, USA at 18:36 UTC (13:36 local time) on the flight to FXE. The aircraft climbed to the cruising altitude of FL390.  The pilot established communications with the Atlanta Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) and reported he was level at FL390, and that the air was smooth. Later, the air traffic controller tried to communicate with the pilot to tell him to contact the Jacksonville ARTCC, but the controller was unable to make contact with the pilot. The controller made several attempts to contact the pilot on different radio frequencies, to no avail. The controller then advised Jacksonville ARTCC that communications with the flight had been lost. The Jacksonville controllers then continued to monitor the flight via radar. The flight transitioned through Jacksonville and Miami ARTCC airspace without any radio contact. The US Air Force dispatched two Homestead AFRES F-15 aircraft to intercept the accident airplane. One of the interceptor pilots reported that he could see the pilot unconscious and slumped over the controls. The intercept airplanes followed the accident airplane until it descended and impacted the Atlantic Ocean about 310 miles east of FXE. The US Coast Guard initiated a search after the accident, which was suspended on May 25, 2019. The pilot and the airplane were not recovered.

Of the 128 passengers and crew onboard, one flight attendant sustained serious injuries and one flight attendant sustained minor injuries. The airplane was not damaged. The flight was operating under 14 CFR Part 121 as a regularly scheduled passenger flight from Chicago Midway International Airport (KMDW), Chicago, Illinois, to KJAX. According to the captain, as the flight approached 15,000 feet, he noticed there was a scattered layer of clouds they needed to descend through, and so he elected to provide the 10,000-foot chime to the flight attendants early. As the flight descended through the layer at about 12,000 feet, the airplane encountered moderate turbulence. The seat belt sign was off, and the flight crew had turned off the weather radar about 5 minutes before because they had observed no weather between the airplane and KJAX.  According to the flight attendants (FA), the turbulence was encountered shortly after they received the 10,000-foot chime and begun their final walkthrough of the cabin. The two FAs in the aft cabin were thrown into the air and then struck the floor. One of the injured FAs was transferred to a passenger seat for the remainder of the flight. The flight crew was notified of the injury, who requested that paramedics meet the airplane at the gate. After landing, the two aft FAs were transported to the hospital where one was diagnosed with a fractured ankle. Post accident examination of the weather data determined that the turbulence was encountered in the vicinity of the sea breeze front and localized convergence where towering cumulus clouds (cumulus congestus clouds) were depicted on the satellite imagery. There was no lightning detected, pilot reports (PIREPs), or inflight advisories for convection or turbulence current for the area.   Probable Cause: an encounter with convectively induced turbulence while penetrating cumulus clouds during descent.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA19CA151 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA19CA151  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

At 1842 UTC (0242 LT), at night, the aircraft commenced pushback from stand B1. The push back operation used a towing tractor with the three crew members consisting of a towing tractor driver, a wing-man and a headset-man, a task performed by an aircraft mechanic. There was no briefing among the crew related to the pushback activity including the push back maneuver. The towing tractor driver and wing-man used high visibility vest while the headset-man used company uniform without any fluorescence strip or high visibility vest. The push back maneuver did not follow the guideline and the headset-man walked behind the nose wheel while observing the engine start process. During a turn, the aircraft nose wheel passed over the right foot of the headset-man. The towing tractor driver felt a bump and noticed that the headset-man laid on the ground. The headset-man was evacuated to the nearest hospital for medical treatment and found to have sustainied a fracture on his right tarsometatarsal. Contributing factors of the occurrence: The different assumption of pushback maneuver between headset-man and the push back tractor driver, and both were fixated to their own duties while working on a reduced alertness condition, resulted in the towing tractor driver did not aware of the headset-man position and the headset-man did not aware of the nose wheel position. These conditions led to the nose wheel passed over the headset-man foot.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSC Report number: KNKT.19.05.10.04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSC Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates09-Apr-2023 14:07 harro Added Corrections or additions? ...

The flight crew comprised the captain (Pilot Flying, PF) and the co-pilot (Pilot Not Flying, PNF). Also, a ground engineer was on board. The purpose was to ferry the aircraft to Savonlinna to restart scheduled flights between Savonlinna and Helsinki-Vantaa.  The runway at Savonlinna was cleared from snow but there was packed snow at the edges. Because snow kept falling, the runway condition was considered 'poor', which was reported to the arriving aircraft. At 05:43 the captain reported being established on the ILS localiser. The AFIS officer reported that wind was 220 degrees at five knots and that runway 12 was free. The pilots used 20 degrees flap during the approach. According to the flight data recorder the approach was stable until the threshold. During the final approach the pilots saw the approach and runway lights well. Owing to the icing conditions they intended to use an airspeed which was 10 knots higher than the Aircraft Operations ManualÂs prescribed minimum approach speed. At the threshold their speed was 126 knots, while the approachÂs target speed was 120 knots. However, the airspeed at the touchdown zone markings was 123 knots. Contrasting from normal, the aircraft floated close to the surface for 6-7 seconds before touching down. The flight crew did not consider aborting the landing. Following the level flight the captain steered the aircraft toward the ground at a fairly high vertical speed. The aircraft touched down at 05:50, approximately 307 metres after the optimal touchdown point, on the left side of the runway. At touchdown the airspeed was 109 knots, which corresponds to the 110 knot target speed. Judging by the marks on the snow the left main landing gear hit the left snowbank on the uncleared area. The nose gear touched the runway, following which the left main gear became airborne for a moment and the right main gear touched the ground. The left main gear touched down again. After having travelled approximately 100 metres from the first touchdown point the aircraftÂs nose gear and the right main landing gear moved outside the cleared runway area. The aircraft was tracking towards the left, away from the direction of the runway. The pilots tried to turn the aircraft back towards the runway centreline. According to the markings the aircraft began to turn and started to skid sideways outside the cleared area of the runway. When the left main gear hit a high snowbank outside the runway, the aircraft began to turn more sharply to the left. The left engine stalled when snow entered its air intake. The pilots did not deploy reverse thrust. The right main gear knocked one runway edge light over. The aircraft stopped in half-metre deep snow outside the runway, at a 110 degree angle in relation to runway 12. The accident caused considerable damage to the aircraft. Both of the aircraftÂs propellers were damaged as well as the nose landing gear. The Safety Investigation Authority stated that this accident demonstrated the fact that the operating licences and air operator licences issued by the EU Member StatesÂ aviation authorities do not guarantee constant and uniform safety levels among air carriers. While the EUÂs regulations have aimed at ensuring the most open participation in tendering, they may result in overlooking the safety of aviation as one criterion in tendering. The purchaser organising the public tender for air services will not necessarily impose any safety-associated criteria because of being cautious about breaking EU competition rules and the court processes launched by losing bidders. Often the price and on-time performance are the tender criteria. Purchasers of air services do not have suitable and straightforward indicators to assess air carrier safety. Clients and purchasers may also include those that are not deeply familiar with the aviation branch. CONCLUSIONS 1. The operating licences and air operator licences issued by the EU Member StatesÂ aviation authorities do not guarantee constant and uniform safety levels among air carriers. 2. While the EUÂs regulations have aimed at ensuring the most open participation in tendering, they may result in overlooking the safety of aviation as one criterion in tendering. 3.

Often the price and on-time performance are the tender criteria. 4. Purchasers of air services do not have suitable and straightforward indicators to assess air carrier safety. Clients and purchasers may also include those that are not deeply familiar with the aviation branch. 5. The airline had not completely complied with its own safety management system. Oversight authorities do not always detect the difference between the safety management that operators promise to follow and their real-world practices. 6. At no time did the flight crew consider aborting the landing. 7. The airlineÂs operational manuals (OM-A and OM-B) were inconsistent concerning maximum crosswind components. The instructions were difficult to follow in practice. 8. Regardless of the alert to the Emergency Response Centre, no information about the airliner accident was relayed to the regionÂs divisional officer on duty because, owing to the situation assessment, there was no need to deploy rescue service units. 9. The Cockpit Voice Recorder had not recorded anything from the flight in question, and the earlier recordings that were retrieved from its memory were of extremely poor quality. The recording quality of the FDR, when compared to modern recorders, was poor. The magnetic tape of the FDR was worn, which caused defects in the recording.METAR: 03:20 UTC / 05:20 local time: EFSA 070320Z 21004KT 180V260 3000 -SN BKN006 OVC017 M02/M02 Q101103:50 UTC / 05:50 local time: EFSA 070350Z 22005KT 170V260 2500 SN BKN005 OVC015 M02/M02 Q101004:50 UTC / 06:50 local time: EFSA 070450Z AUTO 23005KT 180V270 4300 -SN OVC006 M01/M02 Q1010Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: SIAF Report number: L2019-01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) Safety Investigation Authority Finland; Savonlinna Airport (SVL/EFSA); January 2019 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The captain, first officer flight attendant, and 6 passengers on board were not injured and the airplane sustained substantial damage.  As the airplane arrived in the Uvalde area, ARTCC cleared the airplane to descend to 4,000 ft. After leveling off at 4,000 ft, the flight crew canceled their IFR clearance and proceeded to the airport visually. The pilot flew over the runway and entered a left downwind visual traffic pattern to see if there were any animals on the runway and what the windsock on the airport indicated. The pilot stated that they did not see the windsock as they passed over the runway.  There were no animals on the runway, but the air was turbulent. The flight crew called their downwind and base legs over the airport's common frequency. On base leg, the pilot had the copilot set the flaps to 30Â°. As the pilot turned the airplane onto the final approach for landing, the copilot lowered the landing gear. The airplane was 4.5 miles from the end of the runway at 2,500 ft agl and an airspeed of 170 kts. The copilot completed the ""Before Landing"" checklist. The pilot confirmed the thrust reversers were armed and called for the flaps to be set to 45Â°. At 2 miles from the end of the runway, the pilot checked his approach speed and confirmed the landing gear was down. The pilot reported there was turbulence and wind gusts from the hills below and to the west of them. As they passed 50 ft. and coming over the runway, the pilot reduced engine power to idle. The pilot reported they then encountered a windshear. Their airspeed dropped rapidly and the airplane ""was forced down"" to the runway. The pilot unlocked the thrust reversers, applied brakes, and reached to deploy the ground spoilers. As he deployed the thrust reversers, the pilot said it felt like the right landing gear collapsed. He applied full nose-left rudder and left-wing-down aileron, but the airplane continued to veer to the right. The pilot tried using the tiller to steer to the left with no response. The airplane exited the side of the runway and went into the grass. A representative for the airport reported that the airplane on landing hit hard. About two thirds of the way down runway 35, the airplane slid off the right side of the runway. The airplane proceeded through a ditch and struck a perimeter fence before coming to a stop.

The captain and first officer were fatally injured and the airplane sustained substantial damage. The airplane was registered to Priority Air Charter LLC and operated by AFM Hardware Inc. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the positioning flight, which was destined for Akron-Canton Regional Airport (CAK), North Canton, Ohio. The airplane was part of a test program for new, higher horsepower engine installation. Soon after liftoff and about 3 seconds after decision speed (V1), the left engine lost total power. The propeller began to auto-feather but stopped feathering about 3 seconds after the power loss. The airplane yawed and banked to the left, descended, and impacted terrain. The airplane struck power lines and trees before impacting the ground and came to rest about 200 yards from the end of runway 19. The main wreckage was upright and oriented on a northwesterly heading, with the fuselage separated forward of the wings. The left wing was broken aft and upward and the inboard leading edge of the right wing was crushed aft. The left engine was broken aft and outboard of the wing's leading edge. The right engine was broken downward at the nacelle. The nose of the airplane was located forward and left of the airplane main wreckage. Recorded engine data indicated the power loss was due to an engine flameout; however, examination of the engine did not determine a reason for the flameout or the auto-feather system interruption. While it is plausible that an air pocket developed in the fuel system during the refueling just before the flight, this scenario was not able to be tested or confirmed. It is possible that the auto-feather system interruption would have occurred if the left power lever was manually retarded during the auto-feather sequence.  The power loss and auto-feather system interruption occurred during a critical, time-sensitive phase of flight since the airplane was at low altitude and below minimum controllable airspeed (Vmc). The acutely transitional phase of flight would have challenged the pilots' ability to manually feather the propeller quickly and accurately. The time available for the crew to respond to the unexpected event was likely less than needed to recognize the problem and take this necessary action Â even as an immediate action checklist/memory item. Probable cause: The loss of airplane control after an engine flameout and auto-feather system interruption during the takeoff climb, which resulted in an impact with terrain.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN19LA056 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: news5cleveland.com  Flightaware.com  indeonline.com  NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Kidron-Stoltzfus Airfield, OH; January 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Kidron-Stoltzfus Airfield, OH; January 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Kidron-Stoltzfus Airfield, OH; January 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Kidron-Stoltzfus Airfield, OH; January 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) David Overmire; Liverpool International Airport (LPL/EGGP); 30 October 2016 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

During the take-off run from runway 26 at CYUY, the aircraft began to veer to the left.  It continued to do so until the left main landing gear rolled off the surface of the runway and hit a snow windrow 5 feet beyond the edge of the runway. The aircraft continued to veer to the left and came to rest in a compacted snowbank 40 feet from the runway. One of the passengers received minor injuries. The aircraft sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, landing gear, and propellers. The accident occurred during the hours of darkness, when visibility was reduced to approximately 2 statute miles in snow showers. Findings as to causes and contributing factors: 1. The pilot flying did not look far enough ahead for long enough to notice that the aircraft was deviating to the left before veering off the runway. 2. Given that the pilot monitoring was not looking out the window to monitor the aircraftÂs path, he did not notice the deviation and was therefore unable to help the pilot flying correct the deviation in the path during the take-off roll. 3. The strong authority gradient between the pilots reduced the effectiveness of monitoring, which resulted in a failure to detect and correct the deviation from the departure path. 4. During the takeoff-rejection procedure, the pilot flying accidentally caught the right engine power lever with his finger, pushing the lever completely forward, and placed only the left lever in the idle position, which produced a significant dissymmetry in the torque and accentuated the deviation from the path, resulting in the runway excursion. 5. Since the pilot flying was able to place only 1 power lever in the idle position, it is highly likely that he did not have his right hand on the levers, contrary to what is stated in the standard operating procedures. Consequently, he was not ready to quickly and safely reject the takeoff.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A19Q0010 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: TSB A19Q0010   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Â There were no injuries and the airplane received substantial damage.  According to flight crew statements, the crew advised the tug driver they were cleared to push back, either tail east or straight back. At the time of the accident, dark night conditions existed and the ramp was contaminated with snow.  During the pushback, the flight crew started No. 1 and 2 engines. The tug driver pushed the airplane back with its empennage towards the east and then notified the captain that he would pull forward to straighten them out. As the tug driver pulled the airplane forward and was coming to a stop the airplane's nose began to drift to the left.Â  The tug detached from the airplane and impacted the right forward fuselage and right engine air intake resulting in substantial damage. The captain noted that the nose swung to the left, and then said it felt as if the airplane was moving backwards.  According to the operator, on the morning of the accident, the ramp management company had instructed their ground personnel that all pushbacks should be straight back pushes due to the snowy conditions. It is likely that the angle of the towbar from pushing the airplane back to the east, combined with the snow contaminated ramp and the engine idle thrust, caused the tug driver to lose control of the tug during the pushback. Probable Cause: loss of control of the tug by the driver during pushback operations as a result of the contaminated ramp, angle of the towbar, and the airplane engines being at idle thrust.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA19CA079 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane was substantially damaged and there were no injuries to the three flight crew and one non-revenue company mechanic onboard.  The flight departed Laredo International Airport, Texas, USA at 18:26 CST on an IFR flight plan. There were no irregularities or operational issues reported during the takeoff and enroute portion of the flight. According to the flight crew, the captain was the pilot flying when the accident occurred. At 19:58, the Birmingham Approach air traffic controller advised the crew that the wind at TCL was from 200 degrees at 4 knots. The crew acknowledged and advised that they would use runway 4. The controller instructed them to report the airport in sight. At 20:01, the crew reported the airport in sight, and the controller cleared them for the visual approach. There was no communication regarding any difficulty with the airplane. According to the flight crew, about 12 miles from the airport the captain called for flaps 15 and gear down. After the gear was selected down, the CVR recorded the first officer stating, ""yeah it's down, but [unintelligible] the lights [unintelligible]"" The crew reported that they noted a red warning light for the nose gear position, and heard the audible gear warning horn. The CVR recorded the captain queried, ""what horn was that?"" and the first officer (FO) responded, ""[unintelligible] gear warning horn."" The flight engineer (FE) stated that he recommended that they recycle the gear, the captain declined. The FO stated that he recommended that they go around to troubleshoot, the captain declined. The CVR recorded multiple automated ""sink rate, pull up"" warnings and the captain responded, ""yeah, yeah, I got it."" The FO then queried, ""you gonna go around?"", and the captain responded, ""ah I'm gonna go I got, it, I got it."" The captain reportedly stated that the airplane had a history of a microswitch issue, and pressed on the gear handle and light. As the power was reduced to idle, the gear warning horn and the GPWS audible alerts sounded.  The captain continued the approach and after landing, upon derotation, the forward fuselage contacted the runway and the airplane quickly slid to a stop with the nose gear retracted.

The aircraft sustained significant damage to the right side of the fuselage that affected the airframe, the hydraulic system and the landing gear. Causes/Contributing factors:  The investigation has determined that the accident was caused by the loss of control of the aircraft on the ground in conditions close to the maximum demonstrated cross wind limit due to the fact that this maneuver was not performed according to the procedure published by the manufacturer.  The following are considered to be contributing factors: - The absence of communication between crew members on cross wind landing technique during the approach briefing. - The surprise and shock effect on the crew produced by the behaviour of the aircraft in the first moments after the landing, which affected negatively their subsequent actions and caused them to react instinctively instead of applying the procedure published by the manufacturer.METAR: 16:00 UTC / 17:00 local time: LEPA 281600Z 32026G40KT 9999 FEW020 15/05 Q1006 NOSIG16:30 UTC / 17:30 local time: LEPA 281630Z 32024G34KT 290V350 9999 FEW020 14/06 Q1007 NOSIG 17:00 UTC / 18:00 local time: LEPA 281700Z 32024G34KT 9999 FEW020 14/06 Q1007 NOSIG Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIAIAC Report number: A-004/2019 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: CIAIAC History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  13 September 2011 OY-CIM Cimber Sterling 0 Copenhagen-Kastrup Airport (CPH/EKCH) min Engine failure 19 February 2021 EC-LYJ Swiftair 0 Palma de Mallorca Airport (PMI/LEPA) min Tire failure Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane was being operated by Guardian Flight as an IFR air ambulance flight. The pilot, flight paramedic, and flight nurse were fatally injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the destination airport.  The flight departed Anchorage-Ted Stevens International Airport (PANC), Alaska, about 16:04 destined for Kake. At 18:07 the Anchorage Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) cleared the flight for the area navigation (RNAV) runway 11 approach to Kake. The accident airplane crossed the CEMGA waypoint on the RNAV runway 11 approach at an altitude of about 7,000 ft, then turned northeast and crossed the ZOLKO initial approach fix about 5,000 ft msl. The airplane then initiated a gradual descent and continued northeast toward the JOJOE intermediate fix. About 18:10, while the flight was between ZOLKO and JOJOE, the airplane entered a right turn toward a southerly heading and began a rapid descent, losing about 2,575 ft of altitude in 14 seconds.

Both pilots were killed. The aircraft operated flight 503, an instrument flight rules flight itinerary from Yellowknife to WhatÃ¬ Airport, WekweÃ¨tÃ¬ Airport, and Ekati Aerodrome.  During the flight preparations at Yellowknife the first officer (FO) noted that the right-side vacuum-driven attitude indicator was not erect. The captain assured the FO that the instrument would start to operate. The flight took off from Yellowknife at 08:51. During the climb, while working the after-takeoff checklist, it appeared that the right-side ADI still wasn't working. The captain suggested to the FO that he should tap the attitude indicator to see if it was stuck or frozen. The FO replied that the attitude indicator was still not erect. While en route at FL120 the pilots attempted to troubleshoot the right-side attitude indicator, but to avail.  At 09:11, after having commenced the descent, the captainÂs attitude indicator on the left-side instrument panel displayed a red ""GYRO"" flag and the autopilot disconnected. At this time the captain began to manually fly the aircraft with partial flight instruments. The aircraft continued to descend, and the captain attempted to initiate a climb. The aircraft climbed briefly before beginning to descend again. The aircraft subsequently entered a gradual left turn that progressed into a steep descending left turn (spiral) from which the aircraft never recovered. The investigation established that both the captain and the FO had an iPad mini equipped with the ForeFlight Mobile application which had the capability to provide a backup attitude indication and synthetic vision view to both pilots. Since it was a backup feature, Air Tindi did not have a formal training program in place for using the attitude and heading reference system (AHRS) feature of ForeFlight. Findings as to causes and contributing factors: 1. For undetermined reasons, the left-side attitude indicator failed in flight. 2. Although just before take off the crew acknowledged that the right-side attitude indicator was not operative, they expected it to become operative at some point in the flight. As a result, they did not refer to the minimum equipment list, and departed into instrument meteorological conditions with an inoperative attitude indicator. 3. The crewÂs threat and error management was not effective in mitigating the risk associated with the unserviceable right-side attitude indicator. 4. The crewÂs crew resource management was not effective, resulting in a breakdown in verbal communication, a loss of situation awareness, and the aircraft entering an unsafe condition. 5. The captain did not have recent experience in flying partial panel. As a result, the remaining instruments were not used effectively and the aircraft departed controlled flight and entered a spiral dive. 6. The captain and first officer likely experienced spatial disorientation. 7. Once the aircraft emerged below the cloud layer at approximately 2000 feet above ground, the crew were unable to recover control of the aircraft in enough time and with enough altitude to avoid an impact with terrain.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A19W0015 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: CBC  Transport Canada History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  5 April 2014 C-GTUC Discovery Air International 0 Near Cambridge Bay Airport min Windscreen cracks or failure Location  Images: photo (c) TSB; WhatÃ¬/Lac La Martre Airport, NT (YLE); 30 January 2019 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The captain was the pilot flying and the first officer was the pilot monitoring. The en route flight, the descent and the initial approach for runway 27 at Billund proceeded uneventfully, with the aircraft being radar vectored for an Instrument Landing System (ILS) approach. On final approach to runway 27, Billund Tower cleared the aircraft to land and reported the wind conditions to be 200Â° 12 knots (kts), maximum 29 kts, and minimum 5 kts. Throughout the approach, the flight crew experienced moderate turbulence. The flight crew modified final approach speed (VAPP) was 148 kts (the flight crew added 2 kts the calculated VAPP of 146 kts). At 1000 ft, and at 500 ft Radio Height (RH), the first officer made calls on stabilized approach. The aircraft was configured for landing, with flap position 3, stabilized, and the autopilot engaged and the autothrust engaged and activated in SPEED mode. At approximately 700 ft RH, the flight crew got visual contact with the runway. The Calibrated Air Speed (CAS) from 500 ft RH down to initial touchdown varied between approximately 160 kts CAS and 145 kts CAS. The aircraft remained stabilized on both localizer and glidepath down to 100 ft RH. On short final, the first officer informed the captain of a displayed crosswind of 36 kts. At approximately 190 ft RH, the captain disconnected the autopilot and flew the final approach manually with the autothrust engaged and activated in SPEED mode. At 100 ft RH, the first officer made a standard operating call on aircraft pitch attitude: Pitch 2.5. From approximately 100 ft RH until 35 ft RH, the vertical speed increased from approximately 700 ft/minute (min) to approximately 1100 ft/min. At approximately 25 ft RH, the captain used an abrupt and progressive aft sidestick input and pulled back on the sidestick to full aft  deflection to stop the rate of descent. The synthetic voice calls TWENTY, RETARD and the initial touchdown occurred almost simultaneously. Before recorded activation of both main landing gear squat switches (weight on wheels - WOW), the captain advanced the thrust levers forward of the climb detent position. The aircraft made an initial touchdown at approximately 148 kts CAS, with a recorded pitch angle of 5.63Â°, a rate of decent of approximately 750 ft/min, and a vertical acceleration of 2.59 g. Upon initial touch down, the ground spoilers did not extend, and the autothrust deactivated. The aircraft lifted off the ground and up to 12 ft RH. During the bounce, the captain repeatedly voiced his surprise on the lack of flare. In the air, the engines spooled up, and the CAS increased to approximately 156 kts. Two synthetic voice calls on excessive pitch (PITCH), and one thrust lever retarding synthetic voice call (RETARD) sounded. The captain retarded the thrust levers to flight idle resulting in ground spoiler extension. The aircraft made a second touchdown at approximately 154 kts CAS, with a recorded pitch angle of 9.49Â° and a vertical acceleration of 2.56 g. The aircraft tail section struck the runway. Upon landing, neither of the pilots perceived that a tailstrike might have occurred, and the flight crew continued taxiing to the apron. During taxi to the apron, the captain briefed the passengers on the hard landing. The AIB considers the contributing factors to this specific tailstrike to be: - Gusting and strong crosswinds in dark night. - Moderate turbulence and downdrafts on short final to runway 27 at EKBI. - Too high sink rate, just prior reaching the flare height (destabilization). - No flight crew calls and/or decision on going around on short final or during the bounce. - Two hard landings. - Inappropriate thrust lever management. - Inappropriate pitch control during the bounce resulting in a pitch angle increasing beyond the critical angle.METAR: 17:20 UTC / 18:20 local time: EKBI 021720Z 35006KT 5000 BKN007 00/M00 Q100318:20 UTC / 19:20 local time: EKBI 021820Z 33007KT 7000 SCT007 BKN025 00/M01 Q1004Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: HCLJ Report number: 2019-57 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SHK   Location  Images: photo (c) AIB Denmark; Billund Airport (BLL); February 2019 photo (c) AIB Denmark; Billund Airport (BLL); 08 February 2019 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The captain was fatally injured, and the co-pilot was seriously injured. The airplane was operated by Conquest Air Cargo on a cargo flight from Opa Locka to Nassau, Bahamas and back. The flight to Nassau was normal until the co-pilot had to adjust the left engine propeller control to adjust speed for cruise flight. When he manipulated the control, there was no movement on the gauge and the power was stuck at 2,400 RPM. He tried to re-set the propeller control circuit breaker, but to no avail. The captain equalized power on both engines and the flight was uneventful to Nassau. Once on the ground, the captain asked the co-pilot to send a text message to maintenance control, but the message never transmitted. The captain told the co-pilot not worry about it and if they were unable to re-set the propeller control on the ground during the engine run-up then they would shut down and call maintenance. The co-pilot stated to the NTSB that before they began the accident flight, the engines started normally and both propellers were cycled. The left propeller control had re-set itself and they departed for Opa Locka. The co-pilot was Pilot Flying on the return leg and everything was normal until climbing through 4,000 ft when the left engine propeller control stopped working and the power was stuck at 2,400 RPM. The captain tried to adjust the control and bumped the power up to 2,700 RPM. The captain took control of the airplane and tried to stabilize the power on both engines. He leveled off at 4,500 ft, cancelled their instrument flight rules flight plan, and flew via visual flight rules direct to Opa Locka. The flight was normal until they began their descent down to 1,500 ft. The right engine suddenly backfired and began to surge. The flight crew used the checklist to feather the propeller and shut down the engine. Shortly after the left engine backfired and began to surge. As the captain flew the airplane, the co-pilot attempted to handle the emergency. Once he realized they were too low and were going to ditch, he asked the captain what he wanted to do. The captain told him to declare a May Day and brace for impact. The co-pilot said the impact with the water was violent and the tail had separated from the empennage.

The three occupants were uninjured. The airplane sustained substantial wing and fuselage damage. After reviewing the weather at the destination airport the pilots decided they would be landing on runway 24 using the GPS approach. They reviewed weather at least ""4 or 5 times"" on the installed avionics display and the pilot stated that the displayed information indicated conditions of 1.5 miles visibility, ceiling of 1,500 ft, wind 090 at 4 knots, with fog and mist. The crew discussed the approach and talked about having a 4 knot quartering tailwind. When the airplane was near Richmond, the first officer listened to the automated weather observing system recording and it was reporting 3/4 mile visibility and 1,500 ft ceiling, scattered 300, wind 090 at 4 knots, temp 0C, dew point 0 C, altimeter 30.13 inches of mercury. The pilot indicated, ""All this information said we had the numbers to make the approach to runway 24, (5,500 feet long)."" The pilot used the autopilot fly the approach to just before minimums. The airplane was about ""300 ft"" and the first officer called the runway to the left. The pilot looked up and saw the precision approach path indicator lights to the left and the runway straight ahead. However, the runway appeared to have a ""very light coating of snow on it."" The pilot elected to land and apply full thrust reverse and braking. The pilot also queried the first officer about the spoilers and the first officer confirmed the spoilers were out. A few seconds later the pilot felt the airplane was not slowing much and advised the first officer that the airplane was going to go off the end. At that point, the first officer said that he saw the 2,000 ft marker ahead of the airplane. Both pilots were pushing the brakes as hard as they could and full reverse was applied. The airplane went off the end of the runway and ended up across a road near the runway. Probable Cause: The flight crew's decision to continue an unstable approach under conditions that exceeded the airplane's landing performance capabilities, which resulted in a runway overrun and impact with terrain.METAR: 14:55 UTC / 09:55 local time: KRID 111455Z AUTO 08004KT 1/2SM FG SCT003 OVC015 00/00 A3012 RMK AO215:15 UTC / 10:15 local time: KRID 111515Z AUTO 08004KT 1SM BR SCT003 OVC015 00/00 A3013 RMK AO2Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN19LA090 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Of the 75 passengers and crew onboard, one flight attendant sustained serious injuries while two flight attendants and two passengers received minor injuries. The airplane sustained minor damage. The flight  was operating under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 as a regularly scheduled passenger flight from the John Wayne-Orange County Airport (KSNA), Santa Ana, California to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (KSEA), Seattle, Washington.  According to the flight crew, about 40 minutes into the flight when the airplane was in smooth air and 'between cloud layers', the captain informed the flight attendants that they could begin cabin service but left the seatbelt sign illuminated for passengers because there was a report of 'occasional light chop'. About 20 minutes later, the flight encountered an area of severe turbulence that lasted about 8 seconds and caused the airplane to rapidly gain altitude and the traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS) to issue a resolution advisory (RA) for opposite-direction traffic 1,000 ft above them. The first officer (FO) , who was the flying pilot, disengaged the autopilot and applied forward control pressure to comply with the RA.  The FO could not obtain the target flight path vector directed by the TCAS, so the captain assisted on the controls to obtain the desired pitch attitude. After the airplane descended back to its assigned altitude, the TCAS RA cleared, and the captain informed air traffic control of the turbulence and TCAS RA. According to the flight attendants (FA), the turbulence was encountered as they were beginning the beverage service. Two of the FAs impacted the ceiling before falling to the floor and one passenger, who had been in the lavatory at the time of the encounter had a small head laceration. As a result of the injuries, the captain declared an emergency and the flight diverted to KRNO. The FA in the aft galley was assisted by a medically qualified passenger and remained on the floor until landing due to her injuries. She was transported to the hospital and diagnosed with a broken arm.  Post accident examination of the weather satellite data depicted cloud patterns aloft consistent with the presence of a convective updraft coincident with the flight's location at the time of the turbulence encounter. The convection appeared to be Ã¢â¬ÅembeddedÃ¢â¬Â with stratiform clouds and may not have been visually identifiable by the flight crew. Probable Cause: an inadvertent encounter with convective turbulence that resulted in a TCAS RA, which required an abrupt control input by the flight crew to resolve the conflict.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA19CA081 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA19CA081  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates14-Feb-2019 08:20 Goklerdeyiz.net Added 15-Feb-2019 18:30 Captain Adam Updated [Time, Other fatalities, Location, Narrative, ]08-Mar-2019 08:56 harro Updated [Time, Total occupants, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, ]31-Mar-2021 08:22 ASN Update Bot Updated [Time, Other fatalities, Nature, Destination airport, Source, Damage, Narrative, Category, Accident report, ]31-Mar-2021 10:47 harro Updated [Nature, Source, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

Of the 145 passengers and crew onboard, one flight attendant sustained serious injuries and one received minor injuries. The airplane was not damaged. The flight was operating under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 as a regularly scheduled passenger flight from Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport (KBZN), Bozeman, Montana, to KATL. According to the flight crew, air traffic control informed them to expect light and occasional moderate turbulence during the descent. About 10 minutes before beginning their descent, the flight crew illuminated the seat belt sign and instructed the flight attendants (FA) to stow the carts and take their seats. Shortly after departing FL350 for FL250, and the airplane encountered two 'rapid-bumps of light-moderate turbulenceÃ¢â¬Â at approximately FL345. The flight crew slowed the airplane and contacted the FAs and was informed that the aft FA was injured. According to the flight attendants, the flight had been routine, having experienced only occasional light turbulence. The two aft FAs had finished their meal service and secured the galley. The two FAs were making their final walkthrough of the cabin when the captain made the public address announcement to discontinue cabin service, when the turbulence was encountered. The two aft FAs reported they were thrown up to the ceiling and then came 'crashing back downÃ¢â¬Â onto the galley floor. One of the FAs was in intense pain after striking the floor hard and was attended to by two medically qualified passengers. The FA was moved to an empty passenger row for landing and was provided oxygen and pain medication. The flight crew declared an emergency and requested paramedics meet the flight at the gate. The FA was transported to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a fractured vertebra. Post accident examination of the weather data determined that the accident flight was in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) in an area of convectively induced turbulence due to embedded rain shower activity when the turbulence was encountered. While there was no lightning activity around the accident site at the accident time, there were pockets of strong rain shower cells within the complex of precipitation as a whole. The area where the accident occurred was covered by AIRMET Tango that warned of moderate turbulence conditions. Probable Cause: an encounter with convective turbulence during descent.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA19CA091 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA19CA091 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  19 June 2010 N3730B Delta Air Lines 0 New York-John F.

At 12:34, the airplane was descending through 13,800 ft, and the controller advised of an area of light to heavy precipitation along the flight route and that they could expect vectors around the weather. About 12:35, the flight was transferred to the Houston TRACON final controller, and the pilot reported they had received the Houston Automatic Terminal Information System weather broadcast. The controller told the pilots to expect vectors to runway 26L and asked if they wanted to go to the west or north of the weather. Radar data indicated the airplane continued the descent through 12,000 ft with a ground speed of 290 knots, consistent with the arrival procedure. The pilots responded that they wanted to go to the west of the area of precipitation. The controller advised that to do so, they would need to descend to 3,000 ft expeditiously. About 12:37, the controller instructed the pilots to turn to a heading of 270Â°. Radar data indicated the airplane turned, and the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) data indicated a selected heading of 270Â°. The airplane was descending through 8,500 ft at this time. About 12:38, the controller informed the pilots that they would be past the area of weather in about 18 miles, that they could expect a turn to the north for a base leg to the approach to runway 26L, and that weather was clear west of the precipitation area. The pilots responded, ""sounds good"" and ""ok.""  At this time, radar and ADS-B returns indicated the airplane levelled briefly at 6,200 ft and then began a slight climb to 6,300 ft. Also, about this time, the FDR data indicated that some small vertical accelerations consistent with the airplane entering turbulence.  At 12:38:31, the airplaneÂs go-around mode was activated. Shortly after, when the airplaneÂs indicated airspeed was steady about 230 knots, the engines increased to maximum thrust, and the airplane pitch increased to about 4Â° nose up. The airplane then pitched nose down over the next 18 seconds to about 49Â° in response to nose-down elevator deflection. The stall warning (stick shaker) did not activate. FDR, radar, and ADS-B data indicated that the airplane entered a rapid descent on a heading of 270Â°, reaching an airspeed of about 430 knots. A security camera video captured the airplane in a steep, generally wings-level attitude until impact with the swamp. FDR data indicated that the airplane gradually pitched up to about 20 degrees nose down during the descent. The NTSB found that the first officerÂs repeated uses of incomplete and inaccurate information about his employment history on resumes and applications were deliberate attempts to conceal his history of performance deficiencies and deprived Atlas Air and at least one other former employer of the opportunity to fully evaluate his aptitude and competency as a pilot. He had a long history of training performance difficulties and his tendency to respond impulsively and inappropriately when faced with an unexpected event during training scenarios at multiple employers suggest an inability to remain calm during stressful situations; a tendency that may have exacerbated his aptitude-related performance difficulties. Probable Cause: The NTSB determines that the probable cause of this accident was the inappropriate response by the first officer as the pilot flying to an inadvertent activation of the go-around mode, which led to his spatial disorientation and nose-down control inputs that placed the airplane in a steep descent from which the crew did not recover. Contributing to the accident was the captainÂs failure to adequately monitor the airplaneÂs flightpath and assume positive control of the airplane to effectively intervene. Also contributing were systemic deficiencies in the aviation industryÂs selection and performance measurement practices, which failed to address the first officerÂs aptitude-related deficiencies and maladaptive stress response. Also contributing to the accident was the Federal Aviation AdministrationÂs failure to implement the Pilot Records Database in a sufficiently robust and timely manner.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NTSB/AAR-20/02 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Flightradar24  Atlas Air statement  FAA statement  NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Trinity Bay, near Anahuac, TX; February 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Trinity Bay, near Anahuac, TX; February 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Trinity Bay, near Anahuac, TX; February 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Trinity Bay, near Anahuac, TX; 23 February 2019 photo (c) Flightaware; Trinity Bay, near Anahuac, TX; 23 February 2019 photo (c) NTSB; Trinity Bay, near Anahuac, TX; 23 February 2019 photo (c) NTSB; Trinity Bay, near Anahuac, TX; 23 February 2019 photo (c) NTSB; Trinity Bay, near Anahuac, TX; 23 February 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Trinity Bay, near Anahuac, TX; 23 February 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; 02 March 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; March 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) Jaime Escobar; Miami International Airport, FL (MIA/KMIA); 26 October 2017 photo (c) Reiner Geerdts; Miami International Airport, FL (MIA/KMIA); 19 January 2019 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft slid sideways off the left side of the runway and became stuck in snow.  The six occupants were not injured. The aircraft operated on a flight from Baku, Azerbaijan. The en route and descent part of the flight were uneventful. The flight crew performed an ILS approach to runway 24C at Sheremetyevo Airport. The aircraft was cleared to land on runway 24C and wind was reported from 300Â° at 5 m/s (10 kts) with gusts to 10 m/s (20 kts). At a height of 80 meters, the captain switched off the autopilot and continued manually. The aircraft touched down at an airspeed of 150 knots, 250 m pas the runway threshold. Brakes were applied and the thrust reversers were deployed. During rollout the no.2 engine was brought back to idle and the thrust reverser stowed. The no.1 (left) engine remained at maximum reverse, causing the aircraft to swing to the left, off the side of the runway. Conclusion: The reason for the accident with the Gulfstream G200 4K-AZ88 was the stowing of the right-engine reverser by the captain from maximum thrust reversal while maintaining maximum thrust reversal on the left engine, which led to the appearance of a significant turning moment to the left. The aircraft turning to the left in the presence of a cross wind to the right, as well as turbulence of the airflow near the rudder due to the open thrust reversal mechanism of the left engine and possible ice deposition on the outer surfaces of the aircraft, which led to the development of a significant swing moment on the rudder. The development of a significant articulated moment on the rudder, in the absence of power steering in the rudder control system, led to its deviation to the leftmost position despite significant (up to 82 kg or 180 pounds) forces exerted by the crew on the pedals. The deviation of the rudder (pedals) to the left also led to the deviation of the nose wheel to the left. The total moment from the running reverse of the left engine, from the right engine in direct draft mode, and from the rudder and nose wheel deflection to the left, led to the aircraft rolling out of the runway and its damage. Separate braking applied by the crew could not prevent the aircraft from rolling out. The contributing factors could have been: - the crew did not take into account the provisions of the AOM about the possible ""destabilizing"" effect of the thrust reverse when landing with a cross wind on the runway with a reduced braking coefficient; - increased psycho-emotional tension of the crew members due to long dissatisfaction and emotional discussion of instructions and actions of ATC controllers. At the same time, the instructions and actions of the ATC service controllers were in line with established procedures.METAR: 06:00 UTC / 09:00 local time: UUEE 260600Z 31006MPS 9000 -SHSN SCT009 BKN020CB 01/00 Q1000 R24C/550336 R24L/550345 TEMPO 1000 SHSN07:00 UTC / 10:00 local time: UUEE 260700Z 32006MPS 9000 -SN OVC008 01/00 Q1000 R24C/550336 R24L/550345 NOSIG08:00 UTC / 11:00 local time: UUEE 260800Z 33006MPS 9999 OVC011 01/M00 Q1001 R24C/550336 R24L/550345 NOSIG09:00 UTC / 12:00 local time: UUEE 260900Z 33006MPS 5000 -SN SCT008 OVC023 01/M00 Q1001 R24L/550345 R24C/550336 NOSIG10:00 UTC / 13:00 local time: UUEE 261000Z 33005MPS 9999 OVC009 01/00 Q1002 R24L/550345 R24C/510345 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: MAK   Location  Images: photo (c) MAK; Moskva-Sheremetyevo Airport (SVO); 26 February 2019 photo (c) MAK; Moskva-Sheremetyevo Airport (SVO); 26 February 2019 photo (c) MAK; Moskva-Sheremetyevo Airport (SVO); 26 February 2019 photo (c) MAK; Moskva-Sheremetyevo Airport (SVO); February 2019 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Of the 219 passengers and crew onboard, one flight attendant received serious injuries and one received minor injuries. The airplane was not damaged. The regularly scheduled domestic passenger flight was operating under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (KDFW), Dallas, Texas, to PHNL. The captain was the pilot flying and the first officer was monitoring. The flight had been unremarkable, with a smooth ride while cruising at FL380, in good visual meteorological conditions (VMC). The flight crew stated that about 15 mins before decent they checked the weather with Honolulu Control Facility (HCF) and was informed of turbulence ""light to moderate all alts"". The captain called the purser and informed him of the expected turbulence and to prepare for the arrival early by stowing the carts and securing the cabin. The seat belt sign was on. About 15 minutes later, they began their initial descent and encountered moderate to severe clear air turbulence about FL310, which lasted about 10 to15 seconds.  The ride smoothed out at about FL290, and the flight crew then received a call from the cabin, indicating that two flight attendants in the aft galley had been injured.  After landing both injured flight attendants were transported to a hospital where one was diagnosed with a fractured vertebra.

While the aircraft was being prepared for flight, both pilots reported being aware of a sweet-smelling odour after the APU and APU bleed had been turned on to heat the cabin. They described the smell as being like caramel but considered that such odours were not unusual after the APU is started and the air conditioning is switched on at the beginning of the day. Following completion of passenger boarding, the aircraft pushed back and taxied before being cleared to enter Runway 26, back-track and line up for take-off. It was daylight, the visibility was in excess of 10 km and the wind was from 210Â° at 5 knots. The APU was shut down as the aircraft entered the runway and the air conditioning packs remained on with air supplied from the engines. A few seconds later, while back-tracking, both pilots became aware of fumes in the flight deck with a different odour, which the co‑pilot described as being like paint or white spirit. The wind was behind the aircraft at this point, so they initially thought the fumes were due to exhaust gas ingestion. Upon lining up at the runway threshold the flight crew had a brief discussion about whether the fumes were decreasing and decided that they were. Upon receiving take-off clearance, the co-pilot advanced the thrust levers to 40% while holding the aircraft on the brakes and checked the engine indications, which were all normal. He then slowly advanced the thrust levers towards the take-off setting, while still holding the aircraft on the brakes. As the engines reached approximately 55% power, he saw something out of the corner of his eye which he believed to have been a puff of smoke coming from an air conditioning vent. He immediately stated that he was not happy with the situation and retarded the thrust levers to idle. By then the smell of fumes had grown worse and smoke was visibly entering the flight deck. The commander set the park brake and asked the co-pilot to turn the engine bleeds and air conditioning packs to off and the flight deck windows were opened to ventilate the flight deck. There were no EICAS messages or warnings. The commander established contact with the senior cabin crew member (SCCM), who had simultaneously been trying to contact the flight deck. The SCCM reported that there was smoke and fumes in the cabin, but that the cabin crew could not identify the source. The commander decided to evacuate the aircraft. The co-pilot immediately selected flap 5, notified ATC of the intention to evacuate and requested assistance. Both pilots then carried out the Emergency Evacuation âvital actionsâ.  During the evacuation, passengers who evacuated via the over-wing exits reported being unsure of how to get down from the wing to the ground and several re-entered the cabin and exited via one of the escape slides. The smoke and fumes were subsequently attributed to an incorrectly performed engine compressor wash procedure, which was carried out by maintenance personnel the night before the occurrence flight. As a result of the findings of this investigation, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has undertaken two safety actions relating to the certification requirements for over-wing emergency exits. The operator has also undertaken several safety actions relating to passenger safety briefings, processes for maintenance planning, engineer training, competency and welfare and monitoring of ground equipment. Four Safety Recommendations are made relating to the certification requirements for over-wing exit markings and the height requirement for over-wing exits to be equipped with an assisted means of escape.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: AAIB-25591 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: 1.

The No 1 engine had been shut down in accordance with the operatorâs SOPs. As it approached the stand, at walking pace, the commander applied the brakes, which had no effect and the aircraft hit signage and the rotating No 2 (right) propeller struck a nearby ground power unit (GPU).  During the collision the aircraft sustained damage to the nose fuselage behind the radome, a nose landing gear door and right propeller tips. There were no injuries to the passengers or crew. There were a series of minor factors which coincided to cause this accident. The landing was the last of a day which had consisted of repeated and routine sectors. The absence of the approach checks meant that the aircraft was not configured correctly in preparation for the operatorâs SOP in which, after landing, the No 1 engine is shut down and the aircraft taxied to the stand on the No 2 engine. That did not predestine the aircraft to remain in this incorrect configuration. There was a further intervention during the after landing checks with the check of the stby hyd press and ptu cntrl advisory light. However, this check was also overlooked when the crew were distracted by remembering that the aircraft required an OSG check after the last flight of the week which then interrupted the after landing checks. After this, there were no other prompts during the remainder of the taxi by which to indentify the situation. When the accident sequence was underway, and the crew realised what was happening, the co-pilot remembered the stby hyd press and ptu cntrl were off and tried to switch them on, by which time it was too late.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: EW/G2019/03/01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: AAIB Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates11-Jun-2023 14:26 harro Added Corrections or additions? ...

The landing of the aircraft occurred under unfavorable weather conditions caused by heavy rain over the airfield and sudden variation in the direction and intensity of the surface wind. At the exact moment of the touch down, the wind was from a direction of 057Â° at 19kts. The contact of the aircraft with the ground occurred about 916m beyond the threshold of runway 15 with the right main landing gear completely outside the lateral limits of the runway, at a speed of 121kts. After landing, the aircraft traveled 668m outside the runway. The pilot regained control of the aircraft and returned it to runway 15. Contributing factors. - Control skills Â a contributor. The corrections applied to the flight commands, in order to control the tendency of the aircraft to laterally deviate to the right in relation to the center of SBGL runway 15, were not sufficient to stop this movement, nor to redirect the aircraft to the central axis of flight. Consequently, the aircraft touched the ground with the right main landing gear outside the runway's lateral limits. - Organizational climate Â undetermined. When considering the organizational climate present in the company at the time of the occurrence, it is possible that this scenario has influenced the assessments and, consequently, the crew's decision to proceed with the landing, despite the adverse conditions encountered. - Adverse meteorological conditions Â a contributor. The significant change in the direction and intensity of the wind in the final approach, which started to blow from the left abeam, and the increase in the intensity of the rain on the Aerodrome, which impaired the pilots' peripheral vision and compromised the exact notion of depth of the aircraft in relation to the runway, contributed to the drifting movement of the aircraft to the right side of the SBGL runway 15. - Crew Resource Management Â a contributor. When the aircraft was flying below 100ft height, the copilot conducted several callouts stating that the aircraft was off the runway axis. The commander collated the first ones, however, after a certain moment; he no longer properly responded to the copilot's callouts and proceeded to land, despite the repeated alerts received. The copilot, even realizing that the commander's corrections were not enough to control the aircraft and return it to the central axis of the runway, did not ask the commander, more assertively, to execute a go-around procedure in flight. This showed that the crewmembers had enough information to discontinue the landing, but they chose not to use this feature, which contributed to the occurrence. - Piloting judgment Â a contributor. There was an incomplete assessment of the aircraft's flight conditions. Once the tendency of lateral deviation to the right of the central axis of the runway was detected, the pilots thought it possible to correct this tendency in time to make the landing safely, which contributed to the outcome of the occurrence. - Perception Â a contributor. The maintenance of the focus on the lateral deviation of the aircraft interfered in the identification of other variables present, such as the condition of destabilization and low visibility, which could affect the landing in a safe way. Thus, this selective perception, reinforced by the expectation of completing the landing at the destination, contributed to the outcome of this occurrence. - Management planning Â undetermined. All crewmembers on flight O66227 were called for the mission in accordance with the on notice roster. The calling of the copilot and the flight chief did not adhere to the established in the company's MGO; consequently, both were late to present themselves for the aircraft commander. Flight O66227 took off 30 minutes after the scheduled time. It is possible to consider that the delayed takeoff from Salvador to Rio de Janeiro had a negative influence on the assessments and the decision of the crewmembers to proceed with the execution of the landing. - Decision-making process Â a contributor. There was a compromised analysis of the information available to the crew, so that the aircraft's destabilization condition was not considered, as well as the meteorological degradation in the final approach, culminating in the decision to try to correct the aircraft until the last moment, even if unanswered, and proceed with the landing on SBGL.METAR: 20:00 UTC /  local time: SBGL 032000Z 15006KT 9999 4000NE -TSRA FEW012 BKN025 FEW027TCU FEW030CB OVC080 27/24 Q101320:18 UTC /  local time: SBGL 032018Z 08004KT 3000 +TSRA FEW012 BKN025 FEW030CB OVC090 27/25 Q101420:43 UTC /  local time: SBGL 032043Z 02008G22KT 0500 R15///// R33///// R10/1000 R28/170 0 +TSRA FEW004 BKN009 BKN020 FEW030CB 23/22 Q1016Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CENIPA Report number: A-036/CENIPA/2019 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: CENIPA  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates15-Mar-2024 19:45 ASN Updated [Source, Accident report, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Throughout the 133 nautical mile flight, the aircraft encountered a number of snow squalls, which reduced the flight visibility to approximately 3 nm. The pilot elected to continue the flight through these areas of snow squalls. As the aircraft approached Little Grand Rapids from the south, the pilot had the airport environment in sight and manoeuvred the aircraft to join a 3 nm final approach and descent for runway 36. When the aircraft was approximately 1.75 nm (3,24 km) from the threshold of runway 36, it encountered another snow squall, which reduced the flight visibility to less than 1 nm (1,85 km). The aircraft continued the descent in reduced visibility over the snow-covered frozen surface of Family Lake. At approximately 14:14, the pilot made the decision to initiate a go-around; however, as power was being applied, the aircraft collided with the frozen surface of Family Lake, 0.75 nm (1,39 km) from the threshold of runway 36. The aircraft remained upright and slid to a stop on the snow.  The pilot and passengers egressed the aircraft, and were transported to the Little Grand Rapids nursing station for evaluation.

The first officer and two of the passengers were injured. The airplane was substantially damaged. The accident flight departed from Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), New Jersey, about 10:04. The captain was the pilot monitoring, and the first officer was the pilot flying. The en route portion of the flight was uneventful.  Once the airplane was in range of PQI, the flight crew received an updated airport weather report at the time, a special weather observation at 10:31. The observation indicated that the wind was from 090Â° at 5 knots, visibility was 1/2 mile in moderate snow and freezing fog, and the cloud ceiling was broken at 1,100 ft and overcast at 1,800 ft. At 11:01 a controller from the Boston Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) cleared the flight for an ILS approach to runway 1, and the crew was subsequently instructed to change to the PQI common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF); PQI did not have an air traffic control tower.  The captain made position reports during the approach and at 11:08:38 she stated that the approach was stable and that she had ""ground contact.""  At 11:09:54, the captain stated, ""runway in sight. See it?"" to which the first officer responded, ""yeah"" and ""well I got somethinÂ [that] looks like a runway up there.""  After losing sight of the runway, at 11:10:09, the captain stated, ""go missed"" twice. The first officer stated that, when he transitioned from looking at the instruments to looking outside, he expected to see the runway but saw what he described as ""white on white.""  The airplane had descended to a minimum pressure altitude of 703 ft (169 ft agl) before beginning to ascend.  The flight then positioned for a second approach to runway 1. The captain made the 1,000-ft callout at 11:27:21 and stated that the approach was stable. At 11:28:37, the enhanced ground proximity warning system announced ""minimums,"" shortly after the captain had made the 100-ft callout. About 2 seconds after the ""minimums"" annunciation, the captain called, ""runway in sight twelve oÂclock."" The first officer stated that, when he transitioned from the instruments to the outside during the second approach, he saw ""white on white"" again and blowing snow. The first officer also stated that it was difficult to comprehend what he was seeing outside the airplane because everything was covered in snow and that, before he could determine what he was seeing, the airplane touched down.  The airplane came to rest in the snow-covered grassy area between runway 1 and a parallel taxiway located about 630 ft to the right of the runway. The airplaneÂs resting location was about 3,600 ft beyond the runway threshold, about 305 ft to the right of the runway centerline, and about 230 ft from the right edge of runway. Probable Cause: The flight crewÂs decision, due to confirmation bias, to continue the descent below the decision altitude when the runway had not been positively identified.  Contributing to the accident were (1) the first officerÂs fatigue, which exacerbated his confirmation bias, and (2) the failure of CommutAir pilots who had observed the localizer misalignment to report it to the company and air traffic before the accident.METAR: 15:31 UTC / 10:31 local time: KPQI 041531Z AUTO 09005KT 1/2SM -SN FZFG BKN011 OVC018 M02/M04 A2971 RMK AO2 P0000 FZRANO RVRNO15:56 UTC / 10:56 local time: KPQI 041556Z AUTO 08006KT 1/2SM SN FZFG OVC013 M02/M04 A2970 RMK AO2 SLP103 P0001 T10221044 FZRANO RVRNO16:18 UTC / 11:18 local time: KPQI 041618Z AUTO 06004KT 1/2SM SN FZFG M03/M04 A2968 RMK AO2 P0000 FZRANO RVRNO16:43 UTC / 11:43 local time: KPQI 041643Z AUTO 07005KT 3/4SM -SN SCT008 OVC013 M01/M04 A2967 RMK AO2 P0001 FZRANO RVRNOAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA19FA089 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Flightaware   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Presque Isle International Airport, ME (PQI); 04 March 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Presque Isle International Airport, ME (PQI); 04 March 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Presque Isle International Airport, ME (PQI); 04 March 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) Charles Walters; Los Angeles International Airport, CA (LAX/KLAX); 24 January 2008 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

At 08:34 the aircraft took off from Miraflores and flew to San Jose del Guaviare (SKSJ) to refuel, where it landed at 09:14. The aircraft was fueled and the crew submitted a flight plan to Villavicencio with a total flight time of 45 minutes an altitude of 8,500 feet. Prior to departure one more passenger boarded the flight.  The aircraft took off at 09:55. At 10:15, when the aircraft was climbing through 8,100 feet and approximately 59NM (109 km) from Villavicencio, the flight reported engine problems and their failure to feather the propeller.  At the crew's request, ATC provided information on the location of several aerodromes in the area and the crew chose to proceed to La Rinconada aerodrome. The aircraft lost altitude and last radio contact was at 10:32 when the crew radioed that they had a runway in sight, with no further information. At 10:34 the aircraft hit the ground of a palm plantation with a high angle of descent and low speed. Flaps and undercarriage were retracted at the time of the accident. The aircraft slid across a gravel road and burst into flames. Probable Cause(s). The investigation determined that the accident was caused by the following probable causes: - Loss of control in-flight as a consequence of the decrease in minimum in-flight control speed and drag generated by the impossibility of performing the No. 1 engine propeller feathering in the face of engine failure. - Malfunction of the lubrication system of engine No. 1, evident in the abundant oil leakage from the engine, in flight, and in the governor of the left propeller; although discrepancies were found in the maintenance of the propeller feathering pressure line, it was not possible to determine the origin of the oil leakage. - Weaknesses in the aircraft Operator's operational procedures, lacking a standard that would facilitate a crew's decision making to act in the event of critical failures, in matters such as making an emergency landing on unprepared field or the selection of an alternate airfield. Contributing Factors: - Deficiencies in standard maintenance practices during repairs performed on the No. 1 engine's propeller propeller feathering oil pressure line. - Non-compliance with an effective and reliable maintenance program, which did not verify the operating conditions of the aircraft components; it was not possible to determine compliance with the last 50-hour service, Phase A, to engine No. 1 according to the company's maintenance program, since there are no records of that service in the Flight Log. - Inefficient safety management system of the Operator for not detecting errors in the maintenance processes and in the conduct and control of operations.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Aerocivil Report number: COL-19-10-GIA Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: elespectador.com  Aerocivil   Location  Images: photo (c) William Wilson; Villavicencio Airport (VVC/SKVV); 10 March 2011 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were no survivors among the 157 occupants. Takeoff roll began from runway 07R at 08:38 hours local time, with a flap setting of 5 degrees and a stabilizer setting of 5.6 units.  At 08:38:44, ten seconds after rotation, the left and right recorded Angle of Attack (AOA) values deviated. The left AOA decreased to 11.1Â° then increased to 35.7Â° while value of right AOA indicated 14.94Â°.  This resulted in the onset of the stick shaker followed by a master caution light. At the same time the captainÂs primary flight display (PFD) showed a drop in indicated airspeed (IAS) from 170Kt to 156Kt. The captain initially responded by reducing the pitch as a reaction to the stick shaker. This did not stop the stick shaker and the captain to stopped applying further nose down column input at a pitch angle of 7-8Â° above horizon Approaching 400 ft, the captain attempted to engage the autopilot (AP) but it was not successful. A second attempt failed as well. Passing 1000 ft radio altitude, at the third attempt, the autopilot was successfully engaged.  The captain asked the first officer to advise ATC of the inability to follow the planned departure due to a flight control problem and to request runway heading and climb 14,000ft. The left stall management yaw damper computer which was affected by inputs from a failed left AOA sensor calculated the left hand minimum operational airspeed erroneously above 340kt (VMO). This resulted in an overspeed warning. At the same time, the auto throttle operation was affected by the erroneous left AOA sensor value and remained in the Arm mode and failed to transition to N1 mode, which would have reduced the take-off thrust to climb thrust automatically.  The auto throttle did not give a warning or a failure flag for the flight crew when its operation was affected by the failed AOA sensor value. The first activation of the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) system occurred within a second where the auto throttle was supposed to reduce from take-off thrust to climb trust. And in less than another second the GPWS aural alert ""DONÂT SINK"" sounded twice. The activation of MCAS followed by GPWS aural alert with already ongoing stick shaker coupled with no failure flag or warning from the auto throttle in an extremely high workload environment must have caused the auto throttle remaining in the ARM mode with take-off thrust set to remain unnoticed by the crew.  At 08:39:45, captain requested flaps up and the first officer moved the flap handle to position 0. The autopilot then disengaged and the flaps reached the up position. At 08:40:00, because of the erroneous left AOA value, the MCAS activated the first automatic nose down trim for 9 seconds. At the end of the first MCAS activation the stabilizer position was 2.1 units with the captain pulling to pitch up the airplane, with a force of around 90 lbs (41 kg). At different times when the pilot applied electrical trim for short duration or longer duration the trim stopped at about 2.3 for unknown reasons. At 08:40:20 the second MCAS activation, lasting 7 seconds, was interrupted by the captainÂs electric trim up inputs. The captain applied a nine second electric trim-up input which fully counteracted the second MCAS input and stopped the GPWS warning but it did not bring the aircraft to a neutral trim condition. When MCAS activated for the third time an automatic nose-down trim was commanded there was no corresponding motion of the stabilizer, which is consistent with the stabilizer trim cutout switches being in the ÂcutoutÂ position. The captain repeatedly requested the first officer to pull up with him on the control column with pitch values oscillating between 7Â° nose up and -2Â° nose down. Pitch increased when both pilots applied forces, pitch decreased when a single pilot applied force (force oscillated between 80 lbs and 110 lbs (36-50 kg)). The vertical speed variations followed the variations of the pitch angle, with vertical speed was oscillating between -2,500 ft/min and 4,400 ft/min. The captain requested the first officer to try the manual trim wheel, and after seconds of intense efforts, the first officer told the captain that it was not working. This was due to the amount of force required to turn the trim wheel. At this moment the stabilizer trim was at 2.3 units with the IAS at 340 Kts. At 08:42:10 the captain asked and the first-officer to request radar control a vector to return. ATC instructed ET302 to turn right heading 260 degrees. During the radio communications with the ATC, the first officerÂs action on the control column was released which increased forces on the captainÂs control column. The captain then requested the first officer to check the Master Caution. Then, they both announced ""left alpha vane"". At this time the airplane was almost reaching the minimum safe altitude. After about 10 seconds the captain then told the first officer that they should pitch up together. The captain then told the first officer ""pitch is not enough"" and ""put them up"". A sound similar to stab trim cut-out switches being returned to normal was recorded on the CVR, thus the stab trim cut out switches were most likely turned back on at that moment. After a failed attempt to trim using the manual trim wheel as per the runaway stabilizer non-normal checklist and significant and unbearable amount of force on the control column, the flight crew were trying to find other means to relieve the force. The airplane was at 13800 ft; IAS was 367kt, pitch just below 1Â°, stabilizer at 2.3 units of trim, bank angle 21Â° right. The crew was busy pulling on the controls with high muscular force trying to maintain airplane flight path control and reach 14000 ft, a target on which they remained focused. Trying to maintain flight path control was a very demanding task and represented here a high workload, physically and mentally, to the detriment of every other task.  An overspeed warning added another disruption and disturbance on board. The cockpit noise environment was unsettling and further impacted the flight crewÂs concentration. Immediately after the stab trim cut-out switches were put back in normal position, the crew attempted another unsuccessful autopilot engagement as the plane was approaching 14000 ft. At the same time, the captain applied two brief electric trim up inputs of 1 second each while pulling on the control with an average force of 100 Lbs (45 kg). The force on the controls remained between 75 and 100 Lbs.  At 08:43:20, five seconds after the trim-up inputs, the fourth MCAS triggered. The plane started to descend. During the 9-second MCAS activation, the stabilizer decreased from 2.3 units to 1 unit of trim. The captain repeatedly shouted to the first officer to pitch up. The forces were physically unmanageable by both flight crews. The aircraft began pitching nose down.  The airplane hit the ground eighteen seconds after the end of the 4th MCAS. The investigation noted that intermittent flight control system abnormalities began well before the accident flight. Maintenance actions of relevance started occurring in December 2018 when the airplane was one month old and included several pilot write ups involving temporary fluctuations of vertical speed and altitude. There were also three reports of the airplane rolling during autopilot operation. Altitude and vertical speed indications on the PFD showed erratic and exaggerated indications.  From the maintenance log book report the airplane also suffered intermittent electrical/electronic anomalies in addition to the flight control system malfunctions. For example, three days before the crash the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) Fault Light illuminated, and the APU had a protective shutdown. The onboard maintenance function computer message also indicated the Start Converter Unit (SCU) showed the APUÂs start system was inoperative. The SCU is located in the electrical and electronics (E/E) compartment. The captainÂs personal computer power outlet also had no power. The possibility of intermittent electrical/electronic system defects were an underlying issue. The AOA sensor malfunction on the accident flight most likely occurred as the result of a power quality problem that resulted in the loss of power to the left AOA Sensor Heater. Evidence indicates the loss of power was likely due to a production related intermittent electrical/electronic failure involving the airplaneÂs Electrical Wiring Interconnection System (EWIS) and the AOA Sensor part. Probable cause of the accident Repetitive and uncommanded airplane-nose-down inputs from the MCAS due to erroneous AOA input, and its unrecoverable activation system which made the airplane dive with the rate of -33,000 ft/min close to the ground was the most probable cause of the accident. Contributing Factors 1. The MCAS design relied on a single AOA sensor, making it vulnerable to erroneous input from the sensor; 2. During the design process, Boeing failed to consider the potential for uncommanded activation of MCAS, but assumed that pilots would recognize and address it through normal use of the control column, manual electric trim, and the existing Runaway Stabilizer NNC. The OMB and Emergency AD issued after the Lion Air accident included additional guidance but did not have the intended effect of preventing another MCAS-related accident; 3. While Boeing considered the possibility of uncommanded MCAS activation as part of its FHA, it did not evaluate all the potential alerts and indications that could accompany a failure leading to an uncommanded MCAS; 4. The MCAS contribution to cumulative AOA effects was not assessed; 5. The combined effect of alerts and indications that impacted pilotÂs recognition and procedure prioritization were not evaluated by the Manufacturer; 6. Absence of AOA DISAGREE warning flag on the flight display panels (PFD); 7. The B737 MAX Crew difference CBT training prepared by Boeing and delivered to Pilots did not cover the MCAS system; 8. Failure by the manufacturer to design simulator training for pilots with regards to safety critical systems like MCAS with catastrophic consquences during undesired activation. 9. The manufacturer failed to provide procedures regarding MCAS operation to the crew during training or in the FCOM; 10. Failure by the manufacturer to address the safety critical questions raised by the airline which would have cleared out crew confusion and task prioritization.METAR: 05:00 UTC / 08:00 local time: HAAB 100500Z 06008KT 9999 FEW025 16/10 Q102906:00 UTC / 09:00 local time: HAAB 100600Z 07010KT 9999 FEW025 18/09 Q1029Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Ethiopia Report number: AI-01/19 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB Response to Final Aircraft Accident Investigation Report  BEA comments   Location  Images: photo (c) LLBG Spotter; Tel Aviv-Ben Gurion International Airport (TLV/LLBG); 08 February 2019; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) David Rubinstein; Nairobi-Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (NBO/HKJK); 22 December 2018 photo (c) David Rubinstein; near Addis Ababa; 22 December 2018 photo (c) Jean-Paul Coupin; Beirut-Rafic Hariri International Airport (BEY/OLBA); 04 February 2019 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

After completing an uneventful landing on sea ice near Tuktoyaktuk for scientific research, they flew the aircraft to Pelly Island located 50 miles to the West. The crew first completed two reconnaissance patterns above the sea ice surface to assess wind and surface conditions. The crew then conducted a final pass and chose an into-wind approach for landing on the sea ice, approximately 1 nautical mile from the island. The aircraft touched down on a smooth area of sea ice but then bounced into the air after contacting a drift perpendicular to the aircraftÂs heading. The aircraft impacted the base of a larger drift once it settled back onto the sea ice. The nose landing gear collapsed and the aircraft came to a stop shortly thereafter. The aircraft sustained very serious damage, with damage to multiple major components as a result of the impact with the snow drifts. No personnel were injured in the accident and all were subsequently evacuated to Inuvik, NT by civilian helicopter. The investigation concluded that the crew did not see the drifts during the two reconnaissance patterns, during the final pass, nor when on approach for landing. The high cirrus cloud layer that obscured the sun contributed to the difficulty in assessing the sea ice surface.Sources: CBC  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

The two pilots and two passengers were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and an instrument flight rules flight plan was filed for the flight that originated from Harrisburg-Capital City Airport, Pennsylvania, and was destined for Monongahela-Rostraver Airport, Pennsylvania.  According to the pilot, the airplane was on approach to Monongahela when he lowered the landing gear handle and heard a crunching noise. He noticed there were no green cockpit indicator lights to confirm that the landing gear was down and locked. The pilot then asked the co-pilot to circle the airport while he looked up the emergency procedures for extending the landing gear in the airplane flight manual. He tried to extend the landing gear manually, but it appeared to be jammed. The pilot and co-pilot discussed the situation and decided to fly to Arnold Palmer Regional Airport (LBE), Latrobe, Pennsylvania since the airport had a control tower and emergency equipment. The pilot flew by the tower and asked if tower personnel could see the landing gear down. The tower controller told him that the landing gear appeared to be down. During the subsequent landing roll , the left main landing gear collapsed, followed shortly by the right main landing gear. The airplane then slid to a stop on the centerline of the runway and the flight crew and passengers egressed the airplane. Examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed that the main landing gear mechanical linkage was compromised, and the right main landing gear actuator shaft was broken. The actuator was retained for further examination. Probable cause: ""A landing gear collapse due to the separation of the actuator pinion bearing support from the actuator, which resulted in the failure of the actuator shaft.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA19LA123 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) FAA; Latrobe-Westmoreland County Airport, PA (LBE); 12 March 2019 photo (c) FAA; Latrobe-Westmoreland County Airport, PA (LBE); 12 March 2019 photo (c) FAA; Latrobe-Westmoreland County Airport, PA (LBE); 12 March 2019 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Both pilots sustained fatal injuries.  The two commercial pilots were conducting a personal, cross-country flight. As the airplane approached the approach end of the landing runway, it began to climb, rolled left, became inverted, and then impacted terrain. The left thrust reverser (T/R) was found open and unlatched at the accident site. An asymmetric deployment of the left T/R would have resulted in a left roll/yaw. The lack of an airworthy and operable cockpit voice recorder, which was required for the flight, precluded identifying which pilot was performing pilot flying duties, as well as other crew actions and background noises, that would have facilitated the investigation. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that it was not equipped, nor was required to be equipped, with a nose landing gear ground contact switch intended to preclude inflight operation of the thrust reverser. Further, electrical testing of the T/R left and right stow microswitches within the cockpit throttle quadrant revealed that the left stow microswitch did not operate within design specifications. Disassembly of the left and right stow microswitches revealed evidence of arc wear due to aging. Based on this information, it is likely that the airplaneÂs lack of an NLG ground contact switch and the age-related failure of the stow microswitches resulted in an asymmetric T/R deployment while on approach and a subsequent loss of airplane control. Also, there were additional T/R system components that were found to unairworthy that would have affected the control of the T/R system. Cause: The airplaneÂs unairworthy thrust reverser (T/R) system due to inadequate maintenance that resulted in an asymmetric T/R deployment during an approach to the airport and the subsequent loss of airplane control.METAR: 20:05 UTC / 15:05 local time: KHSD 182005Z AUTO 00000KT 10SM CLR 19/M02 A3026 RMK A0120:25 UTC / 15:25 local time: KHSD 182025Z AUTO 18007KT 10SM CLR 20/M02 A3025 RMK A0120:45 UTC / 15:45 local time: KHSD 182045Z AUTO VRB03KT 10SM CLR 20/M02 A3025 RMK A01Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN19FA104 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: kxii.com   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Oklahoma City-Sundance Airport, OK (HSD); 18 March 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Oklahoma City-Sundance Airport, OK (HSD); 18 March 2019; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The driver of the vehicle was critically injured and later died in hospital. During the night, three vehicles had been cleared to enter the runway for lighting maintenance work and centreline painting. Two vehicles were in contact with the Tower controller using walkie-talkies. At 01:30 a new Tower controller took over.  One of the vehicles reported vacating the runway at 02:15, with the controller assuming all vehicles had left. The controller on duty handed over his shift at 03:00 to another controller with the information that no more work on the runway was going on. There was also no indication of Work in Progress as a reminder on the flight progress strip bay at the tower console. At 03:08 the Challenger 9M-TST reported his position to the Tower controller while 9 miles out on a final ILS approach to runway 15 After looking out on the runway to check on any abnormal activities or unusual lighting, clearance for landing was given to 9M-TST after the controller was sure that the runway was clear for the aircraft to make a landing. When 9M-TST approach closer on its final approach, the leader of the contractor's worker saw the landing light of the aircraft approaching and realised that there was an aircraft coming in for a landing. All three workers boarded their vehicle and drove away from the runway. While making a 180 degrees turn, the driver realised the escorting vehicle was still static on the runway. They flashed the headlight of the vehicle several times to attract the escort vehicle attention. No response was observed from the escort vehicle, and as the aircraft was getting closer to them, the driver drove his vehicle away from the runway and stopped at taxiway Foxtrot to give way for the aircraft to land. After the aircraft had landed safely, while decelerating with a speed between 90 to 100 knots, the aircraft hit the stationary car. Probable Cause: Incorrect information of vehicle activities on the runway handed over to the taking over controller led to the landing clearance given without realising the runway is occupied.METAR: 19:00 UTC / 03:00 local time: WMSA 171900Z VRB03KT 7000 FEW025 BKN270 27/23 Q101120:00 UTC / 04:00 local time: WMSA 172000Z 00000KT 7000 FEW025 BKN280 27/23 Q1011Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Malaysia Report number: A 02/19 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: New Straits Times   Location  Images: photo (c) Alvin Tan Chun San; Bintulu Airport (BTU/WBGB); 17 September 2014 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The nosewheel steering bypass pin had been installed and the TLD 200MT lift tug was aligned with the aircraft nose landing gear main forging. The tug was being driven by a driver undergoing his first pushback in this model and type of tug, under the direct supervision of a trainer seated alongside in the cab. The tug was being brought forward using its laser guidance system and joystick and was at the point where the 'paddles' close around the nosewheels. Whilst this was taking place the trainer observed movement of the nose gear followed by a bang. The driver immediately stopped the procedure, the brakes were applied, and the trainer and driver exited the cab to investigate the cause of the bang. On inspection they found that the paddle on the left side of the aircraft had contacted, and damaged, the nut on the torque link centre pivot. There also was a significant witness mark on the paddle. They then informed the aircraft commander and the aircraft maintenance company. The scheduled flight was cancelled, and the aircraft taken out of service. There were no injuries reported by the passengers or the crews of the aircraft and tug. It is not clear why the event occurred. The handling company confirmed that the training and knowledge of the requirement to align with the nosewheels was in place. However,  in this case it is possible that a momentary lapse in concentration led to the system being aligned to the nose leg rather than the nose wheels. This error is likely to have gone unnoticed because the 10Â° to 15Â° offset of the nosewheels was not significant enough to indicate a problem.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: EW/G2019/03/11 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: AAIB  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates15-Mar-2024 20:37 ASN Updated [Source, Accident report, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight departed Vienna, Austria, at 10:03 hours local time, bound for Innsbruck. The first officer was Pilot Flying. Foehn conditions were already foreseeable at Innsbruck, but wind shears were not forecast. The en route and descent part of the flight were uneventful. At 10:50 the flight received landing clearance for runway 08 and wind information from the controller at Innsbruck: ""020 deg 11 kt...Kematen 070 deg 17, gusting 32, expect wind checks on final"" (Kernaten is a town located on the runway 08 approach path). Five minutes later the aircraft was on final approach at 30 ft above the ground at a speed (IAS) of about 141 kt. During the next two seconds, the aircraft quickly lost altitude and speed. The first officer noticed that the aircraft was ""pushed down"". The rate of descent was approximately 500-700 ft/min. The first officer increased the power, but at this point the aircraft was already touching down on the runway at a speed of 123 knots.  The first officer pulled up the nose of the aircraft, because of which the pitch angle of the aircraft rose to 7.65Â° when touching down. The rate of descent decreased to approximately 200-500 ft/min by the time of touchdown. The maximum vertical acceleration (along the yaw axis) when touching down was 2.1 g.  A post-landing inspection showed damage to the underside of the rear fuselage, which had touched the runway. On the inside of the rear of the fuselage, stringers and frames were broken and bent. The aircraft was repaired and resumed service on June 4, two months after the accident.

Kennedy International Airport, NY (JFK/KJFK)","Los Angeles International Airport, CA (LAX/KLAX)"," NTSB","Accident investigation report completed and information captured","American Airlines flight 300, an Airbus A321, experienced a left roll during takeoff from runway 31L at New York's JFK Airport.  During the left roll, the airplaneÂs left wingtip struck the ground and a runway distance marker on the left side of the runway. The flight crew completed the takeoff and safely returned to the airport 28 minutes later.  The wind at the time resulted in a 14- to 17-knot crosswind from the right, which was below the companyÂs 35-knot crosswind limitation. The initial takeoff roll proceeded normally, with the captain (the pilot flying) applying left rudder pedal to counter the right crosswind. The captain stated that he kept the airplane near the runway centerline and that ""everything was ok"" when the airplane reached 80 knots. When the airplane reached the rotation speed of 156 knots while still on the ground, the captain made a large left rudder pedal input, from 8Â° to 25Â°, during a 1.5-second timeframe. In response to this large rudder pedal input, the airplaneÂs heading deviated to the left, and its lateral acceleration increased to a maximum of 0.32 G. During a postaccident interview, the captain stated the airplane made a ""significant"" turn to the left. The captain also stated that he was ""looking at the runway edge"" and knew he had to get the airplane into the air. Digital flight data recorder (DFDR) data showed that the sidestick was pulled to its full nose-up position and a right sidestick position. During the aft sidestick and right sidestick application to rotate the airplane, the rudder remained close to its full-left deflection for 3 seconds. As the nose of the airplane lifted off the ground, the airplane began to roll to the left, and the left roll rate accelerated as the main landing gear lifted off the ground, reaching a maximum of 37Â° left wing down as the captain moved the rudder and sidestick to full right and to full aft. These movements arrested the left roll and allowed the airplane to continue to lift off. The large left roll angle immediately after liftoff resulted in the left wingtip striking the ground and a runway distance marker, part of which remained imbedded in the wingtip.  No airplane flight control abnormalities were noted, except for a left aileron deflection as the left wingtip scraped the ground. Thus, the left roll that occurred was in response to the captainÂs left rudder pedal input during rotation of the airplane. Probable cause: The captainÂs excessive left rudder pedal input during the takeoff ground roll, which caused a large heading deviation and a left roll upon rotation that resulted in the left wingtip striking the ground.METAR: 00:51 UTC / 20:51 local time: KJFK 110051Z 36017KT 10SM SCT250 10/M03 A2998 RMK AO2 SLP153 T01001028 23:51 UTC / 21:51 local time: KJFK 102351Z 33015KT 10SM FEW070 FEW250 11/M03 A2996 RMK AO2 PK WND 34026/2257 SLP145 T01111028 10161 20111 53034Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA19LA134 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Flightaware track  ABC7NY   Location  Images: photo (c) Seat 16A; New York-John F.

The aircraft was bound for Hamilton-Marion County Airport (HAB), Alabama. At 15:06 the flight reported climbing through 1300 ft. ATC notified the flight of moderate to severe precipitation in the area of UOX and provided a clearance to 11000 ft MSL. At 15:08 ATC queried the flight for their altitude and informed the flight of moderate to heavy precipitation along their route of flight. The flight acknowledged the radio call and informed ATC they were climbing through 9000 ft for 11000 ft. About 15:12 ATC queried the flight if they were having navigation issues or if they were deviating. The flight responded they were deviating and that they were having ""AC voltage problems."" The last radio call received from the flight was an acknowledgement of a heading assignment to 095 at 15:13. The airplane disappeared from radar about 30 seconds later and the ATC controller tried unsuccessfully to raise the flight on the radio at that time. Preliminary radar data began tracking the airplane at 15:06. The airplane transponder stopped transmitting Mode 3A information about 15:08, so no altitude information was available for the remainder of the flight. The airplane maintained an approximate heading of 080 from 15:06 until about 15:10. At 15:10 the airplane turned right to about 120 heading. At 15:12 the airplane made a left turn to about 040 heading. At 15:13 the airplane began a right turn that continued to a heading of about 270 until radar contact was lost at 15:13:26.

The aircraft and helicopter were destroyed. One helicopter (Shree Airlines Eurocopter AS 350, 9N-ALK) sustained minor damage.  The copilot of the Summit Air plane sustained fatal injuries. Two persons on the ground at the helipad also died in the accident. The L-410 was repositioning to Ramechhap after flying passengers and cargo to Lukla. The captain taxied the aircraft to threshold of runway 24 and handed over control to the co-pilot. Within 3 seconds of the takeoff roll the aircraft veered to the right and exited the runway, travelling about 43 ft across the grassy part on right side of runway 24, before striking the airport inner perimeter fence. It then continued to skid for about 43 ft, and hit two persons before it crashed into the upper helipad. It struck the turning rotor blades of 9N-ALC. The moving rotors cut through the cockpit and the helicopter toppled onto the lower helipad 6 ft below. The left-hand  wing of the aircraft broke the skid of another helicopter, 9N-ALK, and came to a halt with 9N-ALC beneath its right-hand  main wheel assembly Lukla Airport is located on a mountain at an elevation of 9334 feet (2845 m). The runway is 1729 ft long (527 m) with an 11.7% gradient. Takeoffs must be performed from the downsloping runway 24. The helipad is located to the right of the runway, about 100 meters past the threshold. Probable Cause The commission concluded that the probable cause of the accident was aircraft's veering towards right during initial take-off roll as a result of asymmetric power due to abrupt shifting of right power lever rearwards and failure to abort the takeoff by crew. There were not enough evidences to determine the exact reason for abrupt shifting of the power lever. Contributing Factors 1. Failure of the PF(being a less experienced co-pilot) to immediately assess and act upon the abrupt shifting of the right power lever resulted in aircraft veering to the right causing certain time lapse for PIC to take controls in order to initiate correction. 2. PIC's attempted corrections of adding power could not correct the veering. Subsequently, application of brakes resulted in asymmetric braking due to the position of the pedals, and further contributed veering towards right.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Nepal AAIC Report number: AAIR-076/1 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Kathmandu Post   Location  Images: photo (c) Nepal AAIC; Lukla-Tenzing-Hillary Airport (LUA/VNLK); 14 April 2019 photo (c) Nepal AAIC; Lukla-Tenzing-Hillary Airport (LUA/VNLK); 14 April 2019 photo (c) Nepal AAIC; Lukla-Tenzing-Hillary Airport (LUA/VNLK); 14 April 2019 photo (c) David Russell; Kathmandu-Tribhuvan Airport (KTM/VNKT); 14 October 2018 photo (c) Oleg Belaychuk; Lukla-Tenzing-Hillary Airport (LUA/VNLK); 05 November 2018 photo (c) Oleg Belaychuk; Lukla-Tenzing-Hillary Airport (LUA/VNLK); 05 November 2018 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The torque tube assembly of the aircraft's controls had been wrongly installed, causing a flight control reversal.  The aircraft departed SchÃ¶nefeld Airport on a Functional Check Flight and the flight crew soon noticed flight control problems. The aircraft entered steep turns and was exposed to forces of up to +5G. The crew managed to return to SchÃ¶nefeld Airport where an emergency landing was carried out.  In September 2019 it was announced that the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. The Global 5000 accident, that took place at Berlin-SchÃ¶nefeld on April 16, 2019, was the result of a series of omissions and errors that originated in different core areas, and involved many people either directly or indirectly. The technical error that occurred during the installation and adjustment procedure of the RCIMs [Roll Control Input-Modules] represents the event triggering the accident. The system design further enabled this failure, which allowed the RCIMs to be installed and adjusted in such a manner that the MFS [multi-function spoilers] functioned opposite of the corresponding input, and generated no error messages on the EICAS or the PMAT. Since the maintenance crew relied solely upon the EICAS warnings and the results given by the PMAT, the error remained undetected in the tests following the installation.Sources: Bundeswehr-Jet wird nach Bruchlandung vom April ausgemustert (focus.de, 4-9-2019)  Totalschaden am Kanzlerjet (spiegel.de, 3-9-2019)  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

A captain in training assumed the role of pilot-in-command (PIC) and Piot Flying while the line indoctrination captain acted as first officer (FO) and Pilot Monitoring on the flight. The FO conducted a pre-flight inspection of the aircraft and noted that the aircraft had about 1600 pounds of fuel on board. Because he preferred to order fuel directly from a fuel technician, he went to the fuel office in the hangar, but could not find anyone to take the fuel order. Intending to return to the office later, he went to the lounge where he found out that the flight would be delayed pending the arrival of the 2nd flight nurse. When the captain asked if the aircraft was ready for the flight, the FO replied that it was. When preparing for departure, the flight crew completed the BEFORE START checklist. The last step on the checklist was to start the engine. The flight crew then taxied to a run-up area and began the AFTER START checklist. When the FO read out the checklist item FUEL QUANTITY, the captain responded with the text that was printed on the checklist, ""SUFFICIENT/BALANCED,"" but he did not check the fuel quantity indicators. When the checklist was complete, the crew taxied to the runway. The aircraft departed CYWG at 16:39. Roughly 8 NM after the takeoff, while still in the climb, the captain performed a progressive fuel calculation. He did not look at the fuel quantity indicators during the process. The aircraft continued the climb and levelled off at flight level (FL) 250. During the rest of the flight, neither pilot performed periodic scans of the fuel quantity indicators. At 18:13, when the aircraft was about 14 NM west-northwest of Gillam Airport (CYGX) and still level at FL 250, the left fuel pressure (L FUEL PRESS) warning light illuminated, indicating low fuel. The warning was followed almost immediately by power surging in the left engine. The captain turned the boost pump ON, and noticed that the fuel quantity indicators were showing 0 pounds. The captain asked the FO about the fuel quantity, at which point the FO realized that he had forgotten to order fuel. The flight crew declared an emergency with the Winnipeg Area Control Centre (ACC) at 18:14 and began an emergency descent. The weather conditions at CYYQ were marginal, so the decision was made to divert to the alternate aerodrome, CYGX; however, the aircraft continued on the same heading toward CYYQ for another 2 minutes By 18:15, when the aircraft was at FL 220, the left engine had exhausted its fuel supply and lost power. The crew conducted the emergency engine shutdown procedure in the Emergency and Abnormal Procedures Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) to shut down the engine; however, the left propeller continued to windmill at speeds between 1300 and 2000 rpm throughout the ensuing descent. At 18:15:32, the FO programmed the FMS to display a track to CYGX and instructed the captain to turn right and follow the track. The FO moved the heading bugs, which were coupled on both FMS displays, to the CYGX heading. The captain then initiated a right turn toward CYGX. The captain reduced the power setting of the right engine. From 18:15 to 18:18, the rate of descent varied between 3000 and 6000 fpm. The crew extended the landing gear in an attempt to set up a suitable descent angle to Runway 23. At 18:17, the flight crew informed the ACC that the nature of the emergency was fuel related. The ACC provided the flight crew with the weather at CYGX and informed them that emergency services at CYGX would be notified. As the aircraft descended through approximately 5000 feet above sea level (ASL), the FO obtained a vertical navigation (VNAV) profile to Runway 23 on the FMS. The crew retracted the landing gear as the aircraft intercepted the VNAV path.  By 18:20, the airspeed had decayed to approximately 100 knots and the captain was having difficulty controlling the aircraft. At times, the aircraft was descending below the VNAV path. Seeing this, the FO took over control and assumed the Pilot Flying duties. At 18:21, as the aircraft descended through 2800 feet ASL, the left propeller ceased windmilling as the rpm decreased from 1300 to 0 rpm. The flight crew made a Mayday call at 18:21:30 on the CYGX mandatory frequency. When the aircraft was at approximately 2000 feet ASL, it descended below the cloud base and the FO was able to visually identify CYGX. At 18:22:34, when the aircraft was at 1300 feet ASL, roughly 835 feet above ground level (AGL), the right engine lost power. The aircraft could no longer maintain the VNAV path or a suitable visual approach to the runway. When the aircraft was at about 530 feet AGL and 1 NM from the runway, the crew shut down and feathered the right engine while continuing the right-hand curving visual approach to Runway 23. The flaps remained up throughout the approach and subsequent landing. The crew selected the landing gear DOWN when the aircraft was at about 50 feet AGL and the aircraft touched down on the frozen surface of Stephens Lake with the landing gear fully extended. Sufficient airspeed remained to enable the FO to raise the nose as the aircraft approached the rocky shoreline at the approach end of Runway 23. The aircraft struck the rocky shoreline in a nose-high attitude and skidded up onto the right edge of the runway area, coming to rest approximately 190 feet before the threshold . Findings as to causes and contributing factors 1. When the captain asked if the aircraft was ready for the flight, the first officer replied that it was, not recalling that the aircraft required fuel. 2. While performing the FUEL QUANTITY item on the AFTER START checklist, the captain responded to the first officerÂs prompt with the rote response that the fuel was sufficient, without looking at the fuel gauges. 3. The aircraft departed Winnipeg/James Armstrong Richardson International Airport with insufficient fuel on board to complete the planned flight. 4. The flight crew did not detect that there was insufficient fuel because the gauges had not been included in the periodic cockpit scans. 5. When the flight crew performed the progressive fuel calculation, they did not confirm the results against the fuel gauges, and therefore their attention was not drawn to the low-fuel state at a point that would have allowed for a safe landing. 6. Still feeling the effect of the startle response to the fuel emergency, the captain quickly became task saturated, which led to an uncoordinated response by the flight crew, delaying the turn toward Gillam Airport, and extending the approach. 7. The right engine lost power due to fuel exhaustion when the aircraft was 1 nautical mile from Runway 23. From that position, a successful forced landing on the intended runway was no longer possible and, as a result, the aircraft touched down on the ice surface of Stephens Lake, short of the runway.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A19C0038 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: CTV News  Winnipeg Sun  TSB   Location  Images: photo (c) RCMP; Gillam Airport, MB (YGX); 24 April 2019 photo (c) TSB Canada; Gillam Airport, MB (YGX); 24 April 2019 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

It was a training flight to acquire the type rating for the aircraft. The right pilot's seat was occupied by the pilot in command, who was deployed on this flight as a flight instructor. The student pilot, as co-pilot, sat on the left pilot seat and was the pilot flying. For the co-pilot it was the second flight day of his practical training program on the Cessna 551 Citation II/SP. The day before, he had already completed about three flying hours on the plane. At Siegerland Airport, three precision approaches to runway 31 were carried out with the help of the Instrument Landing System (ILS). After the third landing, the tower, due to the changed wind, turned the landing direction to runway 13. The cockpit crew therefore rolled the aircraft to the end of the runway, turned and took off at 14:34 from runway 13. This was followed by a left-hand circuit at an altitude of 3,500 ft AMSL. The approach to runway 13 took place under visual flight conditions. According to both pilots, the checklists were processed during the circuit and the aircraft was prepared for landing on runway 13. In the final approach, the landing configuration was then established and the landing checklist performed. The copilot reported that shortly before the landing the speed decreased, the aircraft flew too low and the approach angle had to be corrected. He pushed the engine thrust levers forward to the stop. The pilot in command supported this action by also pushing the engine thrust levers forward with his hand. However, according to the pilot in command, the remaining time to touch down on the runway was no longer sufficient for the engines to accelerate to maximum speed in order to deliver the corresponding thrust. He also described that the aircraft had been in the stall area at that time. However, he had not noticed a stall warning. At 14:42, with the landing gear extended, the aircraft touched down in the grass in front of the asphalt area of runway 13. The left main landing gear buckled and damaged the tank of the left wing. The right main landing gear also buckled, the tank on the right side remained undamaged. The kerosene escaping from the left wing ignited and a fire broke out. The aircraft burned and slipped along runway 13 on the folded landing gear, the underside of the airframe and the extended landing flaps until it came to a standstill after a distance of approx. 730 m from runway threshold 13. After the plane had come to a standstill on the runway, the copilot noticed flames on the left side of the plane. The pilot switched off both engines. Then both pilots left the plane via the emergency exit door on the right side. The pilots were not injured. Conclusions: The accident, in which the aircraft touched down in front of the runway threshold, was due to an unstabilized approach and failure to initiate a go around maneuver. The following factors contributed to the accident: - The formation of the aerodrome circuit was too close to the airfield. - The final approach was flown too short and performed in a manner that resulted in an unstabilized approach. - During the final approach, the approach angle was not maintained correctly to the runway threshold. - The airspeed on final approach was too low. - Both pilots had not recognized the speed drop early enough and had not increased the engine power in time. - The flight instructor had intervened too late and thus the aircraft attitude was not brought under control in time. An additional contributing factor was the rising terrain ahead of the runway threshold. The student pilot most likely had the impression of being too high and deliberately kept the approach angle flat.METAR: 11:20 UTC / 13:20 local time: EDGS 241120Z 22006KT 110V240 9999 FEW048 19/07 Q100312:20 UTC / 14:20 local time: EDGS 241220Z 22006KT 100V240 CAVOK 21/08 Q100313:20 UTC / 15:20 local time: EDGS 241320Z 15007KT 110V200 CAVOK 20/08 Q1002Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BFU Report number: BFU19-0411-3X Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Fahrwerk beim Landeanflug abgerissen: Kleiner Jet fÃ¤ngt am Siegerland-Flughafen Feuer (wa.de, 24-4-2019)  Video Â Cessna geht nach Bruchlandung in Flammen auf (wirsiegen.de, 24-4-2019)  Flightradar24 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  5 October 2008 D-IADV Advance Air (AXX) 0 Sylt Airport (GWT/EDXW) sub Location  Images: photo (c) Alec Wilson; Birmingham International Airport (BHX/EGBB); 24 May 2013; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The reported Runway Visual Range (RVR) was 300 to 325 m. EI-SEV arrived from Stansted Airport (STN) and landed on runway 27 before following taxiway Alpha eastwards to the Central Apron. Due to the poor weather and their elevated position in the control tower, air traffic controllers could not see the aircraft, taxiway or apron. G-GDFB was not painting on the ControllersÂ Surface Movement Radar (SMR) display. With no other information about stand occupancy available to them, ATC were unaware that S24 was occupied. Accordingly, the ground movements controller cleared EI-SEV to taxi the shortest route to S22 which was via Quebec (Q), the western entry point to the apron.

The reported Runway Visual Range (RVR) was 300 to 325 m. EI-SEV arrived from Stansted Airport (STN) and landed on runway 27 before following taxiway Alpha eastwards to the Central Apron. Due to the poor weather and their elevated position in the control tower, air traffic controllers could not see the aircraft, taxiway or apron. G-GDFB was not painting on the ControllersÂ Surface Movement Radar (SMR) display. With no other information about stand occupancy available to them, ATC were unaware that S24 was occupied. Accordingly, the ground movements controller cleared EI-SEV to taxi the shortest route to S22 which was via Quebec (Q), the western entry point to the apron.

After departure, while the aircraft was climbing through 1200 feet above sea level on the way to a cruising altitude of 5000 feet, the flight crew completed the after-takeoff checklist and applied carburetor heat to 20 Â°C. While the First Officer (FO) was applying the carburetor heat, oil pressure was observed decreasing on the left engine (Pratt & Whitney R-1830-92). Moments later, rising cylinder head temperature and oil temperature indications were also observed on the left engine. The captain directed the FO to contact the area control centre to declare a PAN PAN emergency and request a return to CYHY, which the FO then did. The aircraft flight manual (AFM) does not contain any procedures for abnormal engine indications. As the aircraft reached an altitude of 1969 feet, the captain set the left engine to a reduced power setting and increased the power on the right engine to maximum except takeoff (METO) power. The flight crew began to set up for an instrument landing system approach to CYHY via TANPO. At 07:47, while the aircraft was in a right turn proceeding towards TANPO, smoke and oil were observed, and abnormal sounds were heard coming from the left engine. Using the engine failure checklist, the flight crew then shut down the left engine and feathered the propeller. At 07:48, because the situation had escalated, a MAYDAY emergency was declared. Moments later, the flight crew completed the descent checklist and initiated the approach checklist. However, due to the escalating emergency, the flight crew was not able to complete the approach checklist, which included the landing briefing. At 07:53, the aircraft levelled off at 1214 feet. The FO observed zero hydraulic pressure on the landing gear DOWN gauge. Thinking this zero pressure was an issue, he mentioned it to the captain, who then directed the FO to ""prep the gear."" The FO extended the landing gear, which the captain did not expect because the aircraft had not started its final approach and the airport had not been visually acquired. At 07:55, as the aircraft continued towards TANPO, the altitude was between 1200 and 1300 feet ASL, and the airspeed was maintained at approximately 100 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS). When the aircraft was abeam TANPO, the captain began a right turn to intercept the localizer for the final approach. The aircraftÂs airspeed decreased from 100 KIAS to 80 KIAS, while its altitude decreased to 1100 feet ASL. With the reduced airspeed, the aircraftÂs flight control response became sluggish and the captain directed the landing gear to be raised. After the landing gear was raised, at 07:59, the flight crew heard abnormal sounds and felt vibrations from the right engine. The aircraftÂs airspeed was 80 KIAS, and its altitude began to decrease to below 800 feet ASL.   In an attempt to maintain altitude, the right engine was increased to maximum takeoff power, but this had no effect. The flight crew then prepared for an emergency gear-up landing, and the aircraftÂs flaps were lowered on short final to reduce speed for touchdown. At 08:01, the aircraft landed in muskeg on KÂatlÂOdeeche First Nation land, approximately 3.5 nautical miles southeast of CYHY. After the aircraft came to a stop, the FO exited the aircraft through the right-hand crew window, while the captain remained in the cockpit to secure the right engine and aircraft systems before evacuating via the forward door. The FO contacted the flight information centre to notify them of the crewÂs status and aircraft location. The emergency locator transmitter had not activated during the forced landing, so the FO activated it manually to assist search and rescue in locating the aircraft. The flight crew was uninjured. The aircraft received substantial damage. There was no post-impact fire. First responders arrived at the accident site at 11:14 In this occurrence, the aircraftÂs airspeed and altitude could not be maintained, primarily because of the increased drag when the landing gear was extended early in the approach.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A19W0052 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: cabinradio.ca  cbc.ca   Location  Images: photo (c) TSB Canada; near Hay River Airport, NT (YHY); May 2019; (CC:by-nc-nd) photo (c) TSB Canada; near Hay River Airport, NT (YHY); May 2019; (CC:by-nc-nd) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane came to rest in the shallow waters of St. Johns River, sustaining substantial damage. The 143 passengers and crew survived. The aircraft was engaged in a charter flight to bring military personnel and family members home. The No. 1 (left) thrust reverser was not operational and deferred for the flight in accordance with the airplaneÂs minimum equipment list. The captain was the pilot flying for the accident flight, and the first officer was the pilot monitoring. The captain was also performing check airman duties for the first officer who was in the process of completing operating experience training. Flight 293 departed GuantÃ¡namo Bay at 23:19 UTC. At 21:22 local time the pilot checked in with a Jacksonville approach (JAX) controller while level at 13,000 ft mean sea level and was provided the JAX altimeter setting; the controller advised the pilot to expect the RNAV runway 28 approach and moderate-to-heavy precipitation on the final approach to runway 28 (9000 ft/2743 m long). At 21:23, the JAX controller advised the pilot that the winds at KNIP were from 350Â° at 4 knots; the pilot then asked if there was any chance of getting runway 10 because it looked a little better. The JAX controller responded that he was showing moderate-to-heavy precipitation building over runway 10 starting about 5 miles on final. The pilot acknowledged and said he would stick with runway 28.  He was then instructed to descend and maintain 5,000 ft. At 21:25, the controller provided additional weather information to the flight crew, stating that moderate-to-heavy precipitation was present east and west of the airport. The pilot elected to continue for an approach to runway 28. At 21:30, the JAX controller advised the pilot that the flight was heading northbound and the precipitation was moving eastbound; the controller then asked the pilot if he would like to try runway 10 since it might be better. The pilot acknowledged ""yeah go ahead, letÂs do it."" The controller then instructed the pilot to turn left to a heading of 270Â°, and the pilot acknowledged.   Over the next several minutes, the flight was vectored for the approach to runway 10. At 21:37, the JAX controller cleared the flight for the RNAV runway 10 approach, and the pilot acknowledged.  Shortly after, the flight was transferred to the KNIP radar controller. The pilot contacted the KNIP radar controller, and, at 21:39, the KNIP radar controller indicated the winds were from 240Â° at 10 knots; he then cleared the flight to land on runway 10.  As the airplane descended through 1,390 ft mean sea level (msl), the pilots configured it for landing with the flaps set at 30Â° and the landing gear extended; however, the speedbrake handle was not placed in the armed position as specified in the Landing checklist. At an altitude of about 1,100 ft msl and 2.8 nm from the runway, the airplane was slightly above the glidepath, and its airspeed was on target. Over the next minute, the indicated airspeed increased to 170 knots (17 knots above the target approach speed), and groundspeed reached 180 knots, including an estimated 7-knot tailwind. At an altitude of about 680 ft msl and 1.6 nm from the threshold, the airplane deviated further above the 3Â° glidepath such that the precision approach path indicator (PAPI) lights would have appeared to the flight crew as four white lights and would retain that appearance throughout the rest of the approach. Eight seconds before touchdown, multiple enhanced ground proximity warning system alerts announced ""sink rate"" as the airplaneÂs descent rate peaked at 1,580 fpm. The airplane crossed the displaced threshold 120 ft above the runway and 17 knots above the target approach speed, with a groundspeed of 180 knots and a rate of descent about 1,450 ft per minute (fpm). The airplane touched down about 1,580 ft beyond the displaced threshold, which was 80 ft beyond the designated touchdown zone as specified in the operatorÂs standard operating procedures (SOP). After touchdown, the captain deployed the No. 2 engine thrust reverser and began braking; he later reported, however, that he did not feel the aircraft decelerate and increased the brake pressure. The speedbrakes deployed about 4 seconds after touchdown, most likely triggered by the movement of the right throttle into the idle reverse thrust detent after main gear tire spinup. The automatic deployment of the speedbrakes was likely delayed by about 3 seconds compared to the automatic deployment that could have been obtained by arming the speedbrakes before landing. The airplane crossed the end of the runway about 55 ft right of the centerline and impacted a seawall 90 ft to the right of the centerline, 9,170 ft beyond the displaced threshold, and 1,164 ft beyond the departure end of runway 10. After the airplane came to rest in St. Johns River, the flight crew began an emergency evacuation. The airplane was mostly intact, but both main landing gear had separated from the airplane and were also located in the river. Probable Cause and Findings An extreme loss of braking friction due to heavy rain and the water depth on the ungrooved runway, which resulted in viscous hydroplaning. Contributing to the accident was the operatorÂs inadequate guidance for evaluating runway braking conditions and conducting en route landing distance assessments. Contributing to the continuation of an unstabilized approach were 1) the captainÂs plan continuation bias and increased workload due to the weather and performing check airman duties and 2) the first officerÂs lack of experience.METAR: 01:05 UTC / 21:05 local time: KNIP 040105Z COR 08003KT 10SM -TSRA SCT008 BKN030CB BKN045 BKN250 25/23 A2997 RMK AO2 TSB04 OCNL LTGIC VC W TS W MOV E T1 SET P0000 T02500228 $01:22 UTC / 21:22 local time: KNIP 040122Z 35004KT 5SM +TSRA BR SCT008 BKN018CB OVC030 24/22 A2998 RMK AO2 TSB04 FRQ LTGIC OHD TS OHD MOV E T1 SET P0010 T02440222 $01:45 UTC / 21:45 local time: KNIP 040145Z 29008G16KT 3SM +TSRA BR SCT008 BKN015CB OVC032 24/22 A2999 RMK AO2 TSB04 FRQ LTGIC OHD TS OHD MOV E T1 SET P0063 T02440222 $01:53 UTC / 21:53 local time: KNIP 040153Z 13003KT 2SM +TSRA BR SCT010 BKN021CB OVC035 23/21 A2998 RMK AO2 TSB04 SLP149 FRQ LTGIC OHD TS OHD MOV E T1 SET P0074 T02280206 $Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA19FA143 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Flightaware track  NTSB History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  27 September 2012 N732MA Miami Air International 0 Concord Regional Airport, NC (KJQF) non Taxiway excursion Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Jacksonville Naval Air Station, FL (NIP); 04 May 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Jacksonville Naval Air Station, FL (NIP); 04 May 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Jacksonville Naval Air Station, FL (NIP); May 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Jacksonville Naval Air Station, FL (NIP); May 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Jacksonville Naval Air Station, FL (NIP); May 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) Jaime Escobar Corradine; Miami International Airport, FL (MIA/KMIA); 14 January 2011 photo (c) Victor Vu; Columbia Regional Airport, MO (COU/KCOU); 18 November 2016 photo (c) Harro Ranter/ASN; Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS/EHAM); 30 August 2016 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft was chartered to fly passengers from Monterrey to Las Vegas to visit a boxing match. At 14:52 hours local time (21:52 UTC) the aircraft took off from Las Vegas on the return leg to Monterrey. The planned flight time was two hours and thirty minutes. At 23:24 UTC, the flight contacted Monterrey ACC, requesting permission to climb to FL390. This was approved. Nine minutes later the aircraft entered the green zone of the weather system that was ahead. This caused an increase in turbulence with vertical acceleration values of between 1.40 and 0.68 g. The crew then requested to climb to FL410, which was the maximum certified operating altitude for the aircraft. This request was also approved by Monterrey ACC. At 23:37:00 UTC, the aircraft entered the core of the most intense part of the weather system. The turbulence began to become more severe. The aircraft became almost weightless, registering 0.04g followed immediately by a positive load of 1.52 g. The roll attitude oscillated from left to right with magnitudes up to 18 degrees. These conditions continued for the next sixteen seconds, during which time, the aircraft continued to climb on the same heading. At 23:37:18 UTC, the aircraft encountered a massive disturbance in the air mass that produced a negative vertical acceleration of -1.98 g, followed by +2.40g. This encounter lasted almost three seconds. The aircraft then encountered another massive disturbance, causing loads of -1.88g, followed by a sustained load in excess of 2.74 g. Four seconds after this encounter, the aircraft reached a right roll of 90 degrees and the altitude rapidly climbed to FL425. At this point the aircraft was out of control. At 23:37:27 UTC, the aircraft's altitude excursion peaked at FL448. At this point, the aircraft was inverted and banked sixty degrees, nose down. It began a rapid descent, while rolling wings level. At 23:37:31 UTC, the aircraft rolled inverted once again with a high rate of roll and continued to descend rapidly through FL404 in a flat spin.  It then impacted terrain at an elevation of 1088 m. Probable Cause: ""Impact with terrain with wings level, after a loss of control due to rapid climb and inversion of the aircraft caused by entry into severe atmospheric instability, inducing both engines to shut down"". Contributing Factors: - Inadvertent entry into severe atmospheric instability zone. - Not having the necessary information from the aircraft's weather radar system for undetermined reasons.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIDAIA Mexico Report number: ACCDTAFA019/2019MMMV Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: jornada.com.mx  Flightaware track log  eldiariodecoahuila.com.mx   Location  Images: photo (c) Darrell Sodergren; Teterboro Airport, NJ (TEB/KTEB); 04 January 2014 photo (c) Darrell Sodergren; London-Luton Airport (LTN/EGGW); 20 October 2010 photo (c) Darrell Sodergren; Farnborough Airport (FAB/EGLF); 06 March 2013 photo (c) Darrell Sodergren; Opa-locka Airport, FL (OPF/KOPF); 27 November 2010 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Of the 78 persons on board, 41 did not survive. The aircraft took off from Sheremetyevo Airport's runway 24C at 18:03 hours local time on a scheduled service to Murmansk, Russia. Visibility was fine but there were some Cumulonimbus clouds near the airfield at 6000 feet. The flight crew engaged the autopilot as the aircraft climbed through a height of 700 ft (215 m). At 18:08, as the aircraft was climbing through an altitude of about 8900 ft (2700 m), a failure occurred in the electrical system. At this point, the aircraft was 30 km west-northwest of the airport in an area of thunderstorm activity. The captain assumed manual control of the aircraft and the crew managed to establish radio contact using UHF. The flight was not able to contact the approach controller and subsequently selected the emergency transponder code 7600 (loss of radio communication). About 18:17 the aircraft overshot the runway centreline after turning to runway heading. Altitude at that time was about 2400 feet. The aircraft continued the right-hand turn, completed a circle and proceeded on the final approach for runway 24L. Flaps were selected at 25Â°, which was the recommended setting for landing above maximum landing weight. At 18:26 the flight crew selected the emergency transponder code 7700 (emergency). When descending from 335 to 275 m (1100-900 ft) the windshear warning system sounded five times: ""Go around. Windshear ahead"". From a height of 80 m (260 ft) above ground level, the aircraft descended below the glide path and at a height of 55 m (180 ft) the TAWS warning sounded: ""Glide Slope."" From that moment on the airspeed increased to 170 knots. At 18:30 the aircraft overflew the runway threshold and touched down at a distance of 900 m past the threshold at a speed of 158 knots. Touchdown occurred at a g-force of at least 2.55g with a subsequent bounce to a height of about 2 m. After two seconds the aircraft landed again on the nose landing gear with a vertical load 5.85g, and bounced to a height of 6 m. The third landing of the aircraft occurred at a speed of 140 knots with a vertical overload of at least 5g. This caused a rupture of the wing structure and fuel lines. Flames erupted and engulfed the rear of the aircraft. The aircraft slid to a stop on the grass between runway 24L and two taxiways. An emergency evacuation was then carried out while flames quickly engulfed the rear fuselage.METAR: 15:00 UTC / 18:00 local time: UUEE 051500Z 14003G08MPS 9999 FEW060CB 17/13 Q1012 R24L/290045 R24C/290045 NOSIG15:30 UTC / 18:30 local time: UUEE 051530Z 17007MPS 9999 SCT060CB 17/11 Q1012 R24L/290045 R24C/290045 NOSIG16:00 UTC / 19:00 local time: UUEE 051600Z 16004MPS 9999 -SHRA SCT055CB 16/11 Q1012 R24L/290045 R24C/290045 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number:  Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: Russian Ministry of Transport  TASS   Location  Images: photo (c) Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation; Moskva-Sheremetyevo Airport (SVO); 05 May 2019 photo (c) Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation; Moskva-Sheremetyevo Airport (SVO); 05 May 2019 photo (c) Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation; Moskva-Sheremetyevo Airport (SVO); 05 May 2019 photo (c) Flightradar24; Moskva-Sheremetyevo Airport (SVO); 05 May 2019 photo (c) Flightaware.com; Moskva-Sheremetyevo Airport (SVO); 05 May 2019 photo (c) Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation; Moskva-Sheremetyevo Airport (SVO); 05 May 2019 photo (c) Anna Zvereva; Tallinn-Ãlemiste Airport (TLL/EETN); 06 October 2017; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) Miklos Szabo; Budapest Ferenc Liszt International Airport (BUD/LHBP); 16 May 2018; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates09-Oct-2024 13:56 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft departed Dhaka-Shahjalal International Airport, Bangladesh, as Biman flight 060 about 15:15 hours local time with destination Yangon-Mingaladon Airport in Myanmar. Weather at Yangon was poor due to the presence of a thunderstorm in the area.  While the flight crew was performing an ILS approach, the controller instructed them to go around as the airport was closed due to weather. When the weather condition got better, the flight was cleared for an RNP approach to runway 21 because only the localizer was available at that moment. The co-pilot was Pilot Flying and the captain was Pilot Monitoring. The aircraft was higher than the 3 degree approach path and the airspeed fluctuated between 136 and 151 kts, which was than the 122 kts target airspeed. The captain said ""continue, continue"" to the copilot and the approach was continued. At an altitude of 22 feet over the runway, the captain began pushing the control column forward, while the PF was attempting to pull on the control column. At 1828 m down the runway, with 1585 m remaining, the aircraft briefly skipped a few times before getting airborne again. The captain then stated: ""I have control"", which was confirmed by the co-pilot. While in the air, the captain applied the brake pedal several times. At a height of 44 feet, the captain put the propellers in beta range and reduced the power lever angle to 18 degrees. The aircraft sank again and collided with runway 03 and slid forward. It left the runway and came to a complete stop in the over-run area. The aircraft fuselage broke in just behind the forward passenger door and just behind the rear service door. The undercarriage collapsed and the right hand wing broke at the attachment point with the fuselage. There was no fire. All occupants survived, but twelve suffered serious injuries.

The five occupants of the DHC-2 sustained fatal injuries. The DHC-3 pilot sustained minor injuries, nine passengers sustained serious injuries, and one passenger sustained fatal injuries.  The purpose of both flights was to transport passengers to Ketchikan from the Misty Fjords National Monument area in Alaska, USA. Both flights were converging on a scenic waterfall before returning to the Ketchikan Harbor Seaplane Base. At 12:17:15, the DHC-3 was about level at 4,000 ft mean sea level (msl) on a track of 225Â°, and the DHC-2 was 4.2 nautical miles south of the DHC-3, climbing through 2,800 ft msl, on a track of 255Â°. About 12:19, the DHC-3 started a descent from 4,000 ft msl, and the DHC-2 was at 3,175 ft msl and climbing. During the next 1 minute 21 seconds, the DHC-3 continued to descend on a track between 224Â° and 237Â°, and the DHC-2 leveled out at 3,350 ft msl on a track of about 255Â°. The airplanes collided at 12:21:14 at an altitude of 3,350 ft msl, 7.4 nm northeast of Ketchikan Harbor. The DHC-3 pilot stated to the NTSB that the flight from the Misty Fjords area had proceeded normally, and he had descended and was maneuvering the airplane to show passengers a waterfall near Mahoney Lake when the collision occurred. Just prior to the collision, he saw a flash from his left side, and experienced a large, loud impact. According to the pilot, the DHC-3 airplane then rolled right and pitched about 40 degrees nose down toward the water in George Inlet. The pilot stated that he was able to maintain some control and flare the airplane prior to impact. The pilot, some passengers, and some bystanders helped the passengers of the DHC-3 evacuate the airplane and move to the shore. The DHC-3 main wreckage came to rest about 80 ft underwater about 400 ft off the east shore of George Inlet. The DHC-2 airplane broke up in-flight after the collision, and the wreckage was scattered over water and mountainous tree-covered terrain northeast of Mahoney Lake on the west shore of George Inlet. Both aircraft were ADS-B-equipped and both pilots were presented with visual traffic information through the iPad with ForeFlight app (DHC-2) and Chelton display (DHC-3). However, the Garmin GSL 71 on the DHC-3 had been turned off, causing pressure altitude of the airplane not to be transmitted with the ADS-B data. Thus, both systems were not able to generate warnings of potential conflicts. Additionally, the DHC-2 was obscured from the Otter pilot's vision by the window frame until the very last moment. The Beaver pilot likely was unable to see the Otter approaching from behind due to the aircraft structure and the passenger seated on his right. Probable Cause: The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the inherent limitations of the see-and-avoid concept, which prevented the two pilots from seeing the other airplane before the collision, and the absence of visual and aural alerts from both airplanesÂ traffic display systems, while operating in a geographic area with a high concentration of air tour activity. Contributing to the accident were (1) the Federal Aviation AdministrationÂs provision of new transceivers that lacked alerting capability to Capstone Program operators without adequately mitigating the increased risk associated with the consequent loss of the previously available alerting capability and (2) the absence of a requirement for airborne traffic advisory systems with aural alerting among operators who carry passengers for hire.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: AAR-21-04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources: KTUU.com  KTVA.com  ADN.com  Coast Guard statement   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Ketchikan, AK; 13 May 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) John Olafson; Ketchikan, AK; 02 July 2013 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane was owned and operated by the pilot as an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight when the accident occurred. The pilot and the sole passenger were fatally injured and the airplane was destroyed. The flight departed MQJ about 1243 destined for Minden-Tahoe Airport (MEV), Nevada. Radar data depicted the airplane departing from runway 7 at MQJ. Shortly after departure, the airplane began a left turn towards an air traffic control (ATC) assigned heading of 320Â°. After reaching an altitude of about 1,400 ft MSL, the airplane descended until it disappeared from the radar. A witness on the ground at MQJ reported seeing the airplane in an estimated 90Â° left bank with the nose parallel to the horizon shortly after departure. He observed the airplane's nose lower slightly before rising again to a level attitude. At no point did he observe the nose of the airplane rise above the horizon. The nose of the airplane again lowered and the airplane impacted the ground. The airplane impacted a flooded cornfield and exhibited significant fragmentation. The wreckage and debris field covered an area of about 270 ft long and 103 ft wide. The initial ground scar was aligned on about a 327Â° magnetic heading (MH). The nose of the airplane came to rest on a 268Â° MH and the tail came to rest on a 182Â° MH. Both engines separated from the airplane and were located about 197 ft from the point of initial impact, roughly aligned with the ground scar. A post-impact fire incinerated about 80% of the airplane.

The aircraft came to rest in trees. The cause of the accident with the An-2 RA-68161 aircraft was a drop in engine power during takeoff, which led to the need for a forced landing immediately after the aircraft took off, as a result of which a rolling out of the runway occurred with a subsequent collision with the trees of the forest belt. The drop in engine power was due to the destruction of the exhaust manifold flame tubes, which led to a loss of engine power on takeoff due to the ingress of exhaust gases into the carburetor through an open choke. The destruction of fragments of the exhaust manifold flame tubes occurred as a result of overheating of the material during operation. Contributing factors are most likely to be: - shortcomings in the technical operation of the aircraft: flight operations over a long period of time without taking into account the engine operating time and without obtaining the Airworthiness Certificate (without carrying out the work necessary to obtain it); - lack of sufficient distance to safely end the takeoff.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: MAK  Russian Emergency Situations Ministry   Location  Images: photo (c) Ministry of Emergency Situations in the Stavropol Territory; Zhuravskoye; 22 May 2019 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot was not found and presumed fatally injured. According to the owner of the airplane, he purchased the airplane two days prior to the accident. The airplane had recently undergone a progressive inspection, which was completed on May 22, 2019. The owner then hired a contract pilot to fly the airplane to Fort Lauderdale-Executive Airport (FXE) to have some avionics work done.  The aircraft departed St. Louis Regional Airport, Illinois, USA at 18:36 UTC (13:36 local time) on the flight to FXE. The aircraft climbed to the cruising altitude of FL390.  The pilot established communications with the Atlanta Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) and reported he was level at FL390, and that the air was smooth. Later, the air traffic controller tried to communicate with the pilot to tell him to contact the Jacksonville ARTCC, but the controller was unable to make contact with the pilot. The controller made several attempts to contact the pilot on different radio frequencies, to no avail. The controller then advised Jacksonville ARTCC that communications with the flight had been lost. The Jacksonville controllers then continued to monitor the flight via radar. The flight transitioned through Jacksonville and Miami ARTCC airspace without any radio contact. The US Air Force dispatched two Homestead AFRES F-15 aircraft to intercept the accident airplane. One of the interceptor pilots reported that he could see the pilot unconscious and slumped over the controls. The intercept airplanes followed the accident airplane until it descended and impacted the Atlantic Ocean about 310 miles east of FXE.

Of the 128 passengers and crew onboard, one flight attendant sustained serious injuries and one flight attendant sustained minor injuries. The airplane was not damaged. The flight was operating under 14 CFR Part 121 as a regularly scheduled passenger flight from Chicago Midway International Airport (KMDW), Chicago, Illinois, to KJAX. According to the captain, as the flight approached 15,000 feet, he noticed there was a scattered layer of clouds they needed to descend through, and so he elected to provide the 10,000-foot chime to the flight attendants early. As the flight descended through the layer at about 12,000 feet, the airplane encountered moderate turbulence. The seat belt sign was off, and the flight crew had turned off the weather radar about 5 minutes before because they had observed no weather between the airplane and KJAX.  According to the flight attendants (FA), the turbulence was encountered shortly after they received the 10,000-foot chime and begun their final walkthrough of the cabin. The two FAs in the aft cabin were thrown into the air and then struck the floor. One of the injured FAs was transferred to a passenger seat for the remainder of the flight. The flight crew was notified of the injury, who requested that paramedics meet the airplane at the gate. After landing, the two aft FAs were transported to the hospital where one was diagnosed with a fractured ankle. Post accident examination of the weather data determined that the turbulence was encountered in the vicinity of the sea breeze front and localized convergence where towering cumulus clouds (cumulus congestus clouds) were depicted on the satellite imagery. There was no lightning detected, pilot reports (PIREPs), or inflight advisories for convection or turbulence current for the area.   Probable Cause: an encounter with convectively induced turbulence while penetrating cumulus clouds during descent.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA19CA151 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA19CA151  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

At 1842 UTC (0242 LT), at night, the aircraft commenced pushback from stand B1. The push back operation used a towing tractor with the three crew members consisting of a towing tractor driver, a wing-man and a headset-man, a task performed by an aircraft mechanic. There was no briefing among the crew related to the pushback activity including the push back maneuver. The towing tractor driver and wing-man used high visibility vest while the headset-man used company uniform without any fluorescence strip or high visibility vest. The push back maneuver did not follow the guideline and the headset-man walked behind the nose wheel while observing the engine start process. During a turn, the aircraft nose wheel passed over the right foot of the headset-man. The towing tractor driver felt a bump and noticed that the headset-man laid on the ground. The headset-man was evacuated to the nearest hospital for medical treatment and found to have sustainied a fracture on his right tarsometatarsal. Contributing factors of the occurrence: The different assumption of pushback maneuver between headset-man and the push back tractor driver, and both were fixated to their own duties while working on a reduced alertness condition, resulted in the towing tractor driver did not aware of the headset-man position and the headset-man did not aware of the nose wheel position.

The flight crew comprised the captain (Pilot Flying, PF) and the co-pilot (Pilot Not Flying, PNF). Also, a ground engineer was on board. The purpose was to ferry the aircraft to Savonlinna to restart scheduled flights between Savonlinna and Helsinki-Vantaa.  The runway at Savonlinna was cleared from snow but there was packed snow at the edges. Because snow kept falling, the runway condition was considered 'poor', which was reported to the arriving aircraft. At 05:43 the captain reported being established on the ILS localiser. The AFIS officer reported that wind was 220 degrees at five knots and that runway 12 was free. The pilots used 20 degrees flap during the approach. According to the flight data recorder the approach was stable until the threshold. During the final approach the pilots saw the approach and runway lights well. Owing to the icing conditions they intended to use an airspeed which was 10 knots higher than the Aircraft Operations ManualÂs prescribed minimum approach speed. At the threshold their speed was 126 knots, while the approachÂs target speed was 120 knots. However, the airspeed at the touchdown zone markings was 123 knots. Contrasting from normal, the aircraft floated close to the surface for 6-7 seconds before touching down. The flight crew did not consider aborting the landing. Following the level flight the captain steered the aircraft toward the ground at a fairly high vertical speed. The aircraft touched down at 05:50, approximately 307 metres after the optimal touchdown point, on the left side of the runway. At touchdown the airspeed was 109 knots, which corresponds to the 110 knot target speed. Judging by the marks on the snow the left main landing gear hit the left snowbank on the uncleared area. The nose gear touched the runway, following which the left main gear became airborne for a moment and the right main gear touched the ground. The left main gear touched down again. After having travelled approximately 100 metres from the first touchdown point the aircraftÂs nose gear and the right main landing gear moved outside the cleared runway area. The aircraft was tracking towards the left, away from the direction of the runway. The pilots tried to turn the aircraft back towards the runway centreline. According to the markings the aircraft began to turn and started to skid sideways outside the cleared area of the runway. When the left main gear hit a high snowbank outside the runway, the aircraft began to turn more sharply to the left. The left engine stalled when snow entered its air intake. The pilots did not deploy reverse thrust. The right main gear knocked one runway edge light over. The aircraft stopped in half-metre deep snow outside the runway, at a 110 degree angle in relation to runway 12. The accident caused considerable damage to the aircraft. Both of the aircraftÂs propellers were damaged as well as the nose landing gear. The Safety Investigation Authority stated that this accident demonstrated the fact that the operating licences and air operator licences issued by the EU Member StatesÂ aviation authorities do not guarantee constant and uniform safety levels among air carriers. While the EUÂs regulations have aimed at ensuring the most open participation in tendering, they may result in overlooking the safety of aviation as one criterion in tendering. The purchaser organising the public tender for air services will not necessarily impose any safety-associated criteria because of being cautious about breaking EU competition rules and the court processes launched by losing bidders. Often the price and on-time performance are the tender criteria. Purchasers of air services do not have suitable and straightforward indicators to assess air carrier safety. Clients and purchasers may also include those that are not deeply familiar with the aviation branch. CONCLUSIONS 1.

Clients and purchasers may also include those that are not deeply familiar with the aviation branch. 5. The airline had not completely complied with its own safety management system. Oversight authorities do not always detect the difference between the safety management that operators promise to follow and their real-world practices. 6. At no time did the flight crew consider aborting the landing. 7. The airlineÂs operational manuals (OM-A and OM-B) were inconsistent concerning maximum crosswind components. The instructions were difficult to follow in practice. 8. Regardless of the alert to the Emergency Response Centre, no information about the airliner accident was relayed to the regionÂs divisional officer on duty because, owing to the situation assessment, there was no need to deploy rescue service units. 9. The Cockpit Voice Recorder had not recorded anything from the flight in question, and the earlier recordings that were retrieved from its memory were of extremely poor quality. The recording quality of the FDR, when compared to modern recorders, was poor. The magnetic tape of the FDR was worn, which caused defects in the recording.METAR: 03:20 UTC / 05:20 local time: EFSA 070320Z 21004KT 180V260 3000 -SN BKN006 OVC017 M02/M02 Q101103:50 UTC / 05:50 local time: EFSA 070350Z 22005KT 170V260 2500 SN BKN005 OVC015 M02/M02 Q101004:50 UTC / 06:50 local time: EFSA 070450Z AUTO 23005KT 180V270 4300 -SN OVC006 M01/M02 Q1010Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: SIAF Report number: L2019-01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) Safety Investigation Authority Finland; Savonlinna Airport (SVL/EFSA); January 2019 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The captain, first officer flight attendant, and 6 passengers on board were not injured and the airplane sustained substantial damage.  As the airplane arrived in the Uvalde area, ARTCC cleared the airplane to descend to 4,000 ft. After leveling off at 4,000 ft, the flight crew canceled their IFR clearance and proceeded to the airport visually. The pilot flew over the runway and entered a left downwind visual traffic pattern to see if there were any animals on the runway and what the windsock on the airport indicated. The pilot stated that they did not see the windsock as they passed over the runway.  There were no animals on the runway, but the air was turbulent. The flight crew called their downwind and base legs over the airport's common frequency. On base leg, the pilot had the copilot set the flaps to 30Â°. As the pilot turned the airplane onto the final approach for landing, the copilot lowered the landing gear. The airplane was 4.5 miles from the end of the runway at 2,500 ft agl and an airspeed of 170 kts. The copilot completed the ""Before Landing"" checklist. The pilot confirmed the thrust reversers were armed and called for the flaps to be set to 45Â°. At 2 miles from the end of the runway, the pilot checked his approach speed and confirmed the landing gear was down. The pilot reported there was turbulence and wind gusts from the hills below and to the west of them. As they passed 50 ft. and coming over the runway, the pilot reduced engine power to idle. The pilot reported they then encountered a windshear. Their airspeed dropped rapidly and the airplane ""was forced down"" to the runway. The pilot unlocked the thrust reversers, applied brakes, and reached to deploy the ground spoilers. As he deployed the thrust reversers, the pilot said it felt like the right landing gear collapsed. He applied full nose-left rudder and left-wing-down aileron, but the airplane continued to veer to the right. The pilot tried using the tiller to steer to the left with no response. The airplane exited the side of the runway and went into the grass. A representative for the airport reported that the airplane on landing hit hard. About two thirds of the way down runway 35, the airplane slid off the right side of the runway. The airplane proceeded through a ditch and struck a perimeter fence before coming to a stop. Probable cause: ""The airplane's encounter with wind shear on short final approach to the runway, which resulted in a hard landing and fracture of the right main landing gear.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN19LA054 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Uvalde-Ox Ranch Airport, TX; 12 January 2019 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The captain and first officer were fatally injured and the airplane sustained substantial damage. The airplane was registered to Priority Air Charter LLC and operated by AFM Hardware Inc. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the positioning flight, which was destined for Akron-Canton Regional Airport (CAK), North Canton, Ohio. The airplane was part of a test program for new, higher horsepower engine installation. Soon after liftoff and about 3 seconds after decision speed (V1), the left engine lost total power. The propeller began to auto-feather but stopped feathering about 3 seconds after the power loss. The airplane yawed and banked to the left, descended, and impacted terrain. The airplane struck power lines and trees before impacting the ground and came to rest about 200 yards from the end of runway 19. The main wreckage was upright and oriented on a northwesterly heading, with the fuselage separated forward of the wings. The left wing was broken aft and upward and the inboard leading edge of the right wing was crushed aft. The left engine was broken aft and outboard of the wing's leading edge. The right engine was broken downward at the nacelle. The nose of the airplane was located forward and left of the airplane main wreckage. Recorded engine data indicated the power loss was due to an engine flameout; however, examination of the engine did not determine a reason for the flameout or the auto-feather system interruption. While it is plausible that an air pocket developed in the fuel system during the refueling just before the flight, this scenario was not able to be tested or confirmed. It is possible that the auto-feather system interruption would have occurred if the left power lever was manually retarded during the auto-feather sequence.  The power loss and auto-feather system interruption occurred during a critical, time-sensitive phase of flight since the airplane was at low altitude and below minimum controllable airspeed (Vmc). The acutely transitional phase of flight would have challenged the pilots' ability to manually feather the propeller quickly and accurately. The time available for the crew to respond to the unexpected event was likely less than needed to recognize the problem and take this necessary action Â even as an immediate action checklist/memory item. Probable cause: The loss of airplane control after an engine flameout and auto-feather system interruption during the takeoff climb, which resulted in an impact with terrain.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN19LA056 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: news5cleveland.com  Flightaware.com  indeonline.com  NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Kidron-Stoltzfus Airfield, OH; January 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Kidron-Stoltzfus Airfield, OH; January 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Kidron-Stoltzfus Airfield, OH; January 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Kidron-Stoltzfus Airfield, OH; January 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) David Overmire; Liverpool International Airport (LPL/EGGP); 30 October 2016 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

During the take-off run from runway 26 at CYUY, the aircraft began to veer to the left.  It continued to do so until the left main landing gear rolled off the surface of the runway and hit a snow windrow 5 feet beyond the edge of the runway. The aircraft continued to veer to the left and came to rest in a compacted snowbank 40 feet from the runway. One of the passengers received minor injuries. The aircraft sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, landing gear, and propellers. The accident occurred during the hours of darkness, when visibility was reduced to approximately 2 statute miles in snow showers. Findings as to causes and contributing factors: 1. The pilot flying did not look far enough ahead for long enough to notice that the aircraft was deviating to the left before veering off the runway. 2. Given that the pilot monitoring was not looking out the window to monitor the aircraftÂs path, he did not notice the deviation and was therefore unable to help the pilot flying correct the deviation in the path during the take-off roll. 3. The strong authority gradient between the pilots reduced the effectiveness of monitoring, which resulted in a failure to detect and correct the deviation from the departure path. 4. During the takeoff-rejection procedure, the pilot flying accidentally caught the right engine power lever with his finger, pushing the lever completely forward, and placed only the left lever in the idle position, which produced a significant dissymmetry in the torque and accentuated the deviation from the path, resulting in the runway excursion. 5. Since the pilot flying was able to place only 1 power lever in the idle position, it is highly likely that he did not have his right hand on the levers, contrary to what is stated in the standard operating procedures. Consequently, he was not ready to quickly and safely reject the takeoff.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A19Q0010 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: TSB A19Q0010   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Â There were no injuries and the airplane received substantial damage.  According to flight crew statements, the crew advised the tug driver they were cleared to push back, either tail east or straight back. At the time of the accident, dark night conditions existed and the ramp was contaminated with snow.  During the pushback, the flight crew started No. 1 and 2 engines. The tug driver pushed the airplane back with its empennage towards the east and then notified the captain that he would pull forward to straighten them out. As the tug driver pulled the airplane forward and was coming to a stop the airplane's nose began to drift to the left.Â  The tug detached from the airplane and impacted the right forward fuselage and right engine air intake resulting in substantial damage. The captain noted that the nose swung to the left, and then said it felt as if the airplane was moving backwards.  According to the operator, on the morning of the accident, the ramp management company had instructed their ground personnel that all pushbacks should be straight back pushes due to the snowy conditions. It is likely that the angle of the towbar from pushing the airplane back to the east, combined with the snow contaminated ramp and the engine idle thrust, caused the tug driver to lose control of the tug during the pushback. Probable Cause: loss of control of the tug by the driver during pushback operations as a result of the contaminated ramp, angle of the towbar, and the airplane engines being at idle thrust.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA19CA079 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight departed Laredo International Airport, Texas, USA at 18:26 CST on an IFR flight plan. There were no irregularities or operational issues reported during the takeoff and enroute portion of the flight. According to the flight crew, the captain was the pilot flying when the accident occurred. At 19:58, the Birmingham Approach air traffic controller advised the crew that the wind at TCL was from 200 degrees at 4 knots. The crew acknowledged and advised that they would use runway 4. The controller instructed them to report the airport in sight. At 20:01, the crew reported the airport in sight, and the controller cleared them for the visual approach. There was no communication regarding any difficulty with the airplane. According to the flight crew, about 12 miles from the airport the captain called for flaps 15 and gear down. After the gear was selected down, the CVR recorded the first officer stating, ""yeah it's down, but [unintelligible] the lights [unintelligible]"" The crew reported that they noted a red warning light for the nose gear position, and heard the audible gear warning horn.

The aircraft sustained significant damage to the right side of the fuselage that affected the airframe, the hydraulic system and the landing gear. Causes/Contributing factors:  The investigation has determined that the accident was caused by the loss of control of the aircraft on the ground in conditions close to the maximum demonstrated cross wind limit due to the fact that this maneuver was not performed according to the procedure published by the manufacturer.  The following are considered to be contributing factors: - The absence of communication between crew members on cross wind landing technique during the approach briefing. - The surprise and shock effect on the crew produced by the behaviour of the aircraft in the first moments after the landing, which affected negatively their subsequent actions and caused them to react instinctively instead of applying the procedure published by the manufacturer.METAR: 16:00 UTC / 17:00 local time: LEPA 281600Z 32026G40KT 9999 FEW020 15/05 Q1006 NOSIG16:30 UTC / 17:30 local time: LEPA 281630Z 32024G34KT 290V350 9999 FEW020 14/06 Q1007 NOSIG 17:00 UTC / 18:00 local time: LEPA 281700Z 32024G34KT 9999 FEW020 14/06 Q1007 NOSIG Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIAIAC Report number: A-004/2019 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: CIAIAC History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  13 September 2011 OY-CIM Cimber Sterling 0 Copenhagen-Kastrup Airport (CPH/EKCH) min Engine failure 19 February 2021 EC-LYJ Swiftair 0 Palma de Mallorca Airport (PMI/LEPA) min Tire failure Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane was being operated by Guardian Flight as an IFR air ambulance flight. The pilot, flight paramedic, and flight nurse were fatally injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the destination airport.  The flight departed Anchorage-Ted Stevens International Airport (PANC), Alaska, about 16:04 destined for Kake. At 18:07 the Anchorage Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) cleared the flight for the area navigation (RNAV) runway 11 approach to Kake. The accident airplane crossed the CEMGA waypoint on the RNAV runway 11 approach at an altitude of about 7,000 ft, then turned northeast and crossed the ZOLKO initial approach fix about 5,000 ft msl. The airplane then initiated a gradual descent and continued northeast toward the JOJOE intermediate fix. About 18:10, while the flight was between ZOLKO and JOJOE, the airplane entered a right turn toward a southerly heading and began a rapid descent, losing about 2,575 ft of altitude in 14 seconds.

Both pilots were killed. The aircraft operated flight 503, an instrument flight rules flight itinerary from Yellowknife to WhatÃ¬ Airport, WekweÃ¨tÃ¬ Airport, and Ekati Aerodrome.  During the flight preparations at Yellowknife the first officer (FO) noted that the right-side vacuum-driven attitude indicator was not erect. The captain assured the FO that the instrument would start to operate. The flight took off from Yellowknife at 08:51. During the climb, while working the after-takeoff checklist, it appeared that the right-side ADI still wasn't working. The captain suggested to the FO that he should tap the attitude indicator to see if it was stuck or frozen. The FO replied that the attitude indicator was still not erect. While en route at FL120 the pilots attempted to troubleshoot the right-side attitude indicator, but to avail.  At 09:11, after having commenced the descent, the captainÂs attitude indicator on the left-side instrument panel displayed a red ""GYRO"" flag and the autopilot disconnected. At this time the captain began to manually fly the aircraft with partial flight instruments. The aircraft continued to descend, and the captain attempted to initiate a climb. The aircraft climbed briefly before beginning to descend again. The aircraft subsequently entered a gradual left turn that progressed into a steep descending left turn (spiral) from which the aircraft never recovered. The investigation established that both the captain and the FO had an iPad mini equipped with the ForeFlight Mobile application which had the capability to provide a backup attitude indication and synthetic vision view to both pilots. Since it was a backup feature, Air Tindi did not have a formal training program in place for using the attitude and heading reference system (AHRS) feature of ForeFlight. Findings as to causes and contributing factors: 1. For undetermined reasons, the left-side attitude indicator failed in flight. 2. Although just before take off the crew acknowledged that the right-side attitude indicator was not operative, they expected it to become operative at some point in the flight. As a result, they did not refer to the minimum equipment list, and departed into instrument meteorological conditions with an inoperative attitude indicator. 3. The crewÂs threat and error management was not effective in mitigating the risk associated with the unserviceable right-side attitude indicator. 4. The crewÂs crew resource management was not effective, resulting in a breakdown in verbal communication, a loss of situation awareness, and the aircraft entering an unsafe condition. 5. The captain did not have recent experience in flying partial panel. As a result, the remaining instruments were not used effectively and the aircraft departed controlled flight and entered a spiral dive. 6. The captain and first officer likely experienced spatial disorientation. 7. Once the aircraft emerged below the cloud layer at approximately 2000 feet above ground, the crew were unable to recover control of the aircraft in enough time and with enough altitude to avoid an impact with terrain.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A19W0015 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: CBC  Transport Canada History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  5 April 2014 C-GTUC Discovery Air International 0 Near Cambridge Bay Airport min Windscreen cracks or failure Location  Images: photo (c) TSB; WhatÃ¬/Lac La Martre Airport, NT (YLE); 30 January 2019 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

At the time of the turbulence, two flight attendants (FA) had just started to prepare for beverage service in the aft galley when they were thrown to the floor. Both FAs crawled to the last row of seats as the turbulence continued.  The two FAs were then assisted for the remainder of the flight by to passenger medical professionals.  After landing, the FAs were transported to the hospital where one was diagnosed with a broken foot and the other with minor bruises. Probable Cause: An inadvertent encounter with clear air turbulence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA19CA075 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years Download report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA19CA075 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  27 May 2022 N852NN American Airlines 0 SE of Providenciales unk Engine failure Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates04-May-2023 05:32 ASN Update Bot Added 04-May-2023 05:41 harro Updated Corrections or additions? ...

The captain was the pilot flying and the first officer was the pilot monitoring. The en route flight, the descent and the initial approach for runway 27 at Billund proceeded uneventfully, with the aircraft being radar vectored for an Instrument Landing System (ILS) approach. On final approach to runway 27, Billund Tower cleared the aircraft to land and reported the wind conditions to be 200Â° 12 knots (kts), maximum 29 kts, and minimum 5 kts. Throughout the approach, the flight crew experienced moderate turbulence. The flight crew modified final approach speed (VAPP) was 148 kts (the flight crew added 2 kts the calculated VAPP of 146 kts). At 1000 ft, and at 500 ft Radio Height (RH), the first officer made calls on stabilized approach. The aircraft was configured for landing, with flap position 3, stabilized, and the autopilot engaged and the autothrust engaged and activated in SPEED mode. At approximately 700 ft RH, the flight crew got visual contact with the runway. The Calibrated Air Speed (CAS) from 500 ft RH down to initial touchdown varied between approximately 160 kts CAS and 145 kts CAS. The aircraft remained stabilized on both localizer and glidepath down to 100 ft RH. On short final, the first officer informed the captain of a displayed crosswind of 36 kts. At approximately 190 ft RH, the captain disconnected the autopilot and flew the final approach manually with the autothrust engaged and activated in SPEED mode. At 100 ft RH, the first officer made a standard operating call on aircraft pitch attitude: Pitch 2.5. From approximately 100 ft RH until 35 ft RH, the vertical speed increased from approximately 700 ft/minute (min) to approximately 1100 ft/min. At approximately 25 ft RH, the captain used an abrupt and progressive aft sidestick input and pulled back on the sidestick to full aft  deflection to stop the rate of descent. The synthetic voice calls TWENTY, RETARD and the initial touchdown occurred almost simultaneously. Before recorded activation of both main landing gear squat switches (weight on wheels - WOW), the captain advanced the thrust levers forward of the climb detent position. The aircraft made an initial touchdown at approximately 148 kts CAS, with a recorded pitch angle of 5.63Â°, a rate of decent of approximately 750 ft/min, and a vertical acceleration of 2.59 g. Upon initial touch down, the ground spoilers did not extend, and the autothrust deactivated. The aircraft lifted off the ground and up to 12 ft RH. During the bounce, the captain repeatedly voiced his surprise on the lack of flare. In the air, the engines spooled up, and the CAS increased to approximately 156 kts. Two synthetic voice calls on excessive pitch (PITCH), and one thrust lever retarding synthetic voice call (RETARD) sounded. The captain retarded the thrust levers to flight idle resulting in ground spoiler extension. The aircraft made a second touchdown at approximately 154 kts CAS, with a recorded pitch angle of 9.49Â° and a vertical acceleration of 2.56 g. The aircraft tail section struck the runway. Upon landing, neither of the pilots perceived that a tailstrike might have occurred, and the flight crew continued taxiing to the apron. During taxi to the apron, the captain briefed the passengers on the hard landing. The AIB considers the contributing factors to this specific tailstrike to be: - Gusting and strong crosswinds in dark night. - Moderate turbulence and downdrafts on short final to runway 27 at EKBI. - Too high sink rate, just prior reaching the flare height (destabilization). - No flight crew calls and/or decision on going around on short final or during the bounce. - Two hard landings. - Inappropriate thrust lever management. - Inappropriate pitch control during the bounce resulting in a pitch angle increasing beyond the critical angle.METAR: 17:20 UTC / 18:20 local time: EKBI 021720Z 35006KT 5000 BKN007 00/M00 Q100318:20 UTC / 19:20 local time: EKBI 021820Z 33007KT 7000 SCT007 BKN025 00/M01 Q1004Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: HCLJ Report number: 2019-57 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SHK   Location  Images: photo (c) AIB Denmark; Billund Airport (BLL); February 2019 photo (c) AIB Denmark; Billund Airport (BLL); 08 February 2019 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The captain was fatally injured, and the co-pilot was seriously injured. The airplane was operated by Conquest Air Cargo on a cargo flight from Opa Locka to Nassau, Bahamas and back. The flight to Nassau was normal until the co-pilot had to adjust the left engine propeller control to adjust speed for cruise flight. When he manipulated the control, there was no movement on the gauge and the power was stuck at 2,400 RPM. He tried to re-set the propeller control circuit breaker, but to no avail. The captain equalized power on both engines and the flight was uneventful to Nassau. Once on the ground, the captain asked the co-pilot to send a text message to maintenance control, but the message never transmitted. The captain told the co-pilot not worry about it and if they were unable to re-set the propeller control on the ground during the engine run-up then they would shut down and call maintenance. The co-pilot stated to the NTSB that before they began the accident flight, the engines started normally and both propellers were cycled. The left propeller control had re-set itself and they departed for Opa Locka. The co-pilot was Pilot Flying on the return leg and everything was normal until climbing through 4,000 ft when the left engine propeller control stopped working and the power was stuck at 2,400 RPM. The captain tried to adjust the control and bumped the power up to 2,700 RPM. The captain took control of the airplane and tried to stabilize the power on both engines. He leveled off at 4,500 ft, cancelled their instrument flight rules flight plan, and flew via visual flight rules direct to Opa Locka. The flight was normal until they began their descent down to 1,500 ft. The right engine suddenly backfired and began to surge. The flight crew used the checklist to feather the propeller and shut down the engine. Shortly after the left engine backfired and began to surge. As the captain flew the airplane, the co-pilot attempted to handle the emergency. Once he realized they were too low and were going to ditch, he asked the captain what he wanted to do. The captain told him to declare a May Day and brace for impact. The co-pilot said the impact with the water was violent and the tail had separated from the empennage. The fuselage was filling up rapidly with water. He unbuckled his seat belt/shoulder harness, grabbed the life raft and exited the airplane. Probable Cause: ""The captain's decision to continue with the flight with a malfunctioning left engine propeller control and the subsequent loss of engine power on both engines for undetermined reasons, which resulted in ditching into the ocean. Contributing to the accident was the first officer's failure to challenge the captain's decision to continue with the flight.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA19LA096 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Miami Herald  Flightradar24  Flightaware  Coast Guard  NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) Flightaware / Google Earth; off Bay Harbor Islands, FL; 08 February 2019 photo (c) Reiner Geerdts, via Werner Fischdick; Opa-Locka Airport, FL (OPF/KOPF); 24 January 2019 photo (c) Jaime Escobar; Opa-Locka Airport, FL (OPF/KOPF); April 2012 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The three occupants were uninjured. The airplane sustained substantial wing and fuselage damage. After reviewing the weather at the destination airport the pilots decided they would be landing on runway 24 using the GPS approach. They reviewed weather at least ""4 or 5 times"" on the installed avionics display and the pilot stated that the displayed information indicated conditions of 1.5 miles visibility, ceiling of 1,500 ft, wind 090 at 4 knots, with fog and mist. The crew discussed the approach and talked about having a 4 knot quartering tailwind. When the airplane was near Richmond, the first officer listened to the automated weather observing system recording and it was reporting 3/4 mile visibility and 1,500 ft ceiling, scattered 300, wind 090 at 4 knots, temp 0C, dew point 0 C, altimeter 30.13 inches of mercury.

The airplane was about ""300 ft"" and the first officer called the runway to the left. The pilot looked up and saw the precision approach path indicator lights to the left and the runway straight ahead. However, the runway appeared to have a ""very light coating of snow on it."" The pilot elected to land and apply full thrust reverse and braking. The pilot also queried the first officer about the spoilers and the first officer confirmed the spoilers were out. A few seconds later the pilot felt the airplane was not slowing much and advised the first officer that the airplane was going to go off the end. At that point, the first officer said that he saw the 2,000 ft marker ahead of the airplane. Both pilots were pushing the brakes as hard as they could and full reverse was applied. The airplane went off the end of the runway and ended up across a road near the runway.

Of the 75 passengers and crew onboard, one flight attendant sustained serious injuries while two flight attendants and two passengers received minor injuries. The airplane sustained minor damage. The flight  was operating under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 as a regularly scheduled passenger flight from the John Wayne-Orange County Airport (KSNA), Santa Ana, California to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (KSEA), Seattle, Washington.  According to the flight crew, about 40 minutes into the flight when the airplane was in smooth air and 'between cloud layers', the captain informed the flight attendants that they could begin cabin service but left the seatbelt sign illuminated for passengers because there was a report of 'occasional light chop'. About 20 minutes later, the flight encountered an area of severe turbulence that lasted about 8 seconds and caused the airplane to rapidly gain altitude and the traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS) to issue a resolution advisory (RA) for opposite-direction traffic 1,000 ft above them. The first officer (FO) , who was the flying pilot, disengaged the autopilot and applied forward control pressure to comply with the RA.  The FO could not obtain the target flight path vector directed by the TCAS, so the captain assisted on the controls to obtain the desired pitch attitude. After the airplane descended back to its assigned altitude, the TCAS RA cleared, and the captain informed air traffic control of the turbulence and TCAS RA. According to the flight attendants (FA), the turbulence was encountered as they were beginning the beverage service. Two of the FAs impacted the ceiling before falling to the floor and one passenger, who had been in the lavatory at the time of the encounter had a small head laceration. As a result of the injuries, the captain declared an emergency and the flight diverted to KRNO. The FA in the aft galley was assisted by a medically qualified passenger and remained on the floor until landing due to her injuries. She was transported to the hospital and diagnosed with a broken arm.  Post accident examination of the weather satellite data depicted cloud patterns aloft consistent with the presence of a convective updraft coincident with the flight's location at the time of the turbulence encounter. The convection appeared to be Ã¢â¬ÅembeddedÃ¢â¬Â with stratiform clouds and may not have been visually identifiable by the flight crew. Probable Cause: an inadvertent encounter with convective turbulence that resulted in a TCAS RA, which required an abrupt control input by the flight crew to resolve the conflict.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA19CA081 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA19CA081  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates14-Feb-2019 08:20 Goklerdeyiz.net Added 15-Feb-2019 18:30 Captain Adam Updated [Time, Other fatalities, Location, Narrative, ]08-Mar-2019 08:56 harro Updated [Time, Total occupants, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, ]31-Mar-2021 08:22 ASN Update Bot Updated [Time, Other fatalities, Nature, Destination airport, Source, Damage, Narrative, Category, Accident report, ]31-Mar-2021 10:47 harro Updated [Nature, Source, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

Of the 145 passengers and crew onboard, one flight attendant sustained serious injuries and one received minor injuries. The airplane was not damaged. The flight was operating under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 as a regularly scheduled passenger flight from Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport (KBZN), Bozeman, Montana, to KATL. According to the flight crew, air traffic control informed them to expect light and occasional moderate turbulence during the descent. About 10 minutes before beginning their descent, the flight crew illuminated the seat belt sign and instructed the flight attendants (FA) to stow the carts and take their seats. Shortly after departing FL350 for FL250, and the airplane encountered two 'rapid-bumps of light-moderate turbulenceÃ¢â¬Â at approximately FL345. The flight crew slowed the airplane and contacted the FAs and was informed that the aft FA was injured. According to the flight attendants, the flight had been routine, having experienced only occasional light turbulence. The two aft FAs had finished their meal service and secured the galley. The two FAs were making their final walkthrough of the cabin when the captain made the public address announcement to discontinue cabin service, when the turbulence was encountered. The two aft FAs reported they were thrown up to the ceiling and then came 'crashing back downÃ¢â¬Â onto the galley floor. One of the FAs was in intense pain after striking the floor hard and was attended to by two medically qualified passengers. The FA was moved to an empty passenger row for landing and was provided oxygen and pain medication. The flight crew declared an emergency and requested paramedics meet the flight at the gate. The FA was transported to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a fractured vertebra. Post accident examination of the weather data determined that the accident flight was in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) in an area of convectively induced turbulence due to embedded rain shower activity when the turbulence was encountered. While there was no lightning activity around the accident site at the accident time, there were pockets of strong rain shower cells within the complex of precipitation as a whole. The area where the accident occurred was covered by AIRMET Tango that warned of moderate turbulence conditions. Probable Cause: an encounter with convective turbulence during descent.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA19CA091 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA19CA091 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  19 June 2010 N3730B Delta Air Lines 0 New York-John F.

All three on board were killed. The aircraft departed Miami International Airport, Florida at 11:33 hours local time (16:33 UTC) on a cargo flight to Houston-George Bush Intercontinental Airport, Texas, USA. The cruising altitude of FL400 was reached after 20 minutes. Descent towards Houston was commenced at 12:07 hours local time (18:07 UTC).  About 12:30 the pilots contacted the Houston terminal radar approach control (TRACON) arrival controller and reported descending for runway 26L; the airplane was at 17,800 ft with a ground speed 320 knots. As the flight descended toward the airport, the flight crew extended the speedbrakes, lowered the slats, and began setting up the flight management computer for the approach. The FO was the pilot flying, the captain was the pilot monitoring, and the autopilot and autothrottle were engaged and remained engaged for the remainder of the flight.  At 12:34, the airplane was descending through 13,800 ft, and the controller advised of an area of light to heavy precipitation along the flight route and that they could expect vectors around the weather. About 12:35, the flight was transferred to the Houston TRACON final controller, and the pilot reported they had received the Houston Automatic Terminal Information System weather broadcast. The controller told the pilots to expect vectors to runway 26L and asked if they wanted to go to the west or north of the weather. Radar data indicated the airplane continued the descent through 12,000 ft with a ground speed of 290 knots, consistent with the arrival procedure. The pilots responded that they wanted to go to the west of the area of precipitation. The controller advised that to do so, they would need to descend to 3,000 ft expeditiously. About 12:37, the controller instructed the pilots to turn to a heading of 270Â°. Radar data indicated the airplane turned, and the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) data indicated a selected heading of 270Â°. The airplane was descending through 8,500 ft at this time. About 12:38, the controller informed the pilots that they would be past the area of weather in about 18 miles, that they could expect a turn to the north for a base leg to the approach to runway 26L, and that weather was clear west of the precipitation area. The pilots responded, ""sounds good"" and ""ok.""  At this time, radar and ADS-B returns indicated the airplane levelled briefly at 6,200 ft and then began a slight climb to 6,300 ft. Also, about this time, the FDR data indicated that some small vertical accelerations consistent with the airplane entering turbulence.  At 12:38:31, the airplaneÂs go-around mode was activated. Shortly after, when the airplaneÂs indicated airspeed was steady about 230 knots, the engines increased to maximum thrust, and the airplane pitch increased to about 4Â° nose up. The airplane then pitched nose down over the next 18 seconds to about 49Â° in response to nose-down elevator deflection. The stall warning (stick shaker) did not activate. FDR, radar, and ADS-B data indicated that the airplane entered a rapid descent on a heading of 270Â°, reaching an airspeed of about 430 knots. A security camera video captured the airplane in a steep, generally wings-level attitude until impact with the swamp. FDR data indicated that the airplane gradually pitched up to about 20 degrees nose down during the descent. The NTSB found that the first officerÂs repeated uses of incomplete and inaccurate information about his employment history on resumes and applications were deliberate attempts to conceal his history of performance deficiencies and deprived Atlas Air and at least one other former employer of the opportunity to fully evaluate his aptitude and competency as a pilot. He had a long history of training performance difficulties and his tendency to respond impulsively and inappropriately when faced with an unexpected event during training scenarios at multiple employers suggest an inability to remain calm during stressful situations; a tendency that may have exacerbated his aptitude-related performance difficulties. Probable Cause: The NTSB determines that the probable cause of this accident was the inappropriate response by the first officer as the pilot flying to an inadvertent activation of the go-around mode, which led to his spatial disorientation and nose-down control inputs that placed the airplane in a steep descent from which the crew did not recover. Contributing to the accident was the captainÂs failure to adequately monitor the airplaneÂs flightpath and assume positive control of the airplane to effectively intervene. Also contributing were systemic deficiencies in the aviation industryÂs selection and performance measurement practices, which failed to address the first officerÂs aptitude-related deficiencies and maladaptive stress response. Also contributing to the accident was the Federal Aviation AdministrationÂs failure to implement the Pilot Records Database in a sufficiently robust and timely manner.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NTSB/AAR-20/02 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Flightradar24  Atlas Air statement  FAA statement  NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Trinity Bay, near Anahuac, TX; February 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Trinity Bay, near Anahuac, TX; February 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Trinity Bay, near Anahuac, TX; February 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Trinity Bay, near Anahuac, TX; 23 February 2019 photo (c) Flightaware; Trinity Bay, near Anahuac, TX; 23 February 2019 photo (c) NTSB; Trinity Bay, near Anahuac, TX; 23 February 2019 photo (c) NTSB; Trinity Bay, near Anahuac, TX; 23 February 2019 photo (c) NTSB; Trinity Bay, near Anahuac, TX; 23 February 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Trinity Bay, near Anahuac, TX; 23 February 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; 02 March 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; March 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) Jaime Escobar; Miami International Airport, FL (MIA/KMIA); 26 October 2017 photo (c) Reiner Geerdts; Miami International Airport, FL (MIA/KMIA); 19 January 2019 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft slid sideways off the left side of the runway and became stuck in snow.  The six occupants were not injured. The aircraft operated on a flight from Baku, Azerbaijan. The en route and descent part of the flight were uneventful. The flight crew performed an ILS approach to runway 24C at Sheremetyevo Airport. The aircraft was cleared to land on runway 24C and wind was reported from 300Â° at 5 m/s (10 kts) with gusts to 10 m/s (20 kts). At a height of 80 meters, the captain switched off the autopilot and continued manually. The aircraft touched down at an airspeed of 150 knots, 250 m pas the runway threshold. Brakes were applied and the thrust reversers were deployed. During rollout the no.2 engine was brought back to idle and the thrust reverser stowed. The no.1 (left) engine remained at maximum reverse, causing the aircraft to swing to the left, off the side of the runway. Conclusion: The reason for the accident with the Gulfstream G200 4K-AZ88 was the stowing of the right-engine reverser by the captain from maximum thrust reversal while maintaining maximum thrust reversal on the left engine, which led to the appearance of a significant turning moment to the left. The aircraft turning to the left in the presence of a cross wind to the right, as well as turbulence of the airflow near the rudder due to the open thrust reversal mechanism of the left engine and possible ice deposition on the outer surfaces of the aircraft, which led to the development of a significant swing moment on the rudder. The development of a significant articulated moment on the rudder, in the absence of power steering in the rudder control system, led to its deviation to the leftmost position despite significant (up to 82 kg or 180 pounds) forces exerted by the crew on the pedals. The deviation of the rudder (pedals) to the left also led to the deviation of the nose wheel to the left. The total moment from the running reverse of the left engine, from the right engine in direct draft mode, and from the rudder and nose wheel deflection to the left, led to the aircraft rolling out of the runway and its damage. Separate braking applied by the crew could not prevent the aircraft from rolling out. The contributing factors could have been: - the crew did not take into account the provisions of the AOM about the possible ""destabilizing"" effect of the thrust reverse when landing with a cross wind on the runway with a reduced braking coefficient; - increased psycho-emotional tension of the crew members due to long dissatisfaction and emotional discussion of instructions and actions of ATC controllers. At the same time, the instructions and actions of the ATC service controllers were in line with established procedures.METAR: 06:00 UTC / 09:00 local time: UUEE 260600Z 31006MPS 9000 -SHSN SCT009 BKN020CB 01/00 Q1000 R24C/550336 R24L/550345 TEMPO 1000 SHSN07:00 UTC / 10:00 local time: UUEE 260700Z 32006MPS 9000 -SN OVC008 01/00 Q1000 R24C/550336 R24L/550345 NOSIG08:00 UTC / 11:00 local time: UUEE 260800Z 33006MPS 9999 OVC011 01/M00 Q1001 R24C/550336 R24L/550345 NOSIG09:00 UTC / 12:00 local time: UUEE 260900Z 33006MPS 5000 -SN SCT008 OVC023 01/M00 Q1001 R24L/550345 R24C/550336 NOSIG10:00 UTC / 13:00 local time: UUEE 261000Z 33005MPS 9999 OVC009 01/00 Q1002 R24L/550345 R24C/510345 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: MAK   Location  Images: photo (c) MAK; Moskva-Sheremetyevo Airport (SVO); 26 February 2019 photo (c) MAK; Moskva-Sheremetyevo Airport (SVO); 26 February 2019 photo (c) MAK; Moskva-Sheremetyevo Airport (SVO); 26 February 2019 photo (c) MAK; Moskva-Sheremetyevo Airport (SVO); February 2019 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

While the aircraft was being prepared for flight, both pilots reported being aware of a sweet-smelling odour after the APU and APU bleed had been turned on to heat the cabin. They described the smell as being like caramel but considered that such odours were not unusual after the APU is started and the air conditioning is switched on at the beginning of the day. Following completion of passenger boarding, the aircraft pushed back and taxied before being cleared to enter Runway 26, back-track and line up for take-off. It was daylight, the visibility was in excess of 10 km and the wind was from 210Â° at 5 knots. The APU was shut down as the aircraft entered the runway and the air conditioning packs remained on with air supplied from the engines. A few seconds later, while back-tracking, both pilots became aware of fumes in the flight deck with a different odour, which the co‑pilot described as being like paint or white spirit. The wind was behind the aircraft at this point, so they initially thought the fumes were due to exhaust gas ingestion. Upon lining up at the runway threshold the flight crew had a brief discussion about whether the fumes were decreasing and decided that they were. Upon receiving take-off clearance, the co-pilot advanced the thrust levers to 40% while holding the aircraft on the brakes and checked the engine indications, which were all normal. He then slowly advanced the thrust levers towards the take-off setting, while still holding the aircraft on the brakes. As the engines reached approximately 55% power, he saw something out of the corner of his eye which he believed to have been a puff of smoke coming from an air conditioning vent. He immediately stated that he was not happy with the situation and retarded the thrust levers to idle. By then the smell of fumes had grown worse and smoke was visibly entering the flight deck. The commander set the park brake and asked the co-pilot to turn the engine bleeds and air conditioning packs to off and the flight deck windows were opened to ventilate the flight deck. There were no EICAS messages or warnings. The commander established contact with the senior cabin crew member (SCCM), who had simultaneously been trying to contact the flight deck. The SCCM reported that there was smoke and fumes in the cabin, but that the cabin crew could not identify the source. The commander decided to evacuate the aircraft. The co-pilot immediately selected flap 5, notified ATC of the intention to evacuate and requested assistance. Both pilots then carried out the Emergency Evacuation âvital actionsâ.  During the evacuation, passengers who evacuated via the over-wing exits reported being unsure of how to get down from the wing to the ground and several re-entered the cabin and exited via one of the escape slides. The smoke and fumes were subsequently attributed to an incorrectly performed engine compressor wash procedure, which was carried out by maintenance personnel the night before the occurrence flight. As a result of the findings of this investigation, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has undertaken two safety actions relating to the certification requirements for over-wing emergency exits. The operator has also undertaken several safety actions relating to passenger safety briefings, processes for maintenance planning, engineer training, competency and welfare and monitoring of ground equipment. Four Safety Recommendations are made relating to the certification requirements for over-wing exit markings and the height requirement for over-wing exits to be equipped with an assisted means of escape.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: AAIB-25591 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: 1.

The No 1 engine had been shut down in accordance with the operatorâs SOPs. As it approached the stand, at walking pace, the commander applied the brakes, which had no effect and the aircraft hit signage and the rotating No 2 (right) propeller struck a nearby ground power unit (GPU).  During the collision the aircraft sustained damage to the nose fuselage behind the radome, a nose landing gear door and right propeller tips. There were no injuries to the passengers or crew. There were a series of minor factors which coincided to cause this accident. The landing was the last of a day which had consisted of repeated and routine sectors. The absence of the approach checks meant that the aircraft was not configured correctly in preparation for the operatorâs SOP in which, after landing, the No 1 engine is shut down and the aircraft taxied to the stand on the No 2 engine. That did not predestine the aircraft to remain in this incorrect configuration. There was a further intervention during the after landing checks with the check of the stby hyd press and ptu cntrl advisory light. However, this check was also overlooked when the crew were distracted by remembering that the aircraft required an OSG check after the last flight of the week which then interrupted the after landing checks. After this, there were no other prompts during the remainder of the taxi by which to indentify the situation. When the accident sequence was underway, and the crew realised what was happening, the co-pilot remembered the stby hyd press and ptu cntrl were off and tried to switch them on, by which time it was too late.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: EW/G2019/03/01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: AAIB Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates11-Jun-2023 14:26 harro Added Corrections or additions? ...

The landing of the aircraft occurred under unfavorable weather conditions caused by heavy rain over the airfield and sudden variation in the direction and intensity of the surface wind. At the exact moment of the touch down, the wind was from a direction of 057Â° at 19kts. The contact of the aircraft with the ground occurred about 916m beyond the threshold of runway 15 with the right main landing gear completely outside the lateral limits of the runway, at a speed of 121kts. After landing, the aircraft traveled 668m outside the runway. The pilot regained control of the aircraft and returned it to runway 15. Contributing factors. - Control skills Â a contributor. The corrections applied to the flight commands, in order to control the tendency of the aircraft to laterally deviate to the right in relation to the center of SBGL runway 15, were not sufficient to stop this movement, nor to redirect the aircraft to the central axis of flight. Consequently, the aircraft touched the ground with the right main landing gear outside the runway's lateral limits. - Organizational climate Â undetermined. When considering the organizational climate present in the company at the time of the occurrence, it is possible that this scenario has influenced the assessments and, consequently, the crew's decision to proceed with the landing, despite the adverse conditions encountered. - Adverse meteorological conditions Â a contributor. The significant change in the direction and intensity of the wind in the final approach, which started to blow from the left abeam, and the increase in the intensity of the rain on the Aerodrome, which impaired the pilots' peripheral vision and compromised the exact notion of depth of the aircraft in relation to the runway, contributed to the drifting movement of the aircraft to the right side of the SBGL runway 15. - Crew Resource Management Â a contributor. When the aircraft was flying below 100ft height, the copilot conducted several callouts stating that the aircraft was off the runway axis. The commander collated the first ones, however, after a certain moment; he no longer properly responded to the copilot's callouts and proceeded to land, despite the repeated alerts received. The copilot, even realizing that the commander's corrections were not enough to control the aircraft and return it to the central axis of the runway, did not ask the commander, more assertively, to execute a go-around procedure in flight. This showed that the crewmembers had enough information to discontinue the landing, but they chose not to use this feature, which contributed to the occurrence. - Piloting judgment Â a contributor. There was an incomplete assessment of the aircraft's flight conditions. Once the tendency of lateral deviation to the right of the central axis of the runway was detected, the pilots thought it possible to correct this tendency in time to make the landing safely, which contributed to the outcome of the occurrence. - Perception Â a contributor. The maintenance of the focus on the lateral deviation of the aircraft interfered in the identification of other variables present, such as the condition of destabilization and low visibility, which could affect the landing in a safe way. Thus, this selective perception, reinforced by the expectation of completing the landing at the destination, contributed to the outcome of this occurrence. - Management planning Â undetermined. All crewmembers on flight O66227 were called for the mission in accordance with the on notice roster. The calling of the copilot and the flight chief did not adhere to the established in the company's MGO; consequently, both were late to present themselves for the aircraft commander. Flight O66227 took off 30 minutes after the scheduled time. It is possible to consider that the delayed takeoff from Salvador to Rio de Janeiro had a negative influence on the assessments and the decision of the crewmembers to proceed with the execution of the landing. - Decision-making process Â a contributor. There was a compromised analysis of the information available to the crew, so that the aircraft's destabilization condition was not considered, as well as the meteorological degradation in the final approach, culminating in the decision to try to correct the aircraft until the last moment, even if unanswered, and proceed with the landing on SBGL.METAR: 20:00 UTC /  local time: SBGL 032000Z 15006KT 9999 4000NE -TSRA FEW012 BKN025 FEW027TCU FEW030CB OVC080 27/24 Q101320:18 UTC /  local time: SBGL 032018Z 08004KT 3000 +TSRA FEW012 BKN025 FEW030CB OVC090 27/25 Q101420:43 UTC /  local time: SBGL 032043Z 02008G22KT 0500 R15///// R33///// R10/1000 R28/170 0 +TSRA FEW004 BKN009 BKN020 FEW030CB 23/22 Q1016Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CENIPA Report number: A-036/CENIPA/2019 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: CENIPA  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates15-Mar-2024 19:45 ASN Updated [Source, Accident report, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The first officer and two of the passengers were injured. The airplane was substantially damaged. The accident flight departed from Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), New Jersey, about 10:04. The captain was the pilot monitoring, and the first officer was the pilot flying. The en route portion of the flight was uneventful.  Once the airplane was in range of PQI, the flight crew received an updated airport weather report at the time, a special weather observation at 10:31. The observation indicated that the wind was from 090Â° at 5 knots, visibility was 1/2 mile in moderate snow and freezing fog, and the cloud ceiling was broken at 1,100 ft and overcast at 1,800 ft. At 11:01 a controller from the Boston Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) cleared the flight for an ILS approach to runway 1, and the crew was subsequently instructed to change to the PQI common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF); PQI did not have an air traffic control tower.  The captain made position reports during the approach and at 11:08:38 she stated that the approach was stable and that she had ""ground contact.""  At 11:09:54, the captain stated, ""runway in sight. See it?"" to which the first officer responded, ""yeah"" and ""well I got somethinÂ [that] looks like a runway up there.""  After losing sight of the runway, at 11:10:09, the captain stated, ""go missed"" twice. The first officer stated that, when he transitioned from looking at the instruments to looking outside, he expected to see the runway but saw what he described as ""white on white.""  The airplane had descended to a minimum pressure altitude of 703 ft (169 ft agl) before beginning to ascend.  The flight then positioned for a second approach to runway 1. The captain made the 1,000-ft callout at 11:27:21 and stated that the approach was stable. At 11:28:37, the enhanced ground proximity warning system announced ""minimums,"" shortly after the captain had made the 100-ft callout. About 2 seconds after the ""minimums"" annunciation, the captain called, ""runway in sight twelve oÂclock."" The first officer stated that, when he transitioned from the instruments to the outside during the second approach, he saw ""white on white"" again and blowing snow. The first officer also stated that it was difficult to comprehend what he was seeing outside the airplane because everything was covered in snow and that, before he could determine what he was seeing, the airplane touched down.  The airplane came to rest in the snow-covered grassy area between runway 1 and a parallel taxiway located about 630 ft to the right of the runway. The airplaneÂs resting location was about 3,600 ft beyond the runway threshold, about 305 ft to the right of the runway centerline, and about 230 ft from the right edge of runway. Probable Cause: The flight crewÂs decision, due to confirmation bias, to continue the descent below the decision altitude when the runway had not been positively identified.  Contributing to the accident were (1) the first officerÂs fatigue, which exacerbated his confirmation bias, and (2) the failure of CommutAir pilots who had observed the localizer misalignment to report it to the company and air traffic before the accident.METAR: 15:31 UTC / 10:31 local time: KPQI 041531Z AUTO 09005KT 1/2SM -SN FZFG BKN011 OVC018 M02/M04 A2971 RMK AO2 P0000 FZRANO RVRNO15:56 UTC / 10:56 local time: KPQI 041556Z AUTO 08006KT 1/2SM SN FZFG OVC013 M02/M04 A2970 RMK AO2 SLP103 P0001 T10221044 FZRANO RVRNO16:18 UTC / 11:18 local time: KPQI 041618Z AUTO 06004KT 1/2SM SN FZFG M03/M04 A2968 RMK AO2 P0000 FZRANO RVRNO16:43 UTC / 11:43 local time: KPQI 041643Z AUTO 07005KT 3/4SM -SN SCT008 OVC013 M01/M04 A2967 RMK AO2 P0001 FZRANO RVRNOAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA19FA089 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Flightaware   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Presque Isle International Airport, ME (PQI); 04 March 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Presque Isle International Airport, ME (PQI); 04 March 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Presque Isle International Airport, ME (PQI); 04 March 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) Charles Walters; Los Angeles International Airport, CA (LAX/KLAX); 24 January 2008 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft took off at 06:13 hours local time with a crew of three, eight passengers and 500 kgs of cargo. Adverse weather conditions were encountered en route and the crew decided divert to Miraflores (SKMF) where it landed at 07:39. There two more passengers boarded the flight for Villavicencio.  At 08:34 the aircraft took off from Miraflores and flew to San Jose del Guaviare (SKSJ) to refuel, where it landed at 09:14. The aircraft was fueled and the crew submitted a flight plan to Villavicencio with a total flight time of 45 minutes an altitude of 8,500 feet. Prior to departure one more passenger boarded the flight.  The aircraft took off at 09:55. At 10:15, when the aircraft was climbing through 8,100 feet and approximately 59NM (109 km) from Villavicencio, the flight reported engine problems and their failure to feather the propeller.  At the crew's request, ATC provided information on the location of several aerodromes in the area and the crew chose to proceed to La Rinconada aerodrome. The aircraft lost altitude and last radio contact was at 10:32 when the crew radioed that they had a runway in sight, with no further information. At 10:34 the aircraft hit the ground of a palm plantation with a high angle of descent and low speed. Flaps and undercarriage were retracted at the time of the accident. The aircraft slid across a gravel road and burst into flames. Probable Cause(s). The investigation determined that the accident was caused by the following probable causes: - Loss of control in-flight as a consequence of the decrease in minimum in-flight control speed and drag generated by the impossibility of performing the No. 1 engine propeller feathering in the face of engine failure. - Malfunction of the lubrication system of engine No. 1, evident in the abundant oil leakage from the engine, in flight, and in the governor of the left propeller; although discrepancies were found in the maintenance of the propeller feathering pressure line, it was not possible to determine the origin of the oil leakage. - Weaknesses in the aircraft Operator's operational procedures, lacking a standard that would facilitate a crew's decision making to act in the event of critical failures, in matters such as making an emergency landing on unprepared field or the selection of an alternate airfield. Contributing Factors: - Deficiencies in standard maintenance practices during repairs performed on the No. 1 engine's propeller propeller feathering oil pressure line. - Non-compliance with an effective and reliable maintenance program, which did not verify the operating conditions of the aircraft components; it was not possible to determine compliance with the last 50-hour service, Phase A, to engine No. 1 according to the company's maintenance program, since there are no records of that service in the Flight Log. - Inefficient safety management system of the Operator for not detecting errors in the maintenance processes and in the conduct and control of operations.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Aerocivil Report number: COL-19-10-GIA Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: elespectador.com  Aerocivil   Location  Images: photo (c) William Wilson; Villavicencio Airport (VVC/SKVV); 10 March 2011 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were no survivors among the 157 occupants. Takeoff roll began from runway 07R at 08:38 hours local time, with a flap setting of 5 degrees and a stabilizer setting of 5.6 units.  At 08:38:44, ten seconds after rotation, the left and right recorded Angle of Attack (AOA) values deviated. The left AOA decreased to 11.1Â° then increased to 35.7Â° while value of right AOA indicated 14.94Â°.  This resulted in the onset of the stick shaker followed by a master caution light. At the same time the captainÂs primary flight display (PFD) showed a drop in indicated airspeed (IAS) from 170Kt to 156Kt. The captain initially responded by reducing the pitch as a reaction to the stick shaker. This did not stop the stick shaker and the captain to stopped applying further nose down column input at a pitch angle of 7-8Â° above horizon Approaching 400 ft, the captain attempted to engage the autopilot (AP) but it was not successful. A second attempt failed as well. Passing 1000 ft radio altitude, at the third attempt, the autopilot was successfully engaged.  The captain asked the first officer to advise ATC of the inability to follow the planned departure due to a flight control problem and to request runway heading and climb 14,000ft. The left stall management yaw damper computer which was affected by inputs from a failed left AOA sensor calculated the left hand minimum operational airspeed erroneously above 340kt (VMO). This resulted in an overspeed warning. At the same time, the auto throttle operation was affected by the erroneous left AOA sensor value and remained in the Arm mode and failed to transition to N1 mode, which would have reduced the take-off thrust to climb thrust automatically.  The auto throttle did not give a warning or a failure flag for the flight crew when its operation was affected by the failed AOA sensor value. The first activation of the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) system occurred within a second where the auto throttle was supposed to reduce from take-off thrust to climb trust. And in less than another second the GPWS aural alert ""DONÂT SINK"" sounded twice. The activation of MCAS followed by GPWS aural alert with already ongoing stick shaker coupled with no failure flag or warning from the auto throttle in an extremely high workload environment must have caused the auto throttle remaining in the ARM mode with take-off thrust set to remain unnoticed by the crew.  At 08:39:45, captain requested flaps up and the first officer moved the flap handle to position 0. The autopilot then disengaged and the flaps reached the up position. At 08:40:00, because of the erroneous left AOA value, the MCAS activated the first automatic nose down trim for 9 seconds. At the end of the first MCAS activation the stabilizer position was 2.1 units with the captain pulling to pitch up the airplane, with a force of around 90 lbs (41 kg). At different times when the pilot applied electrical trim for short duration or longer duration the trim stopped at about 2.3 for unknown reasons. At 08:40:20 the second MCAS activation, lasting 7 seconds, was interrupted by the captainÂs electric trim up inputs. The captain applied a nine second electric trim-up input which fully counteracted the second MCAS input and stopped the GPWS warning but it did not bring the aircraft to a neutral trim condition. When MCAS activated for the third time an automatic nose-down trim was commanded there was no corresponding motion of the stabilizer, which is consistent with the stabilizer trim cutout switches being in the ÂcutoutÂ position. The captain repeatedly requested the first officer to pull up with him on the control column with pitch values oscillating between 7Â° nose up and -2Â° nose down. Pitch increased when both pilots applied forces, pitch decreased when a single pilot applied force (force oscillated between 80 lbs and 110 lbs (36-50 kg)). The vertical speed variations followed the variations of the pitch angle, with vertical speed was oscillating between -2,500 ft/min and 4,400 ft/min. The captain requested the first officer to try the manual trim wheel, and after seconds of intense efforts, the first officer told the captain that it was not working. This was due to the amount of force required to turn the trim wheel. At this moment the stabilizer trim was at 2.3 units with the IAS at 340 Kts. At 08:42:10 the captain asked and the first-officer to request radar control a vector to return. ATC instructed ET302 to turn right heading 260 degrees. During the radio communications with the ATC, the first officerÂs action on the control column was released which increased forces on the captainÂs control column. The captain then requested the first officer to check the Master Caution. Then, they both announced ""left alpha vane"". At this time the airplane was almost reaching the minimum safe altitude. After about 10 seconds the captain then told the first officer that they should pitch up together. The captain then told the first officer ""pitch is not enough"" and ""put them up"". A sound similar to stab trim cut-out switches being returned to normal was recorded on the CVR, thus the stab trim cut out switches were most likely turned back on at that moment. After a failed attempt to trim using the manual trim wheel as per the runaway stabilizer non-normal checklist and significant and unbearable amount of force on the control column, the flight crew were trying to find other means to relieve the force. The airplane was at 13800 ft; IAS was 367kt, pitch just below 1Â°, stabilizer at 2.3 units of trim, bank angle 21Â° right. The crew was busy pulling on the controls with high muscular force trying to maintain airplane flight path control and reach 14000 ft, a target on which they remained focused. Trying to maintain flight path control was a very demanding task and represented here a high workload, physically and mentally, to the detriment of every other task.  An overspeed warning added another disruption and disturbance on board. The cockpit noise environment was unsettling and further impacted the flight crewÂs concentration. Immediately after the stab trim cut-out switches were put back in normal position, the crew attempted another unsuccessful autopilot engagement as the plane was approaching 14000 ft. At the same time, the captain applied two brief electric trim up inputs of 1 second each while pulling on the control with an average force of 100 Lbs (45 kg). The force on the controls remained between 75 and 100 Lbs.  At 08:43:20, five seconds after the trim-up inputs, the fourth MCAS triggered. The plane started to descend. During the 9-second MCAS activation, the stabilizer decreased from 2.3 units to 1 unit of trim. The captain repeatedly shouted to the first officer to pitch up. The forces were physically unmanageable by both flight crews. The aircraft began pitching nose down.  The airplane hit the ground eighteen seconds after the end of the 4th MCAS. The investigation noted that intermittent flight control system abnormalities began well before the accident flight. Maintenance actions of relevance started occurring in December 2018 when the airplane was one month old and included several pilot write ups involving temporary fluctuations of vertical speed and altitude. There were also three reports of the airplane rolling during autopilot operation. Altitude and vertical speed indications on the PFD showed erratic and exaggerated indications.  From the maintenance log book report the airplane also suffered intermittent electrical/electronic anomalies in addition to the flight control system malfunctions. For example, three days before the crash the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) Fault Light illuminated, and the APU had a protective shutdown. The onboard maintenance function computer message also indicated the Start Converter Unit (SCU) showed the APUÂs start system was inoperative. The SCU is located in the electrical and electronics (E/E) compartment. The captainÂs personal computer power outlet also had no power. The possibility of intermittent electrical/electronic system defects were an underlying issue. The AOA sensor malfunction on the accident flight most likely occurred as the result of a power quality problem that resulted in the loss of power to the left AOA Sensor Heater. Evidence indicates the loss of power was likely due to a production related intermittent electrical/electronic failure involving the airplaneÂs Electrical Wiring Interconnection System (EWIS) and the AOA Sensor part. Probable cause of the accident Repetitive and uncommanded airplane-nose-down inputs from the MCAS due to erroneous AOA input, and its unrecoverable activation system which made the airplane dive with the rate of -33,000 ft/min close to the ground was the most probable cause of the accident. Contributing Factors 1. The MCAS design relied on a single AOA sensor, making it vulnerable to erroneous input from the sensor; 2. During the design process, Boeing failed to consider the potential for uncommanded activation of MCAS, but assumed that pilots would recognize and address it through normal use of the control column, manual electric trim, and the existing Runaway Stabilizer NNC. The OMB and Emergency AD issued after the Lion Air accident included additional guidance but did not have the intended effect of preventing another MCAS-related accident; 3. While Boeing considered the possibility of uncommanded MCAS activation as part of its FHA, it did not evaluate all the potential alerts and indications that could accompany a failure leading to an uncommanded MCAS; 4. The MCAS contribution to cumulative AOA effects was not assessed; 5. The combined effect of alerts and indications that impacted pilotÂs recognition and procedure prioritization were not evaluated by the Manufacturer; 6. Absence of AOA DISAGREE warning flag on the flight display panels (PFD); 7. The B737 MAX Crew difference CBT training prepared by Boeing and delivered to Pilots did not cover the MCAS system; 8. Failure by the manufacturer to design simulator training for pilots with regards to safety critical systems like MCAS with catastrophic consquences during undesired activation. 9. The manufacturer failed to provide procedures regarding MCAS operation to the crew during training or in the FCOM; 10. Failure by the manufacturer to address the safety critical questions raised by the airline which would have cleared out crew confusion and task prioritization.METAR: 05:00 UTC / 08:00 local time: HAAB 100500Z 06008KT 9999 FEW025 16/10 Q102906:00 UTC / 09:00 local time: HAAB 100600Z 07010KT 9999 FEW025 18/09 Q1029Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Ethiopia Report number: AI-01/19 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB Response to Final Aircraft Accident Investigation Report  BEA comments   Location  Images: photo (c) LLBG Spotter; Tel Aviv-Ben Gurion International Airport (TLV/LLBG); 08 February 2019; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) David Rubinstein; Nairobi-Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (NBO/HKJK); 22 December 2018 photo (c) David Rubinstein; near Addis Ababa; 22 December 2018 photo (c) Jean-Paul Coupin; Beirut-Rafic Hariri International Airport (BEY/OLBA); 04 February 2019 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

After completing an uneventful landing on sea ice near Tuktoyaktuk for scientific research, they flew the aircraft to Pelly Island located 50 miles to the West. The crew first completed two reconnaissance patterns above the sea ice surface to assess wind and surface conditions. The crew then conducted a final pass and chose an into-wind approach for landing on the sea ice, approximately 1 nautical mile from the island. The aircraft touched down on a smooth area of sea ice but then bounced into the air after contacting a drift perpendicular to the aircraftÂs heading. The aircraft impacted the base of a larger drift once it settled back onto the sea ice. The nose landing gear collapsed and the aircraft came to a stop shortly thereafter. The aircraft sustained very serious damage, with damage to multiple major components as a result of the impact with the snow drifts. No personnel were injured in the accident and all were subsequently evacuated to Inuvik, NT by civilian helicopter. The investigation concluded that the crew did not see the drifts during the two reconnaissance patterns, during the final pass, nor when on approach for landing. The high cirrus cloud layer that obscured the sun contributed to the difficulty in assessing the sea ice surface.Sources: CBC  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

The two pilots and two passengers were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and an instrument flight rules flight plan was filed for the flight that originated from Harrisburg-Capital City Airport, Pennsylvania, and was destined for Monongahela-Rostraver Airport, Pennsylvania.  According to the pilot, the airplane was on approach to Monongahela when he lowered the landing gear handle and heard a crunching noise. He noticed there were no green cockpit indicator lights to confirm that the landing gear was down and locked. The pilot then asked the co-pilot to circle the airport while he looked up the emergency procedures for extending the landing gear in the airplane flight manual. He tried to extend the landing gear manually, but it appeared to be jammed. The pilot and co-pilot discussed the situation and decided to fly to Arnold Palmer Regional Airport (LBE), Latrobe, Pennsylvania since the airport had a control tower and emergency equipment. The pilot flew by the tower and asked if tower personnel could see the landing gear down. The tower controller told him that the landing gear appeared to be down. During the subsequent landing roll , the left main landing gear collapsed, followed shortly by the right main landing gear. The airplane then slid to a stop on the centerline of the runway and the flight crew and passengers egressed the airplane. Examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed that the main landing gear mechanical linkage was compromised, and the right main landing gear actuator shaft was broken. The actuator was retained for further examination.

Both pilots sustained fatal injuries.  The two commercial pilots were conducting a personal, cross-country flight. As the airplane approached the approach end of the landing runway, it began to climb, rolled left, became inverted, and then impacted terrain. The left thrust reverser (T/R) was found open and unlatched at the accident site. An asymmetric deployment of the left T/R would have resulted in a left roll/yaw. The lack of an airworthy and operable cockpit voice recorder, which was required for the flight, precluded identifying which pilot was performing pilot flying duties, as well as other crew actions and background noises, that would have facilitated the investigation. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that it was not equipped, nor was required to be equipped, with a nose landing gear ground contact switch intended to preclude inflight operation of the thrust reverser. Further, electrical testing of the T/R left and right stow microswitches within the cockpit throttle quadrant revealed that the left stow microswitch did not operate within design specifications. Disassembly of the left and right stow microswitches revealed evidence of arc wear due to aging. Based on this information, it is likely that the airplaneÂs lack of an NLG ground contact switch and the age-related failure of the stow microswitches resulted in an asymmetric T/R deployment while on approach and a subsequent loss of airplane control. Also, there were additional T/R system components that were found to unairworthy that would have affected the control of the T/R system. Cause: The airplaneÂs unairworthy thrust reverser (T/R) system due to inadequate maintenance that resulted in an asymmetric T/R deployment during an approach to the airport and the subsequent loss of airplane control.METAR: 20:05 UTC / 15:05 local time: KHSD 182005Z AUTO 00000KT 10SM CLR 19/M02 A3026 RMK A0120:25 UTC / 15:25 local time: KHSD 182025Z AUTO 18007KT 10SM CLR 20/M02 A3025 RMK A0120:45 UTC / 15:45 local time: KHSD 182045Z AUTO VRB03KT 10SM CLR 20/M02 A3025 RMK A01Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN19FA104 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: kxii.com   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Oklahoma City-Sundance Airport, OK (HSD); 18 March 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Oklahoma City-Sundance Airport, OK (HSD); 18 March 2019; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The driver of the vehicle was critically injured and later died in hospital. During the night, three vehicles had been cleared to enter the runway for lighting maintenance work and centreline painting. Two vehicles were in contact with the Tower controller using walkie-talkies. At 01:30 a new Tower controller took over.  One of the vehicles reported vacating the runway at 02:15, with the controller assuming all vehicles had left. The controller on duty handed over his shift at 03:00 to another controller with the information that no more work on the runway was going on. There was also no indication of Work in Progress as a reminder on the flight progress strip bay at the tower console. At 03:08 the Challenger 9M-TST reported his position to the Tower controller while 9 miles out on a final ILS approach to runway 15 After looking out on the runway to check on any abnormal activities or unusual lighting, clearance for landing was given to 9M-TST after the controller was sure that the runway was clear for the aircraft to make a landing. When 9M-TST approach closer on its final approach, the leader of the contractor's worker saw the landing light of the aircraft approaching and realised that there was an aircraft coming in for a landing. All three workers boarded their vehicle and drove away from the runway. While making a 180 degrees turn, the driver realised the escorting vehicle was still static on the runway. They flashed the headlight of the vehicle several times to attract the escort vehicle attention. No response was observed from the escort vehicle, and as the aircraft was getting closer to them, the driver drove his vehicle away from the runway and stopped at taxiway Foxtrot to give way for the aircraft to land. After the aircraft had landed safely, while decelerating with a speed between 90 to 100 knots, the aircraft hit the stationary car. Probable Cause: Incorrect information of vehicle activities on the runway handed over to the taking over controller led to the landing clearance given without realising the runway is occupied.METAR: 19:00 UTC / 03:00 local time: WMSA 171900Z VRB03KT 7000 FEW025 BKN270 27/23 Q101120:00 UTC / 04:00 local time: WMSA 172000Z 00000KT 7000 FEW025 BKN280 27/23 Q1011Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Malaysia Report number: A 02/19 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: New Straits Times   Location  Images: photo (c) Alvin Tan Chun San; Bintulu Airport (BTU/WBGB); 17 September 2014 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The nosewheel steering bypass pin had been installed and the TLD 200MT lift tug was aligned with the aircraft nose landing gear main forging. The tug was being driven by a driver undergoing his first pushback in this model and type of tug, under the direct supervision of a trainer seated alongside in the cab. The tug was being brought forward using its laser guidance system and joystick and was at the point where the 'paddles' close around the nosewheels. Whilst this was taking place the trainer observed movement of the nose gear followed by a bang. The driver immediately stopped the procedure, the brakes were applied, and the trainer and driver exited the cab to investigate the cause of the bang. On inspection they found that the paddle on the left side of the aircraft had contacted, and damaged, the nut on the torque link centre pivot. There also was a significant witness mark on the paddle. They then informed the aircraft commander and the aircraft maintenance company. The scheduled flight was cancelled, and the aircraft taken out of service. There were no injuries reported by the passengers or the crews of the aircraft and tug. It is not clear why the event occurred. The handling company confirmed that the training and knowledge of the requirement to align with the nosewheels was in place. However,  in this case it is possible that a momentary lapse in concentration led to the system being aligned to the nose leg rather than the nose wheels. This error is likely to have gone unnoticed because the 10Â° to 15Â° offset of the nosewheels was not significant enough to indicate a problem.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: EW/G2019/03/11 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: AAIB  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates15-Mar-2024 20:37 ASN Updated [Source, Accident report, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight departed Vienna, Austria, at 10:03 hours local time, bound for Innsbruck. The first officer was Pilot Flying. Foehn conditions were already foreseeable at Innsbruck, but wind shears were not forecast. The en route and descent part of the flight were uneventful. At 10:50 the flight received landing clearance for runway 08 and wind information from the controller at Innsbruck: ""020 deg 11 kt...Kematen 070 deg 17, gusting 32, expect wind checks on final"" (Kernaten is a town located on the runway 08 approach path). Five minutes later the aircraft was on final approach at 30 ft above the ground at a speed (IAS) of about 141 kt. During the next two seconds, the aircraft quickly lost altitude and speed. The first officer noticed that the aircraft was ""pushed down"". The rate of descent was approximately 500-700 ft/min. The first officer increased the power, but at this point the aircraft was already touching down on the runway at a speed of 123 knots.  The first officer pulled up the nose of the aircraft, because of which the pitch angle of the aircraft rose to 7.65Â° when touching down. The rate of descent decreased to approximately 200-500 ft/min by the time of touchdown. The maximum vertical acceleration (along the yaw axis) when touching down was 2.1 g.  A post-landing inspection showed damage to the underside of the rear fuselage, which had touched the runway. On the inside of the rear of the fuselage, stringers and frames were broken and bent. The aircraft was repaired and resumed service on June 4, two months after the accident.

Kennedy International Airport, NY (JFK/KJFK)","Los Angeles International Airport, CA (LAX/KLAX)"," NTSB","Accident investigation report completed and information captured","American Airlines flight 300, an Airbus A321, experienced a left roll during takeoff from runway 31L at New York's JFK Airport.  During the left roll, the airplaneÂs left wingtip struck the ground and a runway distance marker on the left side of the runway. The flight crew completed the takeoff and safely returned to the airport 28 minutes later.  The wind at the time resulted in a 14- to 17-knot crosswind from the right, which was below the companyÂs 35-knot crosswind limitation. The initial takeoff roll proceeded normally, with the captain (the pilot flying) applying left rudder pedal to counter the right crosswind. The captain stated that he kept the airplane near the runway centerline and that ""everything was ok"" when the airplane reached 80 knots. When the airplane reached the rotation speed of 156 knots while still on the ground, the captain made a large left rudder pedal input, from 8Â° to 25Â°, during a 1.5-second timeframe. In response to this large rudder pedal input, the airplaneÂs heading deviated to the left, and its lateral acceleration increased to a maximum of 0.32 G. During a postaccident interview, the captain stated the airplane made a ""significant"" turn to the left. The captain also stated that he was ""looking at the runway edge"" and knew he had to get the airplane into the air. Digital flight data recorder (DFDR) data showed that the sidestick was pulled to its full nose-up position and a right sidestick position. During the aft sidestick and right sidestick application to rotate the airplane, the rudder remained close to its full-left deflection for 3 seconds. As the nose of the airplane lifted off the ground, the airplane began to roll to the left, and the left roll rate accelerated as the main landing gear lifted off the ground, reaching a maximum of 37Â° left wing down as the captain moved the rudder and sidestick to full right and to full aft. These movements arrested the left roll and allowed the airplane to continue to lift off. The large left roll angle immediately after liftoff resulted in the left wingtip striking the ground and a runway distance marker, part of which remained imbedded in the wingtip.  No airplane flight control abnormalities were noted, except for a left aileron deflection as the left wingtip scraped the ground. Thus, the left roll that occurred was in response to the captainÂs left rudder pedal input during rotation of the airplane. Probable cause: The captainÂs excessive left rudder pedal input during the takeoff ground roll, which caused a large heading deviation and a left roll upon rotation that resulted in the left wingtip striking the ground.METAR: 00:51 UTC / 20:51 local time: KJFK 110051Z 36017KT 10SM SCT250 10/M03 A2998 RMK AO2 SLP153 T01001028 23:51 UTC / 21:51 local time: KJFK 102351Z 33015KT 10SM FEW070 FEW250 11/M03 A2996 RMK AO2 PK WND 34026/2257 SLP145 T01111028 10161 20111 53034Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA19LA134 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Flightaware track  ABC7NY   Location  Images: photo (c) Seat 16A; New York-John F.

The flight was operating under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 121 as a regularly scheduled passenger flight from the George Bush Intercontinental Airport (KIAH), Houston, Texas, to KRSW.   After touchdown on runway 24, the aft galley oven became dislodged, and the aft galley flight attendant attempted to restrain it causing her injury. After taxiing to the gate and deplaning, the flight attendant was treated by emergency medical personnel and transported to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a fractured left forearm.  Post flight examination found multiple attach screws on the bottom of the oven were missing, which allowed the oven to slide out of its compartment during the landing. Subsequent to the accident, the operator conducted a fleet inspection of the oven housing attach screws. Probable Cause: missing attach screws on the aft galley oven, which allowed it to become dislodged landing, injuring a flight attendant.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA19CA137 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA19CA137 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  4 March 2024 N31412 United Airlines 0 E of Houston-George Bush Intercontinental Airport, TX (IAH/KIAH) unk Engine failure Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates05-Jun-2022 13:13 ASN Update Bot Added 23-Sep-2023 04:28 Ron Averes Updated Corrections or additions? ...

The aircraft was bound for Hamilton-Marion County Airport (HAB), Alabama. At 15:06 the flight reported climbing through 1300 ft. ATC notified the flight of moderate to severe precipitation in the area of UOX and provided a clearance to 11000 ft MSL. At 15:08 ATC queried the flight for their altitude and informed the flight of moderate to heavy precipitation along their route of flight. The flight acknowledged the radio call and informed ATC they were climbing through 9000 ft for 11000 ft. About 15:12 ATC queried the flight if they were having navigation issues or if they were deviating. The flight responded they were deviating and that they were having ""AC voltage problems."" The last radio call received from the flight was an acknowledgement of a heading assignment to 095 at 15:13. The airplane disappeared from radar about 30 seconds later and the ATC controller tried unsuccessfully to raise the flight on the radio at that time. Preliminary radar data began tracking the airplane at 15:06. The airplane transponder stopped transmitting Mode 3A information about 15:08, so no altitude information was available for the remainder of the flight. The airplane maintained an approximate heading of 080 from 15:06 until about 15:10. At 15:10 the airplane turned right to about 120 heading. At 15:12 the airplane made a left turn to about 040 heading. At 15:13 the airplane began a right turn that continued to a heading of about 270 until radar contact was lost at 15:13:26. The final radar return was about .5 miles southeast of the accident location.

The aircraft and helicopter were destroyed. One helicopter (Shree Airlines Eurocopter AS 350, 9N-ALK) sustained minor damage.  The copilot of the Summit Air plane sustained fatal injuries. Two persons on the ground at the helipad also died in the accident. The L-410 was repositioning to Ramechhap after flying passengers and cargo to Lukla. The captain taxied the aircraft to threshold of runway 24 and handed over control to the co-pilot. Within 3 seconds of the takeoff roll the aircraft veered to the right and exited the runway, travelling about 43 ft across the grassy part on right side of runway 24, before striking the airport inner perimeter fence. It then continued to skid for about 43 ft, and hit two persons before it crashed into the upper helipad. It struck the turning rotor blades of 9N-ALC. The moving rotors cut through the cockpit and the helicopter toppled onto the lower helipad 6 ft below. The left-hand  wing of the aircraft broke the skid of another helicopter, 9N-ALK, and came to a halt with 9N-ALC beneath its right-hand  main wheel assembly Lukla Airport is located on a mountain at an elevation of 9334 feet (2845 m). The runway is 1729 ft long (527 m) with an 11.7% gradient. Takeoffs must be performed from the downsloping runway 24. The helipad is located to the right of the runway, about 100 meters past the threshold. Probable Cause The commission concluded that the probable cause of the accident was aircraft's veering towards right during initial take-off roll as a result of asymmetric power due to abrupt shifting of right power lever rearwards and failure to abort the takeoff by crew. There were not enough evidences to determine the exact reason for abrupt shifting of the power lever. Contributing Factors 1. Failure of the PF(being a less experienced co-pilot) to immediately assess and act upon the abrupt shifting of the right power lever resulted in aircraft veering to the right causing certain time lapse for PIC to take controls in order to initiate correction. 2. PIC's attempted corrections of adding power could not correct the veering. Subsequently, application of brakes resulted in asymmetric braking due to the position of the pedals, and further contributed veering towards right.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Nepal AAIC Report number: AAIR-076/1 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Kathmandu Post   Location  Images: photo (c) Nepal AAIC; Lukla-Tenzing-Hillary Airport (LUA/VNLK); 14 April 2019 photo (c) Nepal AAIC; Lukla-Tenzing-Hillary Airport (LUA/VNLK); 14 April 2019 photo (c) Nepal AAIC; Lukla-Tenzing-Hillary Airport (LUA/VNLK); 14 April 2019 photo (c) David Russell; Kathmandu-Tribhuvan Airport (KTM/VNKT); 14 October 2018 photo (c) Oleg Belaychuk; Lukla-Tenzing-Hillary Airport (LUA/VNLK); 05 November 2018 photo (c) Oleg Belaychuk; Lukla-Tenzing-Hillary Airport (LUA/VNLK); 05 November 2018 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The torque tube assembly of the aircraft's controls had been wrongly installed, causing a flight control reversal.  The aircraft departed SchÃ¶nefeld Airport on a Functional Check Flight and the flight crew soon noticed flight control problems. The aircraft entered steep turns and was exposed to forces of up to +5G. The crew managed to return to SchÃ¶nefeld Airport where an emergency landing was carried out.  In September 2019 it was announced that the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. The Global 5000 accident, that took place at Berlin-SchÃ¶nefeld on April 16, 2019, was the result of a series of omissions and errors that originated in different core areas, and involved many people either directly or indirectly. The technical error that occurred during the installation and adjustment procedure of the RCIMs [Roll Control Input-Modules] represents the event triggering the accident. The system design further enabled this failure, which allowed the RCIMs to be installed and adjusted in such a manner that the MFS [multi-function spoilers] functioned opposite of the corresponding input, and generated no error messages on the EICAS or the PMAT. Since the maintenance crew relied solely upon the EICAS warnings and the results given by the PMAT, the error remained undetected in the tests following the installation.Sources: Bundeswehr-Jet wird nach Bruchlandung vom April ausgemustert (focus.de, 4-9-2019)  Totalschaden am Kanzlerjet (spiegel.de, 3-9-2019)  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

A captain in training assumed the role of pilot-in-command (PIC) and Piot Flying while the line indoctrination captain acted as first officer (FO) and Pilot Monitoring on the flight. The FO conducted a pre-flight inspection of the aircraft and noted that the aircraft had about 1600 pounds of fuel on board. Because he preferred to order fuel directly from a fuel technician, he went to the fuel office in the hangar, but could not find anyone to take the fuel order. Intending to return to the office later, he went to the lounge where he found out that the flight would be delayed pending the arrival of the 2nd flight nurse. When the captain asked if the aircraft was ready for the flight, the FO replied that it was. When preparing for departure, the flight crew completed the BEFORE START checklist. The last step on the checklist was to start the engine. The flight crew then taxied to a run-up area and began the AFTER START checklist. When the FO read out the checklist item FUEL QUANTITY, the captain responded with the text that was printed on the checklist, ""SUFFICIENT/BALANCED,"" but he did not check the fuel quantity indicators. When the checklist was complete, the crew taxied to the runway. The aircraft departed CYWG at 16:39. Roughly 8 NM after the takeoff, while still in the climb, the captain performed a progressive fuel calculation. He did not look at the fuel quantity indicators during the process. The aircraft continued the climb and levelled off at flight level (FL) 250. During the rest of the flight, neither pilot performed periodic scans of the fuel quantity indicators. At 18:13, when the aircraft was about 14 NM west-northwest of Gillam Airport (CYGX) and still level at FL 250, the left fuel pressure (L FUEL PRESS) warning light illuminated, indicating low fuel. The warning was followed almost immediately by power surging in the left engine. The captain turned the boost pump ON, and noticed that the fuel quantity indicators were showing 0 pounds. The captain asked the FO about the fuel quantity, at which point the FO realized that he had forgotten to order fuel. The flight crew declared an emergency with the Winnipeg Area Control Centre (ACC) at 18:14 and began an emergency descent. The weather conditions at CYYQ were marginal, so the decision was made to divert to the alternate aerodrome, CYGX; however, the aircraft continued on the same heading toward CYYQ for another 2 minutes By 18:15, when the aircraft was at FL 220, the left engine had exhausted its fuel supply and lost power. The crew conducted the emergency engine shutdown procedure in the Emergency and Abnormal Procedures Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) to shut down the engine; however, the left propeller continued to windmill at speeds between 1300 and 2000 rpm throughout the ensuing descent. At 18:15:32, the FO programmed the FMS to display a track to CYGX and instructed the captain to turn right and follow the track. The FO moved the heading bugs, which were coupled on both FMS displays, to the CYGX heading. The captain then initiated a right turn toward CYGX. The captain reduced the power setting of the right engine. From 18:15 to 18:18, the rate of descent varied between 3000 and 6000 fpm. The crew extended the landing gear in an attempt to set up a suitable descent angle to Runway 23. At 18:17, the flight crew informed the ACC that the nature of the emergency was fuel related. The ACC provided the flight crew with the weather at CYGX and informed them that emergency services at CYGX would be notified. As the aircraft descended through approximately 5000 feet above sea level (ASL), the FO obtained a vertical navigation (VNAV) profile to Runway 23 on the FMS. The crew retracted the landing gear as the aircraft intercepted the VNAV path.  By 18:20, the airspeed had decayed to approximately 100 knots and the captain was having difficulty controlling the aircraft. At times, the aircraft was descending below the VNAV path. Seeing this, the FO took over control and assumed the Pilot Flying duties. At 18:21, as the aircraft descended through 2800 feet ASL, the left propeller ceased windmilling as the rpm decreased from 1300 to 0 rpm. The flight crew made a Mayday call at 18:21:30 on the CYGX mandatory frequency. When the aircraft was at approximately 2000 feet ASL, it descended below the cloud base and the FO was able to visually identify CYGX. At 18:22:34, when the aircraft was at 1300 feet ASL, roughly 835 feet above ground level (AGL), the right engine lost power. The aircraft could no longer maintain the VNAV path or a suitable visual approach to the runway. When the aircraft was at about 530 feet AGL and 1 NM from the runway, the crew shut down and feathered the right engine while continuing the right-hand curving visual approach to Runway 23. The flaps remained up throughout the approach and subsequent landing. The crew selected the landing gear DOWN when the aircraft was at about 50 feet AGL and the aircraft touched down on the frozen surface of Stephens Lake with the landing gear fully extended. Sufficient airspeed remained to enable the FO to raise the nose as the aircraft approached the rocky shoreline at the approach end of Runway 23. The aircraft struck the rocky shoreline in a nose-high attitude and skidded up onto the right edge of the runway area, coming to rest approximately 190 feet before the threshold . Findings as to causes and contributing factors 1. When the captain asked if the aircraft was ready for the flight, the first officer replied that it was, not recalling that the aircraft required fuel. 2. While performing the FUEL QUANTITY item on the AFTER START checklist, the captain responded to the first officerÂs prompt with the rote response that the fuel was sufficient, without looking at the fuel gauges. 3. The aircraft departed Winnipeg/James Armstrong Richardson International Airport with insufficient fuel on board to complete the planned flight. 4. The flight crew did not detect that there was insufficient fuel because the gauges had not been included in the periodic cockpit scans. 5. When the flight crew performed the progressive fuel calculation, they did not confirm the results against the fuel gauges, and therefore their attention was not drawn to the low-fuel state at a point that would have allowed for a safe landing. 6. Still feeling the effect of the startle response to the fuel emergency, the captain quickly became task saturated, which led to an uncoordinated response by the flight crew, delaying the turn toward Gillam Airport, and extending the approach. 7. The right engine lost power due to fuel exhaustion when the aircraft was 1 nautical mile from Runway 23. From that position, a successful forced landing on the intended runway was no longer possible and, as a result, the aircraft touched down on the ice surface of Stephens Lake, short of the runway.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A19C0038 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: CTV News  Winnipeg Sun  TSB   Location  Images: photo (c) RCMP; Gillam Airport, MB (YGX); 24 April 2019 photo (c) TSB Canada; Gillam Airport, MB (YGX); 24 April 2019 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

It was a training flight to acquire the type rating for the aircraft. The right pilot's seat was occupied by the pilot in command, who was deployed on this flight as a flight instructor. The student pilot, as co-pilot, sat on the left pilot seat and was the pilot flying. For the co-pilot it was the second flight day of his practical training program on the Cessna 551 Citation II/SP. The day before, he had already completed about three flying hours on the plane. At Siegerland Airport, three precision approaches to runway 31 were carried out with the help of the Instrument Landing System (ILS). After the third landing, the tower, due to the changed wind, turned the landing direction to runway 13. The cockpit crew therefore rolled the aircraft to the end of the runway, turned and took off at 14:34 from runway 13. This was followed by a left-hand circuit at an altitude of 3,500 ft AMSL. The approach to runway 13 took place under visual flight conditions. According to both pilots, the checklists were processed during the circuit and the aircraft was prepared for landing on runway 13. In the final approach, the landing configuration was then established and the landing checklist performed. The copilot reported that shortly before the landing the speed decreased, the aircraft flew too low and the approach angle had to be corrected. He pushed the engine thrust levers forward to the stop. The pilot in command supported this action by also pushing the engine thrust levers forward with his hand. However, according to the pilot in command, the remaining time to touch down on the runway was no longer sufficient for the engines to accelerate to maximum speed in order to deliver the corresponding thrust. He also described that the aircraft had been in the stall area at that time. However, he had not noticed a stall warning. At 14:42, with the landing gear extended, the aircraft touched down in the grass in front of the asphalt area of runway 13. The left main landing gear buckled and damaged the tank of the left wing. The right main landing gear also buckled, the tank on the right side remained undamaged. The kerosene escaping from the left wing ignited and a fire broke out. The aircraft burned and slipped along runway 13 on the folded landing gear, the underside of the airframe and the extended landing flaps until it came to a standstill after a distance of approx. 730 m from runway threshold 13. After the plane had come to a standstill on the runway, the copilot noticed flames on the left side of the plane. The pilot switched off both engines. Then both pilots left the plane via the emergency exit door on the right side. The pilots were not injured. Conclusions: The accident, in which the aircraft touched down in front of the runway threshold, was due to an unstabilized approach and failure to initiate a go around maneuver. The following factors contributed to the accident: - The formation of the aerodrome circuit was too close to the airfield. - The final approach was flown too short and performed in a manner that resulted in an unstabilized approach. - During the final approach, the approach angle was not maintained correctly to the runway threshold. - The airspeed on final approach was too low. - Both pilots had not recognized the speed drop early enough and had not increased the engine power in time. - The flight instructor had intervened too late and thus the aircraft attitude was not brought under control in time. An additional contributing factor was the rising terrain ahead of the runway threshold. The student pilot most likely had the impression of being too high and deliberately kept the approach angle flat.METAR: 11:20 UTC / 13:20 local time: EDGS 241120Z 22006KT 110V240 9999 FEW048 19/07 Q100312:20 UTC / 14:20 local time: EDGS 241220Z 22006KT 100V240 CAVOK 21/08 Q100313:20 UTC / 15:20 local time: EDGS 241320Z 15007KT 110V200 CAVOK 20/08 Q1002Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BFU Report number: BFU19-0411-3X Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Fahrwerk beim Landeanflug abgerissen: Kleiner Jet fÃ¤ngt am Siegerland-Flughafen Feuer (wa.de, 24-4-2019)  Video Â Cessna geht nach Bruchlandung in Flammen auf (wirsiegen.de, 24-4-2019)  Flightradar24 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  5 October 2008 D-IADV Advance Air (AXX) 0 Sylt Airport (GWT/EDXW) sub Location  Images: photo (c) Alec Wilson; Birmingham International Airport (BHX/EGBB); 24 May 2013; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

After departure, while the aircraft was climbing through 1200 feet above sea level on the way to a cruising altitude of 5000 feet, the flight crew completed the after-takeoff checklist and applied carburetor heat to 20 Â°C. While the First Officer (FO) was applying the carburetor heat, oil pressure was observed decreasing on the left engine (Pratt & Whitney R-1830-92). Moments later, rising cylinder head temperature and oil temperature indications were also observed on the left engine. The captain directed the FO to contact the area control centre to declare a PAN PAN emergency and request a return to CYHY, which the FO then did. The aircraft flight manual (AFM) does not contain any procedures for abnormal engine indications. As the aircraft reached an altitude of 1969 feet, the captain set the left engine to a reduced power setting and increased the power on the right engine to maximum except takeoff (METO) power. The flight crew began to set up for an instrument landing system approach to CYHY via TANPO. At 07:47, while the aircraft was in a right turn proceeding towards TANPO, smoke and oil were observed, and abnormal sounds were heard coming from the left engine. Using the engine failure checklist, the flight crew then shut down the left engine and feathered the propeller. At 07:48, because the situation had escalated, a MAYDAY emergency was declared. Moments later, the flight crew completed the descent checklist and initiated the approach checklist. However, due to the escalating emergency, the flight crew was not able to complete the approach checklist, which included the landing briefing. At 07:53, the aircraft levelled off at 1214 feet. The FO observed zero hydraulic pressure on the landing gear DOWN gauge. Thinking this zero pressure was an issue, he mentioned it to the captain, who then directed the FO to ""prep the gear."" The FO extended the landing gear, which the captain did not expect because the aircraft had not started its final approach and the airport had not been visually acquired. At 07:55, as the aircraft continued towards TANPO, the altitude was between 1200 and 1300 feet ASL, and the airspeed was maintained at approximately 100 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS). When the aircraft was abeam TANPO, the captain began a right turn to intercept the localizer for the final approach. The aircraftÂs airspeed decreased from 100 KIAS to 80 KIAS, while its altitude decreased to 1100 feet ASL. With the reduced airspeed, the aircraftÂs flight control response became sluggish and the captain directed the landing gear to be raised. After the landing gear was raised, at 07:59, the flight crew heard abnormal sounds and felt vibrations from the right engine. The aircraftÂs airspeed was 80 KIAS, and its altitude began to decrease to below 800 feet ASL.   In an attempt to maintain altitude, the right engine was increased to maximum takeoff power, but this had no effect. The flight crew then prepared for an emergency gear-up landing, and the aircraftÂs flaps were lowered on short final to reduce speed for touchdown. At 08:01, the aircraft landed in muskeg on KÂatlÂOdeeche First Nation land, approximately 3.5 nautical miles southeast of CYHY. After the aircraft came to a stop, the FO exited the aircraft through the right-hand crew window, while the captain remained in the cockpit to secure the right engine and aircraft systems before evacuating via the forward door. The FO contacted the flight information centre to notify them of the crewÂs status and aircraft location. The emergency locator transmitter had not activated during the forced landing, so the FO activated it manually to assist search and rescue in locating the aircraft. The flight crew was uninjured. The aircraft received substantial damage. There was no post-impact fire. First responders arrived at the accident site at 11:14 In this occurrence, the aircraftÂs airspeed and altitude could not be maintained, primarily because of the increased drag when the landing gear was extended early in the approach.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A19W0052 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: cabinradio.ca  cbc.ca   Location  Images: photo (c) TSB Canada; near Hay River Airport, NT (YHY); May 2019; (CC:by-nc-nd) photo (c) TSB Canada; near Hay River Airport, NT (YHY); May 2019; (CC:by-nc-nd) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane came to rest in the shallow waters of St. Johns River, sustaining substantial damage. The 143 passengers and crew survived. The aircraft was engaged in a charter flight to bring military personnel and family members home. The No. 1 (left) thrust reverser was not operational and deferred for the flight in accordance with the airplaneÂs minimum equipment list. The captain was the pilot flying for the accident flight, and the first officer was the pilot monitoring. The captain was also performing check airman duties for the first officer who was in the process of completing operating experience training. Flight 293 departed GuantÃ¡namo Bay at 23:19 UTC. At 21:22 local time the pilot checked in with a Jacksonville approach (JAX) controller while level at 13,000 ft mean sea level and was provided the JAX altimeter setting; the controller advised the pilot to expect the RNAV runway 28 approach and moderate-to-heavy precipitation on the final approach to runway 28 (9000 ft/2743 m long). At 21:23, the JAX controller advised the pilot that the winds at KNIP were from 350Â° at 4 knots; the pilot then asked if there was any chance of getting runway 10 because it looked a little better. The JAX controller responded that he was showing moderate-to-heavy precipitation building over runway 10 starting about 5 miles on final. The pilot acknowledged and said he would stick with runway 28.  He was then instructed to descend and maintain 5,000 ft. At 21:25, the controller provided additional weather information to the flight crew, stating that moderate-to-heavy precipitation was present east and west of the airport. The pilot elected to continue for an approach to runway 28. At 21:30, the JAX controller advised the pilot that the flight was heading northbound and the precipitation was moving eastbound; the controller then asked the pilot if he would like to try runway 10 since it might be better. The pilot acknowledged ""yeah go ahead, letÂs do it."" The controller then instructed the pilot to turn left to a heading of 270Â°, and the pilot acknowledged.   Over the next several minutes, the flight was vectored for the approach to runway 10. At 21:37, the JAX controller cleared the flight for the RNAV runway 10 approach, and the pilot acknowledged.  Shortly after, the flight was transferred to the KNIP radar controller. The pilot contacted the KNIP radar controller, and, at 21:39, the KNIP radar controller indicated the winds were from 240Â° at 10 knots; he then cleared the flight to land on runway 10.  As the airplane descended through 1,390 ft mean sea level (msl), the pilots configured it for landing with the flaps set at 30Â° and the landing gear extended; however, the speedbrake handle was not placed in the armed position as specified in the Landing checklist. At an altitude of about 1,100 ft msl and 2.8 nm from the runway, the airplane was slightly above the glidepath, and its airspeed was on target. Over the next minute, the indicated airspeed increased to 170 knots (17 knots above the target approach speed), and groundspeed reached 180 knots, including an estimated 7-knot tailwind. At an altitude of about 680 ft msl and 1.6 nm from the threshold, the airplane deviated further above the 3Â° glidepath such that the precision approach path indicator (PAPI) lights would have appeared to the flight crew as four white lights and would retain that appearance throughout the rest of the approach. Eight seconds before touchdown, multiple enhanced ground proximity warning system alerts announced ""sink rate"" as the airplaneÂs descent rate peaked at 1,580 fpm. The airplane crossed the displaced threshold 120 ft above the runway and 17 knots above the target approach speed, with a groundspeed of 180 knots and a rate of descent about 1,450 ft per minute (fpm). The airplane touched down about 1,580 ft beyond the displaced threshold, which was 80 ft beyond the designated touchdown zone as specified in the operatorÂs standard operating procedures (SOP). After touchdown, the captain deployed the No. 2 engine thrust reverser and began braking; he later reported, however, that he did not feel the aircraft decelerate and increased the brake pressure. The speedbrakes deployed about 4 seconds after touchdown, most likely triggered by the movement of the right throttle into the idle reverse thrust detent after main gear tire spinup. The automatic deployment of the speedbrakes was likely delayed by about 3 seconds compared to the automatic deployment that could have been obtained by arming the speedbrakes before landing. The airplane crossed the end of the runway about 55 ft right of the centerline and impacted a seawall 90 ft to the right of the centerline, 9,170 ft beyond the displaced threshold, and 1,164 ft beyond the departure end of runway 10. After the airplane came to rest in St. Johns River, the flight crew began an emergency evacuation. The airplane was mostly intact, but both main landing gear had separated from the airplane and were also located in the river. Probable Cause and Findings An extreme loss of braking friction due to heavy rain and the water depth on the ungrooved runway, which resulted in viscous hydroplaning. Contributing to the accident was the operatorÂs inadequate guidance for evaluating runway braking conditions and conducting en route landing distance assessments. Contributing to the continuation of an unstabilized approach were 1) the captainÂs plan continuation bias and increased workload due to the weather and performing check airman duties and 2) the first officerÂs lack of experience.METAR: 01:05 UTC / 21:05 local time: KNIP 040105Z COR 08003KT 10SM -TSRA SCT008 BKN030CB BKN045 BKN250 25/23 A2997 RMK AO2 TSB04 OCNL LTGIC VC W TS W MOV E T1 SET P0000 T02500228 $01:22 UTC / 21:22 local time: KNIP 040122Z 35004KT 5SM +TSRA BR SCT008 BKN018CB OVC030 24/22 A2998 RMK AO2 TSB04 FRQ LTGIC OHD TS OHD MOV E T1 SET P0010 T02440222 $01:45 UTC / 21:45 local time: KNIP 040145Z 29008G16KT 3SM +TSRA BR SCT008 BKN015CB OVC032 24/22 A2999 RMK AO2 TSB04 FRQ LTGIC OHD TS OHD MOV E T1 SET P0063 T02440222 $01:53 UTC / 21:53 local time: KNIP 040153Z 13003KT 2SM +TSRA BR SCT010 BKN021CB OVC035 23/21 A2998 RMK AO2 TSB04 SLP149 FRQ LTGIC OHD TS OHD MOV E T1 SET P0074 T02280206 $Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA19FA143 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Flightaware track  NTSB History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  27 September 2012 N732MA Miami Air International 0 Concord Regional Airport, NC (KJQF) non Taxiway excursion Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Jacksonville Naval Air Station, FL (NIP); 04 May 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Jacksonville Naval Air Station, FL (NIP); 04 May 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Jacksonville Naval Air Station, FL (NIP); May 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Jacksonville Naval Air Station, FL (NIP); May 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Jacksonville Naval Air Station, FL (NIP); May 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) Jaime Escobar Corradine; Miami International Airport, FL (MIA/KMIA); 14 January 2011 photo (c) Victor Vu; Columbia Regional Airport, MO (COU/KCOU); 18 November 2016 photo (c) Harro Ranter/ASN; Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS/EHAM); 30 August 2016 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft was chartered to fly passengers from Monterrey to Las Vegas to visit a boxing match. At 14:52 hours local time (21:52 UTC) the aircraft took off from Las Vegas on the return leg to Monterrey. The planned flight time was two hours and thirty minutes. At 23:24 UTC, the flight contacted Monterrey ACC, requesting permission to climb to FL390. This was approved. Nine minutes later the aircraft entered the green zone of the weather system that was ahead. This caused an increase in turbulence with vertical acceleration values of between 1.40 and 0.68 g. The crew then requested to climb to FL410, which was the maximum certified operating altitude for the aircraft. This request was also approved by Monterrey ACC. At 23:37:00 UTC, the aircraft entered the core of the most intense part of the weather system. The turbulence began to become more severe. The aircraft became almost weightless, registering 0.04g followed immediately by a positive load of 1.52 g. The roll attitude oscillated from left to right with magnitudes up to 18 degrees. These conditions continued for the next sixteen seconds, during which time, the aircraft continued to climb on the same heading. At 23:37:18 UTC, the aircraft encountered a massive disturbance in the air mass that produced a negative vertical acceleration of -1.98 g, followed by +2.40g. This encounter lasted almost three seconds. The aircraft then encountered another massive disturbance, causing loads of -1.88g, followed by a sustained load in excess of 2.74 g. Four seconds after this encounter, the aircraft reached a right roll of 90 degrees and the altitude rapidly climbed to FL425. At this point the aircraft was out of control. At 23:37:27 UTC, the aircraft's altitude excursion peaked at FL448. At this point, the aircraft was inverted and banked sixty degrees, nose down. It began a rapid descent, while rolling wings level. At 23:37:31 UTC, the aircraft rolled inverted once again with a high rate of roll and continued to descend rapidly through FL404 in a flat spin.  It then impacted terrain at an elevation of 1088 m. Probable Cause: ""Impact with terrain with wings level, after a loss of control due to rapid climb and inversion of the aircraft caused by entry into severe atmospheric instability, inducing both engines to shut down"". Contributing Factors: - Inadvertent entry into severe atmospheric instability zone. - Not having the necessary information from the aircraft's weather radar system for undetermined reasons.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIDAIA Mexico Report number: ACCDTAFA019/2019MMMV Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: jornada.com.mx  Flightaware track log  eldiariodecoahuila.com.mx   Location  Images: photo (c) Darrell Sodergren; Teterboro Airport, NJ (TEB/KTEB); 04 January 2014 photo (c) Darrell Sodergren; London-Luton Airport (LTN/EGGW); 20 October 2010 photo (c) Darrell Sodergren; Farnborough Airport (FAB/EGLF); 06 March 2013 photo (c) Darrell Sodergren; Opa-locka Airport, FL (OPF/KOPF); 27 November 2010 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Of the 78 persons on board, 41 did not survive. The aircraft took off from Sheremetyevo Airport's runway 24C at 18:03 hours local time on a scheduled service to Murmansk, Russia. Visibility was fine but there were some Cumulonimbus clouds near the airfield at 6000 feet. The flight crew engaged the autopilot as the aircraft climbed through a height of 700 ft (215 m). At 18:08, as the aircraft was climbing through an altitude of about 8900 ft (2700 m), a failure occurred in the electrical system. At this point, the aircraft was 30 km west-northwest of the airport in an area of thunderstorm activity. The captain assumed manual control of the aircraft and the crew managed to establish radio contact using UHF. The flight was not able to contact the approach controller and subsequently selected the emergency transponder code 7600 (loss of radio communication). About 18:17 the aircraft overshot the runway centreline after turning to runway heading. Altitude at that time was about 2400 feet. The aircraft continued the right-hand turn, completed a circle and proceeded on the final approach for runway 24L. Flaps were selected at 25Â°, which was the recommended setting for landing above maximum landing weight. At 18:26 the flight crew selected the emergency transponder code 7700 (emergency). When descending from 335 to 275 m (1100-900 ft) the windshear warning system sounded five times: ""Go around. Windshear ahead"". From a height of 80 m (260 ft) above ground level, the aircraft descended below the glide path and at a height of 55 m (180 ft) the TAWS warning sounded: ""Glide Slope."" From that moment on the airspeed increased to 170 knots. At 18:30 the aircraft overflew the runway threshold and touched down at a distance of 900 m past the threshold at a speed of 158 knots. Touchdown occurred at a g-force of at least 2.55g with a subsequent bounce to a height of about 2 m. After two seconds the aircraft landed again on the nose landing gear with a vertical load 5.85g, and bounced to a height of 6 m. The third landing of the aircraft occurred at a speed of 140 knots with a vertical overload of at least 5g. This caused a rupture of the wing structure and fuel lines. Flames erupted and engulfed the rear of the aircraft. The aircraft slid to a stop on the grass between runway 24L and two taxiways. An emergency evacuation was then carried out while flames quickly engulfed the rear fuselage.METAR: 15:00 UTC / 18:00 local time: UUEE 051500Z 14003G08MPS 9999 FEW060CB 17/13 Q1012 R24L/290045 R24C/290045 NOSIG15:30 UTC / 18:30 local time: UUEE 051530Z 17007MPS 9999 SCT060CB 17/11 Q1012 R24L/290045 R24C/290045 NOSIG16:00 UTC / 19:00 local time: UUEE 051600Z 16004MPS 9999 -SHRA SCT055CB 16/11 Q1012 R24L/290045 R24C/290045 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number:  Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: Russian Ministry of Transport  TASS   Location  Images: photo (c) Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation; Moskva-Sheremetyevo Airport (SVO); 05 May 2019 photo (c) Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation; Moskva-Sheremetyevo Airport (SVO); 05 May 2019 photo (c) Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation; Moskva-Sheremetyevo Airport (SVO); 05 May 2019 photo (c) Flightradar24; Moskva-Sheremetyevo Airport (SVO); 05 May 2019 photo (c) Flightaware.com; Moskva-Sheremetyevo Airport (SVO); 05 May 2019 photo (c) Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation; Moskva-Sheremetyevo Airport (SVO); 05 May 2019 photo (c) Anna Zvereva; Tallinn-Ãlemiste Airport (TLL/EETN); 06 October 2017; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) Miklos Szabo; Budapest Ferenc Liszt International Airport (BUD/LHBP); 16 May 2018; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates09-Oct-2024 13:56 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft departed Dhaka-Shahjalal International Airport, Bangladesh, as Biman flight 060 about 15:15 hours local time with destination Yangon-Mingaladon Airport in Myanmar. Weather at Yangon was poor due to the presence of a thunderstorm in the area.  While the flight crew was performing an ILS approach, the controller instructed them to go around as the airport was closed due to weather. When the weather condition got better, the flight was cleared for an RNP approach to runway 21 because only the localizer was available at that moment. The co-pilot was Pilot Flying and the captain was Pilot Monitoring. The aircraft was higher than the 3 degree approach path and the airspeed fluctuated between 136 and 151 kts, which was than the 122 kts target airspeed. The captain said ""continue, continue"" to the copilot and the approach was continued. At an altitude of 22 feet over the runway, the captain began pushing the control column forward, while the PF was attempting to pull on the control column. At 1828 m down the runway, with 1585 m remaining, the aircraft briefly skipped a few times before getting airborne again. The captain then stated: ""I have control"", which was confirmed by the co-pilot. While in the air, the captain applied the brake pedal several times. At a height of 44 feet, the captain put the propellers in beta range and reduced the power lever angle to 18 degrees. The aircraft sank again and collided with runway 03 and slid forward. It left the runway and came to a complete stop in the over-run area. The aircraft fuselage broke in just behind the forward passenger door and just behind the rear service door. The undercarriage collapsed and the right hand wing broke at the attachment point with the fuselage. There was no fire. All occupants survived, but twelve suffered serious injuries.

Five persons were injured in the accident. Flight 8615 departed Toronto on May 9, 23:03 hours local time, on a domestic flight to Sudbury. Visibility at Sudbury was poor and the flight was not able to land. The flight crew elected to return to Toronto, where a normal landing was made at 01:25 hours local time (May 10). As the aircraft was taxiing to the gate, a collision occurred with a fuel truck. The aircraft spun and sustained serious damage to the left side of the flight deck. The left hand rear cargo door was pushed inward and the no.1 propeller also suffered damage. Findings as to causes and contributing factors: 1. The limited field of view to the right of the fuel tanker driverÂs cab caused by the front elevating service platform and its structural elements, along with the condensation on the windows, resulted in the driver being unable to see the aircraft in time to avoid the collision. 2. The captain had a clear field of view in the direction of the oncoming fuel tanker but the visibility was limited due to darkness, rain, and reflected light, and he did not see the oncoming tanker during the critical moments before the collision.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A19O0063 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: TSB A19O0063   Location  Images: photo (c) TSB Canada; Toronto-Pearson International Airport, ON (YYZ); May 2019 photo (c) TSB Canada; Toronto-Pearson International Airport, ON (YYZ); 10 May 2019 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates16-Jan-2025 18:28 ASN Updated The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The five occupants of the DHC-2 sustained fatal injuries. The DHC-3 pilot sustained minor injuries, nine passengers sustained serious injuries, and one passenger sustained fatal injuries.  The purpose of both flights was to transport passengers to Ketchikan from the Misty Fjords National Monument area in Alaska, USA. Both flights were converging on a scenic waterfall before returning to the Ketchikan Harbor Seaplane Base. At 12:17:15, the DHC-3 was about level at 4,000 ft mean sea level (msl) on a track of 225Â°, and the DHC-2 was 4.2 nautical miles south of the DHC-3, climbing through 2,800 ft msl, on a track of 255Â°. About 12:19, the DHC-3 started a descent from 4,000 ft msl, and the DHC-2 was at 3,175 ft msl and climbing. During the next 1 minute 21 seconds, the DHC-3 continued to descend on a track between 224Â° and 237Â°, and the DHC-2 leveled out at 3,350 ft msl on a track of about 255Â°. The airplanes collided at 12:21:14 at an altitude of 3,350 ft msl, 7.4 nm northeast of Ketchikan Harbor. The DHC-3 pilot stated to the NTSB that the flight from the Misty Fjords area had proceeded normally, and he had descended and was maneuvering the airplane to show passengers a waterfall near Mahoney Lake when the collision occurred. Just prior to the collision, he saw a flash from his left side, and experienced a large, loud impact. According to the pilot, the DHC-3 airplane then rolled right and pitched about 40 degrees nose down toward the water in George Inlet. The pilot stated that he was able to maintain some control and flare the airplane prior to impact. The pilot, some passengers, and some bystanders helped the passengers of the DHC-3 evacuate the airplane and move to the shore. The DHC-3 main wreckage came to rest about 80 ft underwater about 400 ft off the east shore of George Inlet. The DHC-2 airplane broke up in-flight after the collision, and the wreckage was scattered over water and mountainous tree-covered terrain northeast of Mahoney Lake on the west shore of George Inlet. Both aircraft were ADS-B-equipped and both pilots were presented with visual traffic information through the iPad with ForeFlight app (DHC-2) and Chelton display (DHC-3). However, the Garmin GSL 71 on the DHC-3 had been turned off, causing pressure altitude of the airplane not to be transmitted with the ADS-B data. Thus, both systems were not able to generate warnings of potential conflicts. Additionally, the DHC-2 was obscured from the Otter pilot's vision by the window frame until the very last moment. The Beaver pilot likely was unable to see the Otter approaching from behind due to the aircraft structure and the passenger seated on his right. Probable Cause: The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the inherent limitations of the see-and-avoid concept, which prevented the two pilots from seeing the other airplane before the collision, and the absence of visual and aural alerts from both airplanesÂ traffic display systems, while operating in a geographic area with a high concentration of air tour activity. Contributing to the accident were (1) the Federal Aviation AdministrationÂs provision of new transceivers that lacked alerting capability to Capstone Program operators without adequately mitigating the increased risk associated with the consequent loss of the previously available alerting capability and (2) the absence of a requirement for airborne traffic advisory systems with aural alerting among operators who carry passengers for hire.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: AAR-21-04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources: KTUU.com  KTVA.com  ADN.com  Coast Guard statement   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Ketchikan, AK; 13 May 2019; (publicdomain) photo (c) John Olafson; Ketchikan, AK; 02 July 2013 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane was owned and operated by the pilot as an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight when the accident occurred. The pilot and the sole passenger were fatally injured and the airplane was destroyed. The flight departed MQJ about 1243 destined for Minden-Tahoe Airport (MEV), Nevada. Radar data depicted the airplane departing from runway 7 at MQJ. Shortly after departure, the airplane began a left turn towards an air traffic control (ATC) assigned heading of 320Â°. After reaching an altitude of about 1,400 ft MSL, the airplane descended until it disappeared from the radar. A witness on the ground at MQJ reported seeing the airplane in an estimated 90Â° left bank with the nose parallel to the horizon shortly after departure. He observed the airplane's nose lower slightly before rising again to a level attitude. At no point did he observe the nose of the airplane rise above the horizon. The nose of the airplane again lowered and the airplane impacted the ground. The airplane impacted a flooded cornfield and exhibited significant fragmentation. The wreckage and debris field covered an area of about 270 ft long and 103 ft wide. The initial ground scar was aligned on about a 327Â° magnetic heading (MH). The nose of the airplane came to rest on a 268Â° MH and the tail came to rest on a 182Â° MH.

The aircraft came to rest in trees. The cause of the accident with the An-2 RA-68161 aircraft was a drop in engine power during takeoff, which led to the need for a forced landing immediately after the aircraft took off, as a result of which a rolling out of the runway occurred with a subsequent collision with the trees of the forest belt. The drop in engine power was due to the destruction of the exhaust manifold flame tubes, which led to a loss of engine power on takeoff due to the ingress of exhaust gases into the carburetor through an open choke. The destruction of fragments of the exhaust manifold flame tubes occurred as a result of overheating of the material during operation. Contributing factors are most likely to be: - shortcomings in the technical operation of the aircraft: flight operations over a long period of time without taking into account the engine operating time and without obtaining the Airworthiness Certificate (without carrying out the work necessary to obtain it); - lack of sufficient distance to safely end the takeoff.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: MAK  Russian Emergency Situations Ministry   Location  Images: photo (c) Ministry of Emergency Situations in the Stavropol Territory; Zhuravskoye; 22 May 2019 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot was not found and presumed fatally injured. According to the owner of the airplane, he purchased the airplane two days prior to the accident. The airplane had recently undergone a progressive inspection, which was completed on May 22, 2019. The owner then hired a contract pilot to fly the airplane to Fort Lauderdale-Executive Airport (FXE) to have some avionics work done.  The aircraft departed St. Louis Regional Airport, Illinois, USA at 18:36 UTC (13:36 local time) on the flight to FXE. The aircraft climbed to the cruising altitude of FL390.  The pilot established communications with the Atlanta Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) and reported he was level at FL390, and that the air was smooth. Later, the air traffic controller tried to communicate with the pilot to tell him to contact the Jacksonville ARTCC, but the controller was unable to make contact with the pilot. The controller made several attempts to contact the pilot on different radio frequencies, to no avail. The controller then advised Jacksonville ARTCC that communications with the flight had been lost. The Jacksonville controllers then continued to monitor the flight via radar. The flight transitioned through Jacksonville and Miami ARTCC airspace without any radio contact. The US Air Force dispatched two Homestead AFRES F-15 aircraft to intercept the accident airplane. One of the interceptor pilots reported that he could see the pilot unconscious and slumped over the controls. The intercept airplanes followed the accident airplane until it descended and impacted the Atlantic Ocean about 310 miles east of FXE.

Of the 128 passengers and crew onboard, one flight attendant sustained serious injuries and one flight attendant sustained minor injuries. The airplane was not damaged. The flight was operating under 14 CFR Part 121 as a regularly scheduled passenger flight from Chicago Midway International Airport (KMDW), Chicago, Illinois, to KJAX. According to the captain, as the flight approached 15,000 feet, he noticed there was a scattered layer of clouds they needed to descend through, and so he elected to provide the 10,000-foot chime to the flight attendants early. As the flight descended through the layer at about 12,000 feet, the airplane encountered moderate turbulence. The seat belt sign was off, and the flight crew had turned off the weather radar about 5 minutes before because they had observed no weather between the airplane and KJAX.  According to the flight attendants (FA), the turbulence was encountered shortly after they received the 10,000-foot chime and begun their final walkthrough of the cabin. The two FAs in the aft cabin were thrown into the air and then struck the floor. One of the injured FAs was transferred to a passenger seat for the remainder of the flight. The flight crew was notified of the injury, who requested that paramedics meet the airplane at the gate. After landing, the two aft FAs were transported to the hospital where one was diagnosed with a fractured ankle. Post accident examination of the weather data determined that the turbulence was encountered in the vicinity of the sea breeze front and localized convergence where towering cumulus clouds (cumulus congestus clouds) were depicted on the satellite imagery. There was no lightning detected, pilot reports (PIREPs), or inflight advisories for convection or turbulence current for the area.   Probable Cause: an encounter with convectively induced turbulence while penetrating cumulus clouds during descent.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA19CA151 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA19CA151  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

At 1842 UTC (0242 LT), at night, the aircraft commenced pushback from stand B1. The push back operation used a towing tractor with the three crew members consisting of a towing tractor driver, a wing-man and a headset-man, a task performed by an aircraft mechanic. There was no briefing among the crew related to the pushback activity including the push back maneuver. The towing tractor driver and wing-man used high visibility vest while the headset-man used company uniform without any fluorescence strip or high visibility vest. The push back maneuver did not follow the guideline and the headset-man walked behind the nose wheel while observing the engine start process. During a turn, the aircraft nose wheel passed over the right foot of the headset-man. The towing tractor driver felt a bump and noticed that the headset-man laid on the ground. The headset-man was evacuated to the nearest hospital for medical treatment and found to have sustainied a fracture on his right tarsometatarsal. Contributing factors of the occurrence: The different assumption of pushback maneuver between headset-man and the push back tractor driver, and both were fixated to their own duties while working on a reduced alertness condition, resulted in the towing tractor driver did not aware of the headset-man position and the headset-man did not aware of the nose wheel position. These conditions led to the nose wheel passed over the headset-man foot.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSC Report number: KNKT.19.05.10.04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSC Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates09-Apr-2023 14:07 harro Added Corrections or additions? ...
