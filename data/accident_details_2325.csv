There were no injuries to the passengers and crew onboard either airplane, and the Endeavor Air airplane received substantial damage. Endeavor Air flight 4994 was operating under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 as a regularly scheduled passenger flight, and ITA Airways flight 610 was operating under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 129 as a scheduled international passenger flight. Endeavor Air flight 4994 landed on runway 22L at JFK and proceeded on taxiway juliet, then to taxiway alpha, and then initiated a turn onto taxiway KF into the ramp area. The Endeavor Air flight crew reported being cleared to enter the Terminal 4 ramp and taxi to gate B44. Ramp control advised the flight crew to give way to traffic parking at gate B42 before parking at their assigned gate. The Endeavor Air flight crew moved forward onto taxiway KF, and the flight crew stated they pulled as far forward as they could into the ramp area but could not pull any further forward due to an airplane awaiting to park at another gate. The flight crew remained stationary and continued to monitor ground and ramp frequencies while waiting to park at their assigned gate. ITA Airways flight 610 landed on runway 22L and taxied to the ramp area using taxiway alpha. The flight crew reported they saw the Endeavor Air airplane turning onto taxiway KF and recalled the Endeavor Air airplane stopping as soon as it entered the taxiway. As ITA Airways proceeded on taxiway alpha, the captain, who was the pilot monitoring, noticed the tail of the Endeavor Air airplane was close to taxiway alpha and reduced ground speed. The ITA Airways flight crew stated they presumed they were clear of the Endeavor Air airplane since their airplane was taxiing on the centerline of taxiway alpha. The Endeavor Air flight crew reported feeling a severe shaking which prompted them to look out of the left side of the airplane where they observed that the ITA Airways airplane was missing its right winglet. This prompted the Endeavor Air flight crew to conclude their airplane may have been struck by ITA Airways airplane and they instructed air traffic control (ATC) that their airplane needed to remain stationary until the damages were confirmed and an exterior check could be performed.  ITA Airways flight 610 proceeded to their gate. Post accident inspection revealed substantial damage to the right elevator and horizontal stabilizer structure of Endeavor Airâs airplane, and minor damage to the right winglet of ITA Airwaysâ airplane.

The passengers had disembarked from the aircraft but the crew were still on board. One of the vehicles from the ground handling company reversed towards the aircraft, in order to empty the aircraftâs toilet tank. During the reversing manoeuvre, the driver stopped after hearing a series of unusual beeps. After consulting with his employer, the driver carefully continued reversing. During this manoeuvre, the platform on the back of the vehicle started to rise, of its own accord. As a consequence, a section of the railing around the platform punched a hole in the fuselage of the aircraft. The platform can only be operated from outside the vehicle.  Besides the driver, who was sat in the cab, no one was in the vicinity of the vehicle. Following a technical investigation of the vehicle and the platform by the ground handling company, together with the manufacturer, no cause was discovered for the spontaneous rising of the platform.  The Dutch Safety Board has not further investigated this occurrence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Dutch Safety Board Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: OVV  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates01-Jun-2023 17:57 harro Added Corrections or additions? ...

A little bit earlier at 06:18 LT, an international phone call in English from Germany to the Narita International Airport Information Center told about a threat with 100 kg of plastic bomb in the cargo hold of GK501.   The flight crew of GK501 was informed the threat at 07:18 LT, while flying over about 65 km north of Chubu at FL380, and decided to divert to Chubu Centrair.  No emergency were declared by the flight crew, however, the ATC provided some priority to the flight.  The Airbus made a safe landing on the runway 36 of Centrair at 07:41 LT.  At 07:44 LT, emergency evacuation using slides was carried out on the taxiway A just south of vacating from A3.  Five passengers received minor injuries of scratch during the evacuation.   The sole runway was closed until 12:15 LT.  63 commercial flights were canceled, more delays and diversions happened.   No explosive device was found by a search after the evacuation.   On 10th February, JCAB rated this occurrence as an accident since it was revealed that one of the five injured passengers had suffered a serious injury of sacral fracture by evacuation.  JTSB launched an investigation.

The captain decided to head to the alternate, Varandey Airport.  The aircraft climbed to an altitude of 200 m, but the aircraft was only able to maintain that altitude using takeoff power. The captain then decided to perform a forced landing. By then the windows had frozen up because the window heating did not work. The aircraft descended until it struck the ground. Conclusion The aviation accident involving the An-2 aircraft RA-71165 occurred during a forced landing, which was necessitated by the inability to continue the flight due to the impact of icing on the aircraft's aerodynamic and thrust characteristics.  Contributing factors included: - The captain's failure to consider potential risks of the aircraft encountering icing conditions when making the decision to take off; - The captain's delayed decision to change the flight plan despite receiving information about deteriorating meteorological conditions at the destination, which fell below the established thresholds for VFR (Visual Flight Rules) night flights and indicated the possibility of aircraft icing; - Non-compliance with VFR rules regarding prolonged flight in actual icing conditions.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: vk.com/okrugnao  nao24.ru   Location  Images: photo (c) MAK; Karatayka; January 2023 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates15-Jul-2024 13:38 ASN Updated [Narrative, Accident report, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The crew performed a visual approach and subsequently landed on runway 10. Reversers were deployed and brakes were applied.  At the end of the rollout the aircraft made a sharp left turn, causing it to veer off the runway and roll downhill. The sudden yaw occurred as the pilot stowed the reversers. Both pilots used the brakes but were not able to counter the yaw. Subsequently, the captain attempted to extend the reversers again, but they did not deploy. At that moment, a lateral excursion to the left side of the runway occurred, resulting in the aircraft moving outside the North safety area of Runway 10-28 and descending into the vegetation zone.

The aircraft crashed on the bank of Seti River and partially ended up in a deep gorge, killing all 72 on board.  The flight was operated by two captains, one captain was in the process of obtaining aerodrome familiarization for operating into Pokhara and the other captain being the instructor pilot. The captain being familiarized, who was occupying the left hand seat, was the Pilot Flying (PF) and the instructor pilot, occupying the right hand seat, was the Pilot Monitoring (PM). They had operated two sectors between Kathmandu and Pokhara earlier in the morning. The take-off, climb, cruise and descent to Pokhara was normal. During the first contact with Pokhara tower the Air Traffic Controller (ATC) assigned the runway 30 to land. At a later time, the flight crew requested and received clearance from ATC to land on runway 12. At 10:51:36, the aircraft descended from 6,500 feet and joined the downwind track for runway 12 to the north of the runway. The aircraft was visually identified by ATC during the approach. At 10:56:12, the pilots extended the flaps to the 15 degrees position and selected the landing gears lever to the down position. The take-off (TO) setting was selected on power management panel. At 10:56:27, the PF disengaged the Autopilot System (AP) at an altitude of 721 feet Above Ground Level (AGL). The PF then called for ""FLAPS 30"" at 10:56:32, and the PM replied, ""Flaps 30 and descending"". The flight data recorder (FDR) data did not record any flap movement at that time. Instead, the propeller rotation speed (Np) of both engines decreased simultaneously to less than 25% and the torque (Tq) started decreasing to 0%, which is consistent with both propellers going into the feathered condition. This was followed by a single Master Caution chime.  The flight crew then carried out the ""Before Landing Checklist"" before starting the left turn onto the base leg. During that time, the power lever angle increased from 41% to 44%. At the point, Np of both propellers were recorded as Non-Computed Data (NCD) in the FDR and the torque (Tq) of both engines were at 0%.  At 10:56:50 when the radio altitude callout for five hundred feet was annunciated, another 'click' sound was heard, likely the crew had inhibited the master caution light. The aircraft reached a maximum bank angle of 30 degrees at this altitude. The yaw damper disconnected four seconds later. The PF consulted the PM on whether to continue the left turn and the PM replied to continue the turn. Subsequently, the PF asked the PM on whether to continue descend and the PM responded it was not necessary and instructed to apply a little power. At 10:56:54, another click was heard, followed by the flaps surface movement to the 30 degrees position. When ATC gave the clearance for landing at 10:57:07, the PF mentioned twice that there was no power coming from the engines. At 10:57:11, the power levers were advanced first to 62 degrees then to the maximum power position. It was followed by a 'click' sound at 10:57:16. One second afterwards, the aircraft was at the initiation of its last turn at 368 feet AGL, the high-pressure turbine speed (Nh) of both engines increased from 73% to 77%. At 10:57:18 the PF handed over control of the aircraft to the PM and the PM (who was previously the PF) repeated again that there was no power from the engines. At 10:57:24 when the aircraft was at 311 feet AGL, the stick shaker was activated. At 10:57:26, a second sequence of stick shaker warning was activated when the aircraft banked towards the left abruptly. Thereafter, the radio altitude alert for two hundred feet was annunciated, and the cricket sound and stick shaker ceased. At 10:57:32, the aircraft impacted the ground.  The Pokhara International Airport was opened on January 1, 2023 and is located to the east-southeast of the old Pokhara Airport. The most probable cause of the accident is determined to be the inadvertent movement of both condition levers to the feathered position in flight, which resulted in feathering of both propellers and subsequent loss of thrust, leading to an aerodynamic stall and collision with terrain. The contributing factors to the accident are: 1 High workload due to operating into a new airport with surrounding terrain and the crew missing the associated flight deck and engine indications that both propellers had been feathered. 2 Human factor issues such as high workload and stress that appears to have resulted in the misidentification and selection of the propellers to the feathered position. 3 The proximity of terrain requiring a tight circuit to land on runway 12. This tight circuit was not the usual visual circuit pattern and contributed to the high workload. This tight pattern also meant that the approach did not meet the stabilised visual approach criteria. 4 Use of visual approach circuit for RWY 12 without any evaluation, validation and resolution of its threats which were highlighted by the SRM team of CAAN and advices proposed in flight procedures design report conducted by the consultant and without the development and approval of the chart by the operator and regulator respectively. 5 Lack of appropriate technical and skill based training (including simulator) to the crew and proper classroom briefings (for that flight) for the safe operation of flight at new airport for visual approach to runway 12. 6 Non-compliance with SOPs, ineffective CRM and lack of sterile cockpit discipline.METAR: 04:30 UTC / 10:15 local time: VNPR METAR 0430Z 17003KT 070V190 6000 FEW025 14/09 Q1016 NOSIG05:00 UTC / 10:45 local time: VNPR METAR 0500Z 12005KT 080V160 6000 FEW025 14/09 Q1015 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: Nepal AAIC Report number: prelim.report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: kathmandupost.com History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  17 June 2016 HS-DRD Nok Air 0 near Chumphon min Windscreen cracks or failure Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates28-Dec-2023 15:21 harro Updated [Other fatalities, Damage, Narrative, Accident report, ]13-Dec-2024 15:45 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The Boeing faced sideways and made a contact with a parked main deck loader, causing a 15 cm hole in the fuselage skin between the radome and a nose landing gear door.  No personal injuries were reported.  JTSB launched an investigation as an accident.   The airport was partially covered with ice and was blown by strong gust of winds at the time of the accident.   Probable Cause: The JTSB concludes that it is certain that the probable cause of this accident was that while turning toward the Spot, the aircraft slid on the icy surface on the Spot and the PIC became unable to control the taxiing of the aircraft, thus the aircraft collided with a ground service equipment parking around the Spot, resulting in damage to the airframe. The aircraft slid on the icy surface probably because the surface conditions on the Spot had not been fully improved for the taxing of the aircraft, and its taxiing speed was not the one to cope with the surface conditions on the Spot. The surface conditions on the Spot had not been fully improved because the spray range and amount of the anti-icing agents were inappropriate, which probably contributed to it. In addition, the aircraftâs taxiing speed was not the one to cope with the surface conditions on the Spot probably because the information that would affect the taxiing of aircraft was not provided to the flight crewmembers of the aircraft from the ground.METAR: METAR (accident time 24/2245Z):  RJAA 242230Z 28015G25KT 250V320 9999 FEW030 M03/M18 Q1012 NOSIG RMK 1CU030 A2991= RJAA 242330Z 29015KT 250V310 9999 FEW030 M02/M18 Q1013 TEMPO 29020G32KT RMK 1CU030 A2994=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JTSB Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: https://www.yomiuri.co.jp/national/20230125-OYT1T50093/  https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20230125/k10013959941000.html  https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/652983b31ac5615358f6d0831edb9b207527e746  https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/652983b31ac5615358f6d0831edb9b207527e746  https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/4602eb16ea69dca94884384659cd9cbf3e7fc139  https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/5fdba98f1f97695d4e44d49352cbf648d106141b  https://jtsb.mlit.go.jp/jtsb/aircraft/detail2.php?id=2347  https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/ja603a#2ef54a57 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates11-Feb-2025 15:35 ASN Updated [Narrative, Accident report, ] Corrections or additions? ...

Pearson Intl. (CYYZ), ON to Fort Lauderdale Exec Airport (KFXE), FL.  At approximately 12:11, while the aircraft was in climb over Cayuga, Ontario, at an altitude of approximately 23000 feet above sea level (ASL), the whole upper cowl door and most of the lower cowl door on the left engine partially detached from the nacelle, before becoming completely detached, resulting in a sudden increase in parasite drag on the left side of the aircraft. The aircraft suddenly yawed and rolled to the left, and the flight crew then lost control of the aircraft as it rapidly lost altitude. The flight crew subsequently declared an emergency by transmitting a Mayday call, and at approximately 3200 feet ASL, they regained control of the aircraft and stopped the descent. The flight crew requested a diversion to Buffalo Niagara International Airport (KBUF), New York, U.S. They subsequently burned off some of the aircraftâs fuel and followed air traffic control (ATC) guidance. Although the aircraft remained difficult to control, the crew landed on Runway 23 at KBUF at approximately 12:41, with aircraft rescue and firefighting (ARFF) emergency vehicles standing by. While the aircraft was taxiing to the ramp, a remaining portion of the lower cowl door fell off the horizontal stabilizer onto the taxiway. After the aircraft came to a stop on the apron, ARFF informed the flight crew that the remaining portion of the cowl had detached from the aircraft. In the days before the accident maintenance work was carried out at the companyâs maintenance hangar. The work performed addressed 2 reported defects, requiring the removal and reinstallation of the lower cowl doors on both the left and right engines. The accident flight was the first flight after maintenance. Findings as to causes and contributing factors 1.   During the reinstallation of the lower cowl doors, the non-sequential order in which the fasteners were tightened likely led to a slip of attention that combined with an unclear expectation on the part of both aircraft maintenance engineers about who would be securing the remaining fasteners. As a result, 6 consecutive fasteners were left unsecured. 2. The reinstallation of the left-engine cowl doors and the daily inspection were conducted and certified during the same shift and by the same aircraft maintenance engineer. Given that the cowl door reinstallation was completed as part of the maintenance work at the very end of the work shift, the daily inspection item for checking the condition and security of the engine cowl doors was not performed as a specific, separate operation. As a result, the improperly secured condition of the cowl door went unnoticed. 3. The location of the unsecured fasteners on the cowl door is not easily visible and was not typically checked during pre-flight walkarounds, and no specific guidance on how to look for unsecured fasteners on this aircraft was available to company flight crews. As a result, the unsecured fasteners went undetected by the flight crew despite their multiple walkaround inspections before the occurrence flight. 4. Because some of the fasteners were not secured, there was likely a gap between the cowl door and the nacelle that allowed air to flow inside the nacelle. The cowl doors then partially detached from the nacelle, resulting in the loss of control and rapid descent. Following this, a portion of cowl door became lodged on the horizontal stabilizer and resulted in continued difficulty to control the aircraft.

The first officer was Pilot Flying on this leg. The CVR recordings indicated that the First Officerâs knowledge of the destination aerodrome and understanding of the published instrument procedure RNAV RWY 07 at MYEH was inadequate. Furthermore, the First Officer was engaged in nonessential conversation during critical phase of flight.

Both occupants survived the crash. The aircraft was consumed by fire.  The aircraft had been contracted by the Australian National Aerial Firefighting Centre (NAFC) and was flown to Australia in December 2022. == Contributing factors â¢ During the retardant drop downhill, the aircraft descended significantly below the operatorâs standard target drop height and airspeed and entered a high rate of descent with the engines at idle. While the engines were starting to accelerate at completion of the drop, the airspeed and thrust were insufficient to climb above a ridgeline in the exit path, which resulted in the collision with terrain. â¢ Prior to the retardant drop, the aircraft captain (pilot flying) did not detect there was rising terrain in the exit from the drop, which likely contributed to the captain allowing the aircraft to enter a low energy state during the drop. â¢ After arrival at the fireground, the aircraft captain (pilot flying) declined a âShow-Meâ run and was briefed by the Birddog pilot that it would be a downhill drop. Bomber 139 then conducted a go-around from the high ground after the first drop and was led to the target through the smoke on the second drop. These factors likely contributed to the captain not expecting or detecting the rising terrain in the exit path. â¢ The co-pilot (pilot monitoring) did not identify and announce any deviations during the retardant drop, which could have alerted the aircraft captain (pilot flying) to the low-energy state of the aircraft when it descended below the target drop height with the engines at idle. â¢ The flight crew did not brief a target retardant drop height and, contrary to published standard operating procedures, did not set it as a decision height reference on the radio altimeter. Subsequently, the co-pilot (pilot monitoring), who did not believe there was a minimum drop height, did not alert the aircraft captain (pilot flying) to the low-energy state of the aircraft.  â¢ Coulson Aviation and the relevant Western Australian Government Departments had not published a minimum retardant drop height in their respective operating procedures for large air tankers. Consequently, the co-pilot (pilot monitoring), who did not believe there was a minimum drop height, did not alert the aircraft captain (pilot flying) to a drop height deviation prior to the collision. (Safety issue) Other factors that increased risk â¢ The Coulson Aviation practice of recalculating the target retardant drop speed after a partial drop reduced the post-drop stall speed and energy-height safety margins. (Safety issue) â¢ The Coulson Aviation crew resource management practice of limiting the pilot monitoring (PM) announcements to deviations outside the target retardant drop parameter tolerances increased the risk of the aircraft entering an unrecoverable state before the PM would alert the pilot flying. (Safety issue) â¢ Australian states and territories that engage in Large Air Tanker (LAT) operations have developed their own separate standard operating procedures (SOPs) for LATs and aerial supervision assets. This can result in safety requirements being omitted or misunderstood by the different tasking agencies, such as a minimum drop height, resulting in inconsistencies in the development and application of LAT SOPs.

Kennedy International Airport, NY (JFK/KJFK)"," AAIB","Accident investigation report completed and information captured","Delta Air Lines flight DL209, a Boeing 767-332ER, suffered a contained engine failure (PW4060) on takeoff from Edinburgh Airport (EDI) and experienced airframe vibration and engine indications resulting in the aircraft diverting to Prestwick Airport. Once on stand, fuel was seen coming from the right wing and the passengers were rapidly disembarked. Conclusion During the early stages of the event flight a high-pressure turbine blade fractured through fatigue cracking. The fatigue crack was initiated by a possible combination of hot corrosion and pitting from external contamination. The detached blade caused damage to a further five blades resulting in an engine imbalance. A drain tube in the right fuel tank fractured, probably as a result of the vibrations transmitted from the out of balance engine. This resulted in fuel escaping from the right fuel tank out of a wing drain hole and igniting in flight. The flight crew landed the aircraft promptly at Prestwick. They were unaware of any flames, or the right engine running down, until after landing. The fuel coming from the wing was noticed by the ground crew as the aircraft parked near the terminal buildings. The wind was blowing the fuel towards the hot brakes and there was a risk of a fuel fire. The passengers were rapidly disembarked, and actions were taken to contain and stop the fuel leak. As a result of the vibration-driven fatigue fracture of the drain tube, the aircraft manufacturer has launched a project to identify potential reliability improvements to the design while the Federal Aviation Administration reviews the manufacturerâs finding that the risk of a catastrophic outcome from a failed drain tube is not elevated.  Note: this occurrence was initially rated an Accident by the AAIB and later downgraded to a Serious Incident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: AAIB-28968 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/anniversary-statement-boeing-767-332er-n197dn  https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scots-delta-flight-passengers-tears-29184507  https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/10204858/delta-airlines-abandoned-passengers-edinburgh-plane-catches-fire/  https://registry.faa.gov/AircraftInquiry/Search/NNumberResult?nNumberTxt=197DN  https://globe.adsbexchange.com/?icao=a18284&lat=55.775&lon=-3.981&zoom=10.0&showTrace=2023-02-10&leg=3  https://flightaware.com/live/flight/N197DN/history/20230210/1100Z/EGPH/EGPK  https://www.flightradar24.com/data/flights/dl209#2f25c80d  https://www.planespotters.net/photo/1242509/n197dn-delta-air-lines-boeing-767-332erwl (photo)  Media:A Report has been published into a serious incident involving a Boeing 767-332(ER), N197DN, contained engine failure leading to a fuel leak, Prestwick Airport, 10 February 2023https://t.co/M9N8WpOPAB#AviationSafety #Aviation pic.twitter.com/SYs19JluNd— AAIB (@aaibgovuk) July 18, 2024 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates14-Feb-2024 18:08 ASN Updated [Location, Source, Damage, Narrative, ]18-Jul-2024 11:38 ASN Updated [Damage, Narrative, Accident report, ]18-Jul-2024 11:41 ASN Updated [Embed code, ] Corrections or additions? ...

There were no injuries reported. The pilot stated to PNG AIC investigators that before entering the final approach, he extended full flap and maintained a speed of about 90 knots. The wind within the circuit area was calm. During the final approach, he started feeling wind gusts against the aircraft. The pilot stated that at that stage, he had passed the committal point. He therefore continued to land.  The pilot stated that immediately after touchdown, the aircraft became airborne. The aircraft settled back onto the ground again. As the aircraft continued its roll, the aircraft became airborne again. Shortly after settling onto the ground the second time, the aircraft rolled off the end of the airstrip. The aircraft subsequently impacted the embankment of a drain which runs along the edge of the airstrip. The aircraft came to rest upon impact. The pilot subsequently shut down the engine instructed the passengers to follow him out of the left cockpit door. Causes [Contributing factors]: â¢ The flight to Eliptamin from Kiunga Airport was outside the operational times recommended in the companyâs Operations Manual. â¢ The aircraft was overhead the airstrip at a height of about 3,000 ft AGL, which was higher compared to the pilotâs previous flights to Eliptamin where the altitude did not exceed 1,700 ft AGL when overhead the airstrip. â¢ The AIC believes that the overhead inspection was conducted at a far too high altitude to properly assess the surface condition of the airstrip and the wind behaviour. â¢ Excessive groundspeed on approach and touchdown due to the tailwind was attributed to the localised weather present at Eliptamin Airstrip. â¢ The pilot could not identify that there were strong winds present at Eliptamin Airstrip. â¢ The pilot lacked awareness of the windsock located at the approach end of runway 14, and the windsock located at the departure end of the runway near the parking bay, did not give the appropriate indication of the prevailing winds at Eliptamin Airstrip. â¢ The tailwind component that was experienced on final approach and touchdown was beyond the allowable limit of 10 kts as stated in the Operatorâs Manual and the Aircraft Flight Manual. â¢ The aircraft landed with excess speed which caused the aircraft to bounce off the ground upon touchdown on the threshold. The aircraft was then pushed up strip by the prevailing airstrip wind conditions, while in the air. The pilot attempted to control the aircraft and managed to get the aircraft back onto the ground, however, the aircraft bounced off the ground once more and travelled further up strip while in the air. The pilot finally got the aircraft back onto the ground, however, at that point, there was no sufficient runway available to bring the aircraft to a stop. â¢ While in the air both times following the touchdown at the threshold, the aircraft was pushed further down the runway and eventually ran out of runway length and impacted the embankment at the end of the runway. â¢ On-site investigation team observed from the amount of mud deposits on the aircraftâs wheels and airframe that the strip surface was not completely dry at the time of the accident and may have had a negative impact on the braking capacity of the aircraft during the landing roll.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIC PNG Report number: AIC 23-1002 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources: PNG AIC History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  17 October 2022 P2-HFA Helifix - PNG 0 AYKI - Kiunga non Tire failure Location  Images: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates14-Feb-2024 08:04 ASN Updated [Narrative, Accident report, Photo, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight was a regularly scheduled passenger flight from Orlando International Airport (MCO), Orlando, Florida to ORD. As a result of the turbulence, one flight attendant (FA) sustained serious injuries. The aircraft was not damaged, and the flight landed without further incident.  The flight crew reported that while on the VEECK5 arrival at flight level (FL)290, near the top of the decent, air traffic control (ATC) advised of reports of moderate turbulence between FL240 and FL190. ATC suggested the flight begin its decent early to avoid the area, and the flight crew agreed. The flight had previously been smooth, and this was the first turbulence advisory they had received from ATC.  The captain informed the cabin crew to expect moderate turbulence in about 10 minutes and advised them to prepare the cabin for landing and take their seats. The captain made an announcement for the passengers to remain seated. The seatbelt sign was on. While the cabin crew was preparing for landing, the airplane encountered severe turbulence as it descended through FL250.  FA1 reached the forward jumpseat, while FA2 and FA3 reached nearby cabin seats. All 3 had difficulty reaching their seats and trouble securing their seatbelts due to the turbulence.  FA4 was lifted up then down to the floor while attempting to reach a seat, injuring her left leg and ankle. She remained on the aisle floor until the turbulence ended, about 2 minutes after it began.  Once FA1 confirmed it was safe to get up, she informed the captain about the injury to FA4 and went to check on the passengers with FA2. FA3 tended to FA4 and made a passenger announcement requesting medical assistance. A nurse who was a passenger on board rendered aid to FA4. The captain advised dispatch of the event and requested medical personnel meet the airplane at the gate. After landing, FA4 was transported to the hospital where she was diagnosed with multiple fractures to her left leg and ankle which required surgery.  A post-accident weather analysis provided by the operator showed strong horizontal and vertical wind shear and gravity waves in the area indicating an environment conducive to clear air turbulence. Preflight weather planning predicted light to moderate turbulence between FL290 to FL360 in the area of the event. While there were no active Significant Meteorological hazards (SIGMETs) over the area of the event, a turbulence SIGMET was in effect between FL290 and FL360 for an area about 20 nautical miles southeast of the event. The Turbulence Auto-PIREP System (TAPS) had generated severe turbulence reports for altitudes between FL276 and FL244 in the hour prior to the event, and one pilot report of severe turbulence between FL200 and FL250 was issued a few minutes after the event. Probable Cause: An encounter with clear air turbulence during descent.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA23LA170 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA23LA170 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  2 September 2008 N944AN American Airlines 0 Los Angeles International Airport, CA (LAX/KLAX) non Tire failure Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates04-Apr-2024 08:04 ASN Update Bot Added 04-Apr-2024 08:52 ASN Updated [Aircraft type, Nature, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

Neither pilot reported identifying any mechanical issues with the airplane before the flight. The flight was uneventful and both pilots described the landing as being firm, with the copilot stating the landing was in the touchdown zone on the runway. The pilot reported that after landing he knew something was wrong because the left wing was low. The pilots taxied the airplane to the ramp where they discovered fuel leaking from the left wing.  A review of airport surveillance video revealed that the airplane touched down around the displaced threshold, bounced, and touched down again. Examination of the runway revealed skid marks beginning in the displaced threshold about 110 ft before the landing surface of the runway. Fractured airplane parts were scattered over and beyond the ground scars and tire markings. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed it sustained structural and skin damage to the left wing, the landing gear strut, and both left main wheels.  One passenger said that she heard altitudes called out during the landing approach, and just before touchdown, she heard a crewmember announce, âtoo fast, too fast!' She stated the airplane contacted the runway so hard the oxygen masks deployed and compartments inside the airplane opened. The airplane bounced, and the second landing was bumpy. She also stated that fuel was leaking from the airplane when they were deplaned. Although the pilots' subsequent statements indicated that they observed that the airplane's left wing was âlower' during takeoff on the accident flight, surveillance video of the airplane from the departure airport did not indicate any anomalies. Given the available evidence, it is likely that the pilots failed to attain a proper landing flare and touchdown point, which resulted in a hard landing short of the runway. Probable Cause: The pilots' failure to attain a proper landing flare and touchdown point, which resulted in a hard landing short of the runway.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA23LA126 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB ERA23LA126  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates27-Oct-2024 20:48 ASN Update Bot Updated [Time, Operator, Other fatalities, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, ]27-Oct-2024 20:58 ASN Updated [Operator, Other fatalities, Departure airport, Destination airport, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

As a result of the turbulence, all three flight attendants were injured with two receiving minor injuries and one receiving a serious injury. The aircraft continued to its destination without further incident.  According to the captain, the flight crew completed the approach checklist and illuminated the seat belt sign when the airplane was at about flight level (FL)180. As the airplane passed through 12,000 feet, the first officer (FO) made an announcement to the flight attendants to prepare the cabin for landing.  According to the lead flight attendant, she made the landing announcement to passengers while the other two flight attendants started final checks from the aft cabin. The lead flight attendant then started the final check from the front of the aircraft. When the lead flight attendant was between rows 6 and 9, the airplane descended through a cloud layer at about 7000 feet and experienced what was described as moderate turbulence by the flight crew. This turbulence led to all three flight attendants falling to the floor. All three flight attendants agreed they needed medical attention and notified the flight crew. The FO called operations and requested for paramedics to meet the airplane. The flight continued to its destination without further incident. Upon arrival at MSY, paramedics met the airplane at the gate, and all flight attendants received medical treatment.  The lead flight attendant was transported to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a fractured ankle. Another flight attendant suffered minor injuries to their back and the third suffered minor injuries to their head. Both pilots stated that the cloud layer appeared stable with no vertical development, and there were no indications on the radar that suggested the risk of turbulence. A post-accident review of the weather conditions showed no pilot reports (PIREPs) for turbulence located within a 100 nm radius from the accident location within 2 hours of the accident time. There were no airman's meteorological information (AIRMETs), significant meteorological information (SIGMETs), or Center Weather Advisories for turbulence or thunderstorm activity for the accident location. Based on weather satellite information and upper air sounding data, the flight encountered convective activity while traversing building cumulus clouds during the descent.

Upon touchdown, he established the aileron controls for the crosswind and applied the brakes; however, no braking action was observed. The airplane subsequently drifted left and departed the runway pavement. It came to rest upright in the grass infield area adjacent to the runway. The outboard portion of the right wing separated which resulted in substantial damage.   Data indicated that the airplane was 14 knots or more above the published landing reference speed when it crossed the runway threshold, and it touched down about 2,000 ft from the threshold. The left and right weight-on-wheels (WOW) parameters transitioned from air to ground consistent with initial touchdown; however, the left WOW parameter transitioned back to air about 2 seconds later. The right WOW parameter remained on ground until the airplane departed the runway pavement. The brake system touchdown protection is designed to prevent brake application until wheel spin-up occurs to avoid the possibility of inadvertently landing with a locked wheel due to brake application. After weight-on-wheels has been true for three seconds, power braking is enabled. It is likely that the lack of positive weight-on-wheel parameters inhibited brake application due to the touchdown protection function and resulted in the pilot not observing any braking action. The excess airspeed, extended touchdown, and transient weight-on-wheels parameters were consistent with the airplane floating during the landing flare and with the application of aileron controls for the crosswind conditions. The airplane was not equipped with wing-mounted speed brakes which would have assisted in maintaining weight-on-wheels during the initial portion of the landing. The most recent wind report, transmitted by the tower controller when the airplane was on a 3-mile final, presented a 70Â° crosswind at 15 knots, gusting to 25 knots. The corresponding crosswind gust component was about 24 knots. The airplane flight manual specified a crosswind limitation of 20 kts for takeoff and landing; therefore, the crosswind at the time of the accident exceeded the airframe crosswind limitation and would have made control during touchdown difficult.  The pilot reported that he had made two requests with the approach controller to land on a different runway, but those requests were denied. The investigation was unable to make any determination regarding a pilot request for an alternate runway. Federal Aviation Regulations stated that the pilot in command of an aircraft is directly responsible for, and is the final authority as to, the operation of that aircraft. The regulations also stated that no person may operate a civil aircraft without complying with the operating limitations. The pilot's ultimate acceptance of the runway assignment which likely exceeded the crosswind limitation of the airplane was contrary to the regulations and to the safe operation of the airplane. Probable Cause: The pilot's loss of directional control during landing which resulted in a runway excursion. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's decision to land with a crosswind that exceeded the limitation for the airplane.METAR: 16:53 UTC / 10:53 local time: KHOU 171653Z 35017G26KT 10SM BKN250 07/M04 A3047 RMK AO2 PK WND 36026/1652 SLP324 T0067104417:53 UTC / 11:53 local time: KHOU 171753Z 34017G25KT 10SM BKN250 09/M04 A3045 RMK AO2 PK WND 31026/1737 SLP315 T00891044 10089 20033 58003Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN23LA112 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources: khou.com  flightaware.com   Location  Images: Photo: FAA Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates04-Apr-2024 08:25 ASN Updated [Narrative, Accident report, ]04-Apr-2024 08:26 ASN Updated [Photo, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Approaching 10,000 ft AMSL on descent into POM, the crew actioned the Fokker 70 Normal Procedures Before Approach Check. The flight crew subsequently noticed that the Landing Elevation Setting had not been set for an arrival into POM but was instead, still maintained at about 5,500 ft, which they initially set for HGU. The crew stated to the PNG AIC that since there was a need to increase the rate of pressurizing the cabin on descent, the Fokker 70 Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) Abnormal Procedures for Manual Cabin Pressurization Control Procedure was executed, and they continued with the approach for landing at POM via the ILS procedure for runway 14L. Once the aircraft was established on final approach for runway 14L, the cabin pressure differential indicated about 6 PSI. Seeing that the indication was above the maximum allowable cabin differential for landing (0.13 PSI), the crew terminated the approach and initiated a Go Around at about 16:00, from 1,000 ft AGL straight ahead over runway 14L. The aircraft climbed on runway heading to 2,500 ft AGL and requested clearance from ATC to conduct a right hand turn to track and visually hold at 2,500 ft. ATC provided the clearance as requested by the crew. The crew reportedly actioned the QRH Abnormal Procedure for ""Reduced Cabin Pressure Differential Procedure"". The aircraft then left the hold and with ATC clearance, tracked for a right base turn at about 16:14. The crew reportedly conducted a normal approach and landed on runway 14L at 16:20.  On  disembarking  the  aircraft , a passenger of the occurrence flight alerted Air Niugini Customer Service that a few passengers from the flight were bleeding from the ears and nose. It was reported that a total of 22 persons were injured; 4 persons had serious injuries and were admitted. PNG AIC rated the occurrence a 'Serious Incident'. However, per ICAO Annex 13, this occurrence should be considered an 'Accident', given the fact that four occupants had suffered serious injuries. CAUSES [CONTRIBUTING FACTORS] There were several factors that contributed to the serious incident. Flight crew actions were influenced by the organisational, operational and environmental conditions. â¢ Organisational factors like multiple changes to flight crew roster and last-minute notification to crew resulted in task saturation and stress, that prevented crew situational awareness and good crew resource management and decision making on the day of the serious incident. This resulted in the oversight by the crew to set Port Moresby landing altitude in Mt. Hagen. â¢ Operational and environmental conditions impacted the way crew conducted their operation in Mt. Hagen and in Port Moresby. â¢ The flight crew did not complete the final step of the Fokker 70 Abnormal Procedures Manual Cabin Pressurisation Control, which was to set the Manual control lever to the âUPâ position before landing to depressurise the cabin and prevent any further pressurisation. Due to not completing the procedure, the cabin differential began to increase again on finals which led to a go-around. Some passengers and cabin crew sustained injuries during the go-around due to a rapid change in cabin pressure. The flight crew then actioned the Fokker 70 Abnormal Procedures for Reduced Cabin Differential.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIC PNG Report number: AIC 23-2001 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: AIC PNG Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates12-Sep-2024 06:55 ASN Updated [Narrative, Accident report, ]12-Sep-2024 06:59 ASN Updated [Source, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The occurrence pilot, who had recently been promoted to pilot-in-command (PIC) on the Cessna 208B aircraft, was scheduled to fly alone in daytime visual flight rules (VFR) conditions. After reviewing the weather information with his colleagues at their morning briefing, he assessed that the weather was satisfactory for the flight and noted that the winds were forecast to be gusty. A pilot who was present at the briefing but was not scheduled for flight duty that day offered to accompany him. For all flights that day, the occurrence pilot would be the PIC and occupy the left seat, and the 2nd pilot went along as an extra crew member without any assigned duties, occupying the right seat. The cargo was loaded onto the aircraft, and the 1st flight of the day departed CYQN at 10:20 and landed in CYFH at 10:55. After unloading the cargo, they departed CYFH at 11:20 and returned to CYQN at 11:56. The pilots loaded the aircraft with cargo for their second flight to CYFH. According to the load sheet, there were 3320 pounds of groceries and household goods on board. The pilots refuelled the aircraft and departed from Runway 27 at approximately 12:45. A few minutes after departure, it was reported that they made a radio call on the aerodrome traffic frequency, indicating their location and an estimated time of arrival at CYFH of 13:30. Approximately 30 minutes after the occurrence flight departed, a second Cessna 208B aircraft departed also from CYQN to CYFH, with cargo for a different customer. The flight crew encountered snow showers en route, and shortly after they arrived at CYFH at 14:00, there was a snow squall, which significantly reduced visibility. At that time, 2 customers were waiting at CYFH for their cargo, and it soon became apparent that the occurrence aircraft had not yet arrived. At approximately 14:30, WNA personnel at CYQN were informed that the occurrence aircraft had not arrived at 13:30 as expected. At 14:45, management at WNA notified the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre (JRCC), in Trenton, Ontario, that the aircraft was overdue. WNA began its own aerial search along the flight path using C-FUYC, which departed CYFH at 15:10 with 2 crew members on board, flew along the direct route of flight of the missing aircraft, and returned to CYQN at 15:46. They refuelled the aircraft and departed on another search flight at 16:20, with 2 additional pilots in the back to act as spotters. They searched along the route of flight until 18:40 and returned to CYQN. JRCC had initiated its response at 15:00, and the first tasked aircraft arrived in the search area at 17:00. The search continued over the following 4 days. The occurrence aircraft was found on 4 March 2023, 30.8 nautical miles north-northwest of CYQN along the direct track to CYFH. Both pilots were fatally injured. The aircraft was destroyed by impact forces. There was no post-crash fire. There was no emergency locator transmitter (ELT) on the occurrence aircraft because it had been removed for recertification. Findings as to causes and contributing factors 1. During the en-route portion of the flight, over a remote area, the pilot lost control of the aircraft for an unknown reason, which resulted in the collision with terrain.

Flight 1369 experienced convective turbulence during the descent from cruise altitude to land at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport (DFW). The captain stated they were briefed and were expecting a mostly smooth flight from Chicago Midway International airport to the Saint Louis area, and then anticipated a âbumpy ride' the remainder of the flight to the DFW, and those were exactly the conditions they encountered.  He said that about halfway through the flight it became rough, and they were allowed to deviate around some convective cells to get a smoother ride. Air traffic control (ATC) also gave an additional reroute to transition south of the weather and return to the same arrival transition east to DFW. The captain said that the ride became smoother, so he turned off the seat belt sign as the flight was descending on the arrival at DFW. During arrival, the flight was given a descent to flight level (FL) 240 and told to maintain 290 knots or better. It was mostly smooth, so the captain kept the seat belt sign off, but as the descent progressed, they started getting some light chop, and all of a sudden experienced âone big, unexpected bump'. The captain said he immediately turned the seat belt sign on and made a call to the flight attendants (FA) to get seated. He said the âA' FA told him that one crew member fell and hit her head and hip and was in pain and unable to get up.  The first officer (FO) stated they were instructed to descend from FL280 to FL240 and during the descent the airplane flew through a cloud that looked âlight with no apparent indications of adverse conditions', but upon entering the cloud the ride went from smooth, to light, to moderate turbulence. There had been no pilot reports (PIREPS) prior to entering the descent, and the flight attendants had been preparing the cabin for landing and were about to be seated. The FO recalled that the seat belt sign was on throughout the descent. The FO said he immediately got on the public address (PA) system and told the flight attendants to be seated, and shortly thereafter they were informed that the âD' flight attendant had been thrown around and was injured. The flight crew informed ATC of the medical event, requested priority handling, and asked for paramedics to meet the airplane at the gate. ATC declared an emergency for the flight crew. The injured flight attendant was on the galley floor and could not get up. She was assisted by another flight attendant and two passenger nurses, and the flight landed otherwise uneventfully. After landing the injured flight attendant was given medical care and diagnosed with a broken hip. Probable Cause: The flight's encounter with convective turbulence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA23LA196 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA23LA196  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates20-Jul-2024 08:32 ASN Update Bot Updated [Time, Total occupants, Other fatalities, Phase, Nature, Source, Narrative, Accident report, ]20-Jul-2024 09:03 ASN Updated [Nature, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

One passenger was fatally injured. The two airline transport pilots and two other passengers were not injured. The airplane incurred minor damage. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 personal flight. The flight crew flew the passengers to their destination the day before the accident, and were conducting the return flight the following day. During the exterior preflight inspection, the second-in-command (SIC) was interrupted by line personnel delivering ice to the airplane and inadvertently failed to remove the right side pitot probe cover. The flight crew completed the remainder of their preflight activities, boarded the passengers, and taxied for takeoff. During takeoff, the SIC observed an anomaly with his right side primary flight display (PFD) airspeed indicator and he called for the pilot-in-command (PIC) to abort the takeoff. The PIC aborted the takeoff and taxied the airplane off the runway onto a taxiway. The SIC suspected that he may have forgotten to remove the pitot probe cover, and while stopped on the taxiway with the right engine running, he exited the airplane and removed the cover. Data recovered from the airplaneâs flight data recorder (FDR) indicated that the crew aborted the takeoff 16 seconds after thrust application, and the airplane reached a maximum speed of 104 knots (kts) as indicated by the left PFD airspeed indicator. The right PFD airspeed indicator data was consistent with the pitot probe remaining covered. While on the taxiway, the PIC began troubleshooting a Crew Alerting System (CAS) cyan (blue) âRUDDER LIMITER FAULTâ advisory message. He also noticed that the flight director was stuck in a pitch mode. He conducted multiple avionics stall tests, which had cleared the message on past flights; however, he was unable to clear the advisory message. The SIC initially indicated that he would call maintenance control; however, after a short discussion with the PIC, both flight crew members agreed to continue the flight with the advisory message posted. The flight crew did not consult the airplaneâs âGo/No-Goâ guide, but if they had, they would have found that the Rudder Limiter Fault advisory message was a âNo-Goâ item, and that the Minimum Equipment List provided no relief to depart with that message displayed. During the subsequent takeoff, the SIC noticed that the airplaneâs V-speeds were no longer referenced (âbuggedâ) on the airspeed indicator, and he called the speeds from memory. When the airplane passed through about 400 ft radio altitude, an amber (yellow) caution âMACH TRIM FAILâ CAS message posted. The PIC turned the airplane on course and shortly after takeoff, turned on the autopilot (AP), after which the CAS immediately displayed an additional amber âAP STAB TRIM FAILâ caution message. During the climb to cruise altitude, the pilot disconnected the autopilot via his use of the horizontal pitch trim control wheel button. Following his trim adjustments and the resulting disconnect of the autopilot, he subsequently reengaged the autopilot two additional times. With each disengagement and reengagement, all AP-related caution messages would clear, and then reappear upon autopilot reengagement. Furthermore, during the second and third engagements, an additional âAP HOLDING NOSE DOWNâ caution message was displayed as airspeed increased in the climb. According to the cockpit voice recorder (CVR), the SIC asked if the autopilot was failing to off, or if the PIC was disengaging the autopilot. The PIC informed the SIC that he disengaged the autopilot, but during the subsequent disengagements and reengagements, he never announced to the SIC that he was turning the autopilot on or off. The SIC advised the captain to not use the autopilot during the climb, to which the PIC agreed. Shortly after receiving the amber CAS caution messages, the PIC called for the SIC to âget the checklist,â but did not call for a specific checklist by name. The flight crew then became fixated on reprogramming the V-speeds into the Flight Management System (FMS), as the SIC believed that the caution messages may have been related to a configuration problem with the V-speeds and FMS since they had cleared following the aborted takeoff. About 8 minutes after the PIC called for the checklist, the SIC located the quick reference card (QRC) and the âPRI STAB TRIM FAILâ [Primary Stabilizer Trim Failure] checklist. The SIC reported in a postaccident interview that he selected this checklist because it was the only trim failure checklist on the QRC, and it seemed to address the root cause of the problem. Although there were multiple CAS messages displayed, he did not consider using any other checklist. The SIC reported that he visually showed the PIC the checklist, and they agreed to execute the checklist. The first action item was to move the stabilizer trim switch (âSTAB TRIMâ), located on the center console, from âPRIâ (Primary) to âOFF.â The SIC read the checklist item aloud and subsequently moved the switch to off. Flight data recorder (FDR) information indicated that, as soon as the switch position was moved, the autopilot disconnected, and the airplane, which had been in a 3Â° nose-up attitude, rapidly pitched up to 11Â° in one second. The normal acceleration then rapidly rose to 4g. The PIC then pushed the control column forward with at least 90 lbs of force, the airplane pitched down to a near nose-level attitude, and the normal acceleration was reduced to -2.3g. The control column was subsequently pulled back through neutral, and the airplane rapidly pitched up to over 20Â° nose-up and more than 4g of normal acceleration. The FDR then stopped recording as the inertial g switch was triggered by the loading. As a result, the full extent of the pitch event was not recorded. The airplaneâs maneuvering load factor limitation was +2.6g. The PIC reported that, immediately before the pitch oscillations, his left hand was on the flight controls and his right hand was guarding the right side of the flight controls. He reported that he did not anticipate the airplane pitching up so rapidly, but he did expect the autopilot to disconnect upon turning the stabilizer trim switch off. Shortly after the in-flight upset, the flight crew were alerted to a passenger that had been seriously injured. The SIC exited the flight deck to check on the passenger and to provide medical attention. He subsequently informed the PIC that there was a medical emergency and that they needed to land. About 17 minutes after the in-flight upset, the flight landed at the diversion airport. Later that day, the passenger succumbed to her injuries sustained during the in-flight upset. Postaccident download of the horizontal stabilizer trim electronic control unit (HSTECU) nonvolatile memory found that, during the aborted takeoff, the speed mismatch between Air Data Computer 1 (ADC1) and ADC2 exceeded 20 kts for more than 5 seconds (due to the covered right pitot probe). This scenario resulted in key faults being recorded in the HSTECU. A review of the logic for these fault messages showed that the HSTECU latched an ""ADC1/ADC2 Miscompare,"" indicating an airspeed data mismatch between ADC1 and ADC2, resulting in the HSTECU posting the Rudder Limiter Fault advisory message. In addition, a âConfirmed Mach Validâ latched to FALSE, which resulted in the Mach Trim Failure message, and the HSTECU inhibiting the autopilot trim function of the stabilizer. The manual stab trim operated at a reduced rate of movement, but was functional. The series of faults introduced into the HSTECU following the aborted takeoff resulted in the crew receiving the âAP STAB TRIM FAILâ CAS caution message upon autopilot engagement, due to the HSTECU inhibiting the autopilot trim function of the stabilizer. With the autopilot engaged and the trim function inhibited, the autopilot subsequently alerted the flight crew to âAP HOLDING NOSE DOWN,â which was meant to alert the crew that the autopilot was on, but that the airplane was out of trim and the autopilot was holding additional load on the flight controls. According to the airplane manufacturer, the âMACH TRIM FAILâ caution message was inhibited by the airplaneâs avionics system and was not displayed to the flight crew on the CAS until the airplane was in the air (weight off wheels) and above 400 ft radio altitude. Flight testing of the accident scenario conducted after the accident, in a like make and model airplane, confirmed that the series of CAS messages likely presented in-flight were âMACH TRIM FAILâ (at 400 ft radio altitude), âAP STAB TRIM FAILâ (upon autopilot engagement), and âAP HOLDING NOSE DOWNâ (upon speed deviation from where the AP was engaged). The testing confirmed that the AP-related CAS messages would clear and then reappear upon autopilot engagement and airspeed changes. The data indicated that there was no HSTECU malfunction other than the faults related to the ADC1 and ADC2 airspeed discrepancy during the initial takeoff. Additionally, there were no faults that would have produced a âPRI STAB TRIM FAILâ CAS message. Both the AP STAB TRIM FAIL and the AP HOLDING NOSE DOWN QRH checklists provided warnings about the airplaneâs out-of-trim condition when those messages were displayed and also warned that abrupt changes in control forces may be experienced when disconnecting the autopilot. The checklists required the flight controls to be held firmly and provided a caution to minimize changes to airspeed and configuration to minimize the out-of-trim state. It is likely that the accident would have been prevented had the pilots completed one of the AP-related checklists; however, the SIC and PIC agreed to complete the PRI STAB TRIM FAIL checklist, despite the CAS not displaying this message. The crew displayed inadequate crew resource management on a number of occasions, beginning with their actions following the aborted takeoff, when they failed to recognize the âRUDDER LIMITER FAULTâ message as a No-Go item. Had the flight crew called their maintenance control as required, they would have been instructed to power down the airplane, which likely would have cleared the HSTECU faults latched during the takeoff as a result of the airspeed discrepancies between ADC1 and ADC2 due to the right pitot probe still being covered. Then, despite the SIC questioning the decision to continue the climb to cruise after receiving the cascading CAS messages, the PIC continued the flight as planned. Additionally, the PIC failed to communicate with the SIC regarding his continued use of the autopilot during the climb even after receiving a warning from the SIC to not use the autopilot and agreeing with the SICâs comments. The PICâs continued use of the autopilot likely contributed to the SICâs difficulty in selecting the correct checklist, given that the AP-related caution messages would disappear each time the autopilot was disconnected, but would reappear once reengaged. The PIC did not call for a specific checklist to address the CAS messages, and when the SIC showed the checklist to the PIC for agreement before they completed it, neither identified the chosen PRI STAB TRIM FAIL checklist as incorrect. According to the CVR transcript, shortly after regaining airplane control, both crew members acknowledged that the autopilot should not have been used during the climb. The fatally injured passengerâs seatbelt was not fastened at the time of the in-flight upset. The PIC reported that the seatbelt sign was on for the entire flight, and that his regular practice was to never turn it off. The in-flight upset occurred near 23,000 ft, about 9 minutes into the flight. It is likely that the passengers had no expectation for the seatbelt sign to be turned off at any time during the flight, given that they regularly flew with this flight crew. As a result, the passengers had to use their own judgement regarding whether it was safe to get up and move about the cabin. Had the flight crew chosen the correct QRH checklist, they would have been warned of the possible abrupt change in control force upon autopilot disengagement and could have ensured that the passengers were seated with seatbelts fastened before completing the non-normal procedure. Then, even if an in-flight upset occurred, serious injury likely could have been avoided entirely by each passenger simply being seated with their seatbelt fastened. There were no other serious injuries reported from any other occupant on board. The sequence of events that ultimately led to the accident originated with the flight crewâs failure to remove the right pitot probe cover before takeoff and their subsequent decision to depart with a No-Go CAS message. Although the message was advisory and not cautionary in nature, the airplane was indirectly alerting the flight crew to additional faults that had been introduced into the airplaneâs systems following the aborted takeoff. The crewâs continuation of the flight with an unairworthy airplane directly contributed to the subsequent series of CAS messages, which the crew mis-diagnosed during the climb, resulting in the in-flight upset and loss of airplane control. Probable Cause: The flight crewâs failure to remove the right side pitot probe cover before flight, their decision to depart with a No-Go advisory message following an aborted takeoff, and their selection of the incorrect non-normal checklist in flight, which resulted in an in-flight upset that exceeded the maneuvering load factor limitations of the airplane and resulted in fatal injuries to a passenger whose seatbelt was not fastened. Contributing to the severity of the in-flight upset were the pilot-in-commandâs (PIC) decision to continue the climb and use the autopilot while troubleshooting the non-normal situation, and the PICâs pilot-induced oscillations following the autopilot disconnecting from the out-of-trim condition. Also contributing to the accident was the crewâs inadequate crew resource management.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA23LA135 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: https://patch.com/connecticut/windsorlocks/passenger-dead-after-plane-diverts-bradley-airport  https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=106816  https://registry.faa.gov/AircraftInquiry/Search/NNumberResult?nNumberTxt=300ER  https://globe.adsbexchange.com/?icao=a31fc6&lat=42.130&lon=-72.652&zoom=10.0&showTrace=2023-03-03Ãtamp=1677876313  https://flightaware.com/live/flight/XSR300/history/20230303/1945Z/KEEN/KJYO  https://www.aircraft.com/aircraft/216129907/n300er-2013-bombardier-challenger-300  https://cdn.jetphotos.com/full/6/40430_1660050434.jpg (photo)  Location  Images: Photo: View of the forward right side of the airplane and probe covers installed (NTSB) Photo: View of the cabin area (FBI) Media:NTSB is investigating the March 3 turbulence event involving a Bombardier Challenger 300 airplane that diverted to Windsor Locks, Connecticut and resulted in fatal injuries to a passenger.â NTSB Newsroom (@NTSB_Newsroom) March 4, 2023 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates06-Dec-2024 18:11 Captain Adam Updated [Location, Source, Damage, Narrative, Accident report, Photo, ]06-Dec-2024 18:12 Captain Adam Updated [Photo, ] Corrections or additions? ...

Upon being notified of the injury, the flight crew declared an emergency and diverted to Denver, Colorado for medical assistance. The flight crew reported that before departure, the purser (lead flight attendant) was asked to have the flight attendants remain seated until the 10,000 ft signal due to weather conditions at the departure airport. After departure, airspeed fluctuations and turbulence were encountered with a smooth ride once the airplane was above a cloud layer. About 12,000 ft the captain gave the 10,000 ft signal that it was safe for the flight attendants to begin the initial service.  When the flight was about 32 miles northeast of SFO the flight crew established communication with Oakland Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) while climbing through flight level (FL) 175 [17,500 ft]. The controller advised them to expect occasional light turbulence up to FL 260 and instructed them to climb to FL350.   Shortly thereafter, as the airplane climbed through 19,000 ft, the flight encountered unexpected turbulence for about 5 seconds. The flight crew then received a call from the cabin advising them that a flight attendant had fractured her leg.  At the time of the turbulence event, one of the flight attendants was in the aft galley preparing her cart for the initial service when she felt âviolent up and down jolting turbulence'. She attempted to move towards the nearest jump seat when another âintense bump' occurred. She was thrown into the air and impacted the floor fracturing her leg.  Airmen's Meteorological Information (AIRMETs) were in effect at the time of the accident for moderate turbulence below 12,000 ft and moderate turbulence from FL220 to FL360. A convective Significant Meteorological Information (SIGMET) was issued at 1455 PDT and in effect at the time of the accident for the area with areas of thunderstorms forecast with tops to FL290. A convective SIGMET implies severe or greater turbulence, severe icing, and low-level windshear. Numerous pilot reports (PIREPs) reporting moderate or greater turbulence were issued for central California (including the accident area) within two hours of the accident time.

The flight was a regularly scheduled international passenger flight from Mexico City, Mexico to KIAH. According to the flight crew, the captain was the pilot monitoring, and the first officer (FO) was the pilot flying when they were cleared for the visual approach to runway 27 at KIAH. The airplane was in the landing configuration and on a stabilized approach at 1,000 ft. above ground level (AGL).  About 60 ft AGL the captain noticed the airspeed begin to decay and stated watch your speed. The FO subsequently pitched the nose of the airplane down and added a little thrust. About 30 ft AGL, due to a higher-than-normal rate of descent the captain commanded flare, flare, flare. The FO flared the airplane which resulted in a firm landing. As the airplane rebounded from the firm landing the spoilers deployed resulting in a nose high attitude. In an effort to correct for the nose high attitude, the captain and FO pushed forward on their respective sidesticks.  The FO stated that the ground spoiler deployment coinciding with the firm touchdown resulted in an airplane nose-up pitch attitude. As a result, the pitch attitude increased until the tail struck the runway. After the tailstrike, the remainder of the landing and landing rollout were normal with no risk of runway overrun or excursion.  The tailstrike resulted in abrasion damage over an area of about 19 feet long by 1 foot wide along the aft lower fuselage. An inspection revealed substantial damage to the aft pressure bulkhead and frames.

After the event, the airplane completed two additional flights before the damage was discovered by maintenance personnel. The flight was an on-demand international cargo flight from Willow Run Airport (YIP), Detroit, Michigan, to SLW. The flight crew stated that, upon arrival at SLW, they conducted an instrument landing system (ILS) approach to runway 17. A review of flight data recorder (FDR) data revealed that the autopilot and autothrottle were disconnected at about 1,400 ft above ground level (agl). The airplane was in a stabilized configuration on approach, with glideslope and localizer deviations of less than one dot. Airspeed varied by less than 5 knots and the sink rate was less than 1,000 feet per minute (fpm). The crew indicated that the flight was âslightly bumpyâ on final approach with small fluctuations in airspeed. They stated that it felt as though the wind had shifted or dissipated rapidly while approaching 50 feet agl resulting in a higher-than-normal sink rate. FDR data showed that near 80 ft radio altitude (RA), the aircraftâs sink rate began to increase rapidly, indicating a sudden decrease in headwind. The control column was deflected airplane nose-up (ANU) in an apparent attempt to arrest the sink rate. FDR data showed that the control column remained deflected ANU until about 30 ft RA, when the airplaneâs pitch increased to nearly 5 degrees ANU. Subsequently, an airplane nose-down (AND) column input was initiated. The airplane continued to descend at a sink rate of over 15 feet per second (fps) just before touchdown, resulting in a hard landing with a peak vertical acceleration of 3.24 gravitational force equivalent (g). The tail strike likely occurred at the touchdown point where the airplane's pitch attitude reached approximately 8 degrees, exceeding the attitude limit where the aft body of the aircraft would contact the ground once the landing gear was compressed. Based on this information, and a review of several takeoffs and landings led to the determination that the tailstrike occurred at SLW. The crew indicated that the aircraft touched down harder than normal, that the airplane did not bounce, and they did not feel as if a tail strike had occurred. During a post-flight inspection at SLW, the crew stated that they did not observe any damage to the fuselage and the tail skid assembly's tailstrike indicator was in a horizontal position (parallel to the fuselage), indicating a tail strike had not occurred, see figure 1. The trip continued from SLW to Windsor Airport (YQG), Windsor, Ontario Canada, and then to YIP. During a maintenance pre-flight inspection at YIP a day after the accident, external damage to the fuselage, missed during the flight crewâs walk-around in SLW, was discovered. Further inspection of the airplane revealed substantial damage to internal structural members of the lower fuselage. The tail skid assembly was removed from the airplane and sent to the Boeing equipment quality analysis (EQA) laboratory for examination. No mechanical anomalies were found with the unit that would have affected the tail bumper strut from properly stroking and rebounding when pressurized and installed on the airplane. Although contamination, metallic and organic, larger than the design specification was found within the unit, it could not be determined how it affected the operation of the unit. Probable Cause: The pilot's failure to adequately compensate for a wind shift while on short final approach which resulted in a higher than normal sink rate and a tailstrike.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA23LA232  https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=107036  https://flightaware.com/live/flight/N834US/history/20230324/1200Z/KYIP/MMIO  https://cdn.jetphotos.com/full/6/592086_1676198256.jpg (photo) History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  11 March 2022 N832US USA Jet Airlines 0 Niagara Falls International Airport, NY (IAG/KIAG) unk Location  Images: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates17-Apr-2023 13:16 Captain Adam Added 04-Oct-2023 21:52 Captain Adam Updated 18-Aug-2024 22:14 Captain Adam Updated [Time, Source, Narrative, Accident report, Photo, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The pilot and three passengers were not injured.  The pilot reported that he had recently completed his initial training, and the accident flight was his first flight in the airplane. The pilot entered the traffic pattern with the autopilot engaged and was told by the co-pilot to ""keep it tight."" The autopilot did not command a steep enough bank, and the pilot disconnected the autopilot in an attempt to align with the runway centerline. On final approach about 50 ft above ground level (agl), the airplane was aligned to the right of the runway centerline. The airplane landed hard, bounced multiple times, exited the runway, and impacted a runway sign. The pilot then executed a go-around and landed without further incident at OKC. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing spar. Probable Cause: The pilotÂs improper landing flare, which resulted in a hard, bounced landing, runway excursion, and subsequent collision with a runway sign. Contributing to the accident was the pilotÂs lack of experience in the airplane, the unstabilized approach, and inadequate crew resource management.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN23LA148 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: globe.adsbexchange.com/  kfor.com   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot was not injured.  The business jet was equipped with Tamarack Active Technology Load Alleviation System (ATLAS) wing extensions (via supplemental type certificate) that included winglets and wing extension-mounted aerodynamic control surfaces that automatically deployed to counteract measured structural loads. Before the airplane's descent from flight level (FL) 310, the weather was clear with no turbulence. When the airplane was descending through FL 300 for FL 270, the pilot felt 'two jolts of sudden turbulence' that he described as a negative G followed by a significant positive G twice in the span of about 1 second. The pilot noted that the airplane was yawing, and he subsequently observed that the left winglet had separated, resulting in substantial damage to the airplane. He declared an emergency and landed without further incident at a nearby airport.  Review of automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast and GPS revealed that, during the airplane's descent, its airspeed was slightly outside the airplane manufacturer's maximum operating speed (VMO/MMO) performance envelope. At the time of winglet separation, the airplane was descending about 5,300 ft per minute at 275 knots calibrated airspeed. Eleven days after the accident, the separated winglet was recovered from the Gulf of Mexico; however, the section of the left wing extension that included the aerodynamic control surface was not recovered. Metallurgical examination of the recovered components revealed overstress features and no evidence of fatigue. Additionally, systems testing of the aerodynamic control surface control units, the system computer, and the enhanced ground proximity warning system revealed no anomalies.  Because the aerodynamic control surface on the left wing extension was not recovered, the reason for the left wing extension and winglet separation could not be determined. Probable Cause: The separation of the left wing extension and winglet for reasons that could not be determined based on the available evidence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA23FA174 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB ERA23FA174  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates20-Jul-2024 08:32 ASN Update Bot Updated [Time, Operator, Other fatalities, Source, Narrative, ]20-Jul-2024 09:02 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

Following an uneventful flight, the aircraft touched down on runway 28L, in crosswind conditions, with a crab angle of approximately three degrees to the left, relative to the runway magnetic heading of 277 degrees. The aircraft tracked towards the left edge of the runway before turning back through the runway centreline and eventually coming to a stop at a runway exit on the right-hand side of the runway. During the ground roll, the aircraft nosewheels were severely damaged with one wheel and tyre departing the aircraft completely, and the other wheel being ground down to its axle, while its tyre also suffered significant abrasion and loss of material. There was damage to the airframe due to debris. There were no injuries and there was no fire. The passengers and crew disembarked the aircraft through the left rear (L2) door using mobile stairs and were taken to the terminal buildings by bus.

The seventeen passengers and crew were not injured.  The flight crew did not receive a down and locked indication after selecting the gear down in preparation for landing at FRS. The pilot decided to perform two flyovers, requesting visual verification of the landing gear's condition from the control tower.  The observers on the ground did not notice any abnormalities.  However, during landing rollout, the right main landing gear collapsed, causing the aircraft to slide on its right wing. This resulted in damages to the wing tip, propeller, engine, and runway lights. Subsequently, there was a runway excursion towards the right side.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: UIA Costa Rica Report number: UIA-A-05-2023 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: soy502.com  tah.de  flightaware.com History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  16 May 2021 TG-TAI Transportes AÃ©reos Guatemaltecos (TAG) Airlines 0 Juan Manuel GÃ¡lvez International Airport (RTB/MHRO) min Collision with other aircraft on apron Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates10-Jan-2024 19:01 harro Updated [Other fatalities, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

As a result of the turbulence, three flight attendants sustained injuries, two being serious, while one passenger sustained a minor injury. The airplane was not damaged, and the flight crew continued to MAD where they were met by emergency medical technicians (EMTs) upon landing.  The flight was a regularly scheduled passenger flight from Charlotte International Airport (CLT), Charlotte, North Carolina to MAD.  The flight crew reported having a view of lightning at about an 11 o'clock position. The onboard radar also indicated rain ahead of them. Upon confirming that the sky above them was clear of any cloud cover or weather, the flight crew requested an up to 20-mile deviation of course to avoid the weather ahead, to which air traffic control (ATC) approved. As they approached the area where the radar had previously shown that there was rain, the radar was no longer showing rain and the flight crew could see no signs of rain directly ahead of them.  The flight crew reported attempts to reference both of their personal weather apps to confirm the weather shown on the cockpit radar but was unsuccessful due to the lack of internet connection. Because of this, the flight crew concluded the weather to have passed and subsequently decided to no longer deviate from the original course. The unexpected turbulence event was experienced soon after. The flight crew reported that the turbulence was sudden and came without warning. The cabin crew reported they were preparing for arrival service into MAD when they experienced a âsudden loss in altitude' and a series of jolts. The flight and cabin crew both reported that the turbulence lasted around 30 - 40 seconds and that flight crew reported that the autopilot disengaged but did not cause a deviation in altitude of more than 200 feet.  Three flight attendants reported they were preparing the back galley for meal service when the unexpected turbulence occurred, causing all three flight attendants to be thrown in the air and âslammed' on the floor. The flight attendants also reported that a passenger was thrown in the air and hit their head. After landing, the three flight attendants were seen by EMTs, and all were taken to the local hospital for further care. The flight crew was aware of thunderstorms in the area, subsequently the seatbelt sign was on, but no announcement was made to inform passengers or cabin crew of potential turbulence.  The flight crew informed ATC about the injuries and requested EMTs to meet the airplane upon arrival. Probable Cause: An encounter with inadvertent convective turbulence during cruise flight.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA23LA252 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA23LA252  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates26-Apr-2023 12:48 Captain Adam Added 20-May-2024 16:42 ASN Updated [Location, ]20-Jul-2024 08:32 ASN Update Bot Updated [Time, Operator, Other fatalities, Country, Nature, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, ]20-Jul-2024 08:58 ASN Updated [Operator, Location, Nature, Destination airport, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

During cruise, the crew received multiple warnings, including cargo smoke, avionics smoke and cabin pressure. The crew subsequently detected thick smoke in the cockpit, donned oxygen, conducted an emergency descent and diverted the aircraft to Cobar. The post-flight inspection revealed fire damage in the vicinity of the right air cycle machine and cargo bay floor. Contributing factors â¢ It was likely that an electrical component of a control circuit board on the recirculating fan failed, resulting in an in-flight fire under the cabin floor. â¢ The smoke curtain was not fitted as required for the cargo configuration, and the flight deck door was open, which allowed smoke from the in-flight fire to enter the flight deck. â¢ The underfloor fire caused weakening of the fuselage structure, which led to a subsequent depressurisation of the aircraft during the descent. However, the depressurisation aided in the removal of enough smoke from the flight deck on approach to allow an unhindered visual approach at Cobar. â¢ Crew were not familiar with the cargo configuration and were unaware of the smoke curtain requirements and location of the cross-valve handle. â¢ The Pel-Air and Rex Saab 340 flight crew operating manuals did not include reference to the location and operation of the cross-valve handle or the operation and use of the smoke curtain. (Safety issue) â¢ Rex did not ensure its flight crews received training in the differences between passenger and freight-configured Saab 340 aircraft, prior to being scheduled to fly freight operations. (Safety issue) â¢ Saab did not include the smoke curtain fitment in pre-flight documentation for the cargo-configured Saab 340 aircraft to inform flight crew of this difference from the passenger-configured version.

The flight was a regularly scheduled domestic passenger flight from Fort Lauderdale, FL to CLT. According to the flight crew, the captain was the pilot flying, and the first officer (FO) was the pilot monitoring when they were cleared to land on runway 18L at CLT. The airplane was in the landing configuration and on a stabilized approach at 1,000 ft. above ground level (AGL). While crossing the runway's threshold the wind shifted from a 6 -7 knot headwind component to a 6â7 knot tailwind component, the airspeed began to decay, and the airplane's sink rate increased. In an effort to correct for the sink rate the captain applied back sidestick. The airplane touched down firmly and bounced, coincidentally the ground spoilers deployed which resulted in a nose high attitude. The airplane touched down a second time decelerated and taxied uneventfully to the gate.  The captain stated that the ground spoiler deployment coinciding with the bounced touchdown resulted in an airplane nose-up pitch attitude. As a result, the pitch attitude increased until the tail struck the runway. After the tailstrike, and subsequent touchdown the remainder of the landing and landing rollout were normal with no risk of runway overrun or excursion.  The tailstrike resulted in abrasion damage along the aft lower fuselage, over an area of about 14 feet long by 2 feet wide. An inspection revealed substantial damage to several frames. Probable Cause: The captain's failure to maintain the appropriate airspeed and pitch attitude during landing which resulted in a tailstrike.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA23LA278 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA23LA278  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates09-May-2023 05:49 harro Added 09-May-2023 05:50 harro Updated 25-May-2023 07:46 Captain Adam Updated 28-Jul-2023 17:37 ASN Update Bot Updated 30-Jul-2023 07:44 harro Updated Corrections or additions? ...

The three occupants were killed. The airplane departed Point Mugu Naval Air Station (NTD) at 07:23 as the lead airplane in formation with a second Learjet airplane utilizing the callsigns FENIX01 (N56PA) and FENIX02 (N544PA). The flight proceeded south towards San Clemente Island with the FENIX02 flying in close formation with FENIX01. The purpose of the flight was to participate in training exercises with the United States Navy in Warning Area 291 (W291). There were three civilian crewmembers onboard each airplane. Shortly after entering W291, at 15,000 ft mean sea level (MSL), the aircrew of FENIX02 observed the lead airplaneÂs flaps partially deploy. They notified the lead airplane, who acknowledged the radio call. The aircrew of FENIX02 then observed the flaps retract. Seconds later, the aircrew of FENIX01 radioed that they detected an odor in the cabin. The aircrew of FENIX02 then radioed that observed white or gray colored 'smoke or gas' coming from the 'left side AFT Cabin area.' Unidentified fluid was also observed trailing the airplane. At this point the lead airplane was not maintaining heading or altitude. FENIX02 then observed flames coming from around the aft equipment door and told the aircrew of FENIX01 that they were on fire and to declare an emergency. The aircrew of FENIX01 declared an emergency and their intentions to land at San Clemente Island Naval Auxiliary Landing Field (NUC). FENIX02 then took over as lead for the formation flight and maneuvered in front of FENIX01 to lead them to the airfield. FENIX02 last observed and heard radio transmissions from FENIX01 as they descended through about 9,000 feet. FENIX01 proceeded on about a 165Â° heading until about 30 miles south of NUC, where the airplane began a left turn. FENIX01 subsequently made a series of descending turns before it impacted the water one mile offshore from San Clemente Island in about 300 ft of water.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: WPR23FA185 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: latimes.com  sgvtribune.com  flightaware.com   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

At 16:51:30, after dumping approximately 40 tons of fuel at FL100, the aircraft was vectored back to ELLX for an ILS3 approach to RWY 06. At 16:59:04 the aircraft was cleared to land on RWY 06.  When the aircraft touched down at 17:00:46, the wheel truck of the RH BLG with part of the inner cylinder attached separated from the aircraft. In this process, the separated gear assembly impacted the lower part of the aft fuselage multiple times and struck the righthand horizontal stabilizer. The crew was not aware of the RH BLG separation until they were informed by the tower that the aircraft had lost part of its landing gear on touchdown with four wheels attached. The crew then immobilized the aircraft on the runway. Airport surveillance video footage showed that after becoming airborne, the RH BLG wheel truck initially rotated to a normal pitch-up position before an over-extension of the strut could be observed. The over-extension was accompanied by a vapor release. During climb out, the RH BLG wheel truck could be observed in a pitch-down position. It was found that the upper bearing carrier had failed, with the bearing and piston ring retention lands sheared off.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ATI Report number: AET/AC-2024/01 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Preliminary report Sources: www.rtl.lu  flightradar24.com History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  21 January 2010 LX-OCV Cargolux 0 Luxembourg-Findel Airport (LUX) min Runway mishap Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates06-Aug-2024 12:17 ASN Updated [Narrative, Accident report, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

On the day of the occurrence, six Learjet flight crews of the operator involved planned to take off almost at the same time from Hohn Military Airport to different missions. The airplane involved was the third to take off. Two pilots were on board of the Learjet 35A. The Pilot Flying (PF) sat in the left-hand seat and the Pilot Monitoring (PM) in the right. It was planned to fly from Hohn to Wunstorf Military Airport and conduct several instrument approaches for training purposes of the local air traffic control personnel. At the same time, the flight was to be used as proficiency check for the pilot in the left-hand seat for his type and instrument rating for Learjet 20/30. The airrcraft taxied to the runway and at 12:37, while still on taxiway C3, the take-off emergency briefing was performed with the words: ""[...] when airborne keine [no] Items ausser [except] gear below 500 ft, continue climb, in real life accelerate to V2 plus 30, Klappen [flaps] rein, slight climb weiter auf [to] [...]"". At 12:38 another Learjet received take-off clearance with simulated engine failure from the Tower. That flight crew asked over the radio if the single engine take-off was approved and the Tower once again acknowledged it. After the take-off of that Learjet, the flight crew taxied with the airplane involved on the runway to Ramp 1, turned and waited for the clearance to line up on runway 26. At 12:44, the flight crew received the instruction to roll on to runway 26 and wait. They completed the Line-up check and the Before Take-off check. They planned to take-off with flaps 8Â° and engine full thrust with N1 of 96.6%. After they had received take-off clearance at about 12:47 the airplane accelerated and took off. According to the CVR recording, after take-off the PF instructed the PM to retract the landing gear and engage the Yaw Damper. At 12:47:39, the PM responded with: ""Vorab verlierst du simuliert das rechte Triebwerk (in advance, you will lose the right engine)"", the PF acknowledged it by saying: ""Copy, gear up"". Then the thrust of the right engine reduced, the left engine maintained the set take-off thrust. At that time, indicated speed was about 160 kt, according to the FDR. At 12:47:44, the PF instructed: ""Damper on"". At 12:47:45, the PM answered ""Jawohl (yes)"", almost at the same time the PF said quietly: ""Oh shit"". At 12:47:44, the PF called out loud several times: ""Fuck"" and at 12:47:54 the PM several times ""Shit"". At 12:47:55, the last recording was the landing gear warning generated by the airplane: ""Too low"". From the PMâs announcement about the simulated engine failure at 12:47:39 until the impact, Hohn Tower transmitted traffic information regarding two Tornado aircraft in the vicinity and instructed the frequency change to Hohn Radar. Witnesses observed that the airplane performed a sort of snap roll and then crashed to the ground at the end of the runway. On impact, an explosive fireball occurred. The pilots suffered fatal injuries and the airplane was destroyed. Conclusions: The accident, loss of control of the airplane, was the result of an untimely or significantly too low rudder deflection to correct the asymmetric thrust after initiation of a simulated engine failure. The large yaw angle resulted in a stall of the vertical tail and on the wing and an uncontrolled roll of the airplane. It was not possible to determine without doubt the reason for the untimely or significantly too low rudder deflection.METAR: 10:20 UTC / 12:20 local time: ETNH 151020Z 03007KT 9999 FEW050 21/03 Q1010 BLU+BLU+10:50 UTC / 12:50 local time: ETNH 151050Z 07006KT 9999 FEW050 21/04 Q1010 BLU+BLU+Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BFU Report number: BFU23-0311-1X Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: www.ndr.de  globe.adsbexchange.com/  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates14-Jun-2024 09:53 ASN Updated [Location, Narrative, Accident report, ]14-Jun-2024 09:56 ASN Updated [Nature, Destination airport, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were no injuries to the passengers and crew onboard either airplane, and the Endeavor Air airplane received substantial damage. Endeavor Air flight 4994 was operating under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 as a regularly scheduled passenger flight, and ITA Airways flight 610 was operating under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 129 as a scheduled international passenger flight. Endeavor Air flight 4994 landed on runway 22L at JFK and proceeded on taxiway juliet, then to taxiway alpha, and then initiated a turn onto taxiway KF into the ramp area. The Endeavor Air flight crew reported being cleared to enter the Terminal 4 ramp and taxi to gate B44. Ramp control advised the flight crew to give way to traffic parking at gate B42 before parking at their assigned gate. The Endeavor Air flight crew moved forward onto taxiway KF, and the flight crew stated they pulled as far forward as they could into the ramp area but could not pull any further forward due to an airplane awaiting to park at another gate. The flight crew remained stationary and continued to monitor ground and ramp frequencies while waiting to park at their assigned gate. ITA Airways flight 610 landed on runway 22L and taxied to the ramp area using taxiway alpha. The flight crew reported they saw the Endeavor Air airplane turning onto taxiway KF and recalled the Endeavor Air airplane stopping as soon as it entered the taxiway. As ITA Airways proceeded on taxiway alpha, the captain, who was the pilot monitoring, noticed the tail of the Endeavor Air airplane was close to taxiway alpha and reduced ground speed. The ITA Airways flight crew stated they presumed they were clear of the Endeavor Air airplane since their airplane was taxiing on the centerline of taxiway alpha. The Endeavor Air flight crew reported feeling a severe shaking which prompted them to look out of the left side of the airplane where they observed that the ITA Airways airplane was missing its right winglet. This prompted the Endeavor Air flight crew to conclude their airplane may have been struck by ITA Airways airplane and they instructed air traffic control (ATC) that their airplane needed to remain stationary until the damages were confirmed and an exterior check could be performed.  ITA Airways flight 610 proceeded to their gate. Post accident inspection revealed substantial damage to the right elevator and horizontal stabilizer structure of Endeavor Airâs airplane, and minor damage to the right winglet of ITA Airwaysâ airplane.

The passengers had disembarked from the aircraft but the crew were still on board. One of the vehicles from the ground handling company reversed towards the aircraft, in order to empty the aircraftâs toilet tank. During the reversing manoeuvre, the driver stopped after hearing a series of unusual beeps. After consulting with his employer, the driver carefully continued reversing. During this manoeuvre, the platform on the back of the vehicle started to rise, of its own accord. As a consequence, a section of the railing around the platform punched a hole in the fuselage of the aircraft. The platform can only be operated from outside the vehicle.  Besides the driver, who was sat in the cab, no one was in the vicinity of the vehicle. Following a technical investigation of the vehicle and the platform by the ground handling company, together with the manufacturer, no cause was discovered for the spontaneous rising of the platform.

No emergency were declared by the flight crew, however, the ATC provided some priority to the flight.  The Airbus made a safe landing on the runway 36 of Centrair at 07:41 LT.  At 07:44 LT, emergency evacuation using slides was carried out on the taxiway A just south of vacating from A3.  Five passengers received minor injuries of scratch during the evacuation.   The sole runway was closed until 12:15 LT.  63 commercial flights were canceled, more delays and diversions happened.   No explosive device was found by a search after the evacuation.   On 10th February, JCAB rated this occurrence as an accident since it was revealed that one of the five injured passengers had suffered a serious injury of sacral fracture by evacuation.  JTSB launched an investigation.

The captain and one of the passengers died in the accident. The aircraft operated on a round trip from Naryan-Mar Airport (NNM) to Ust-Kara Airstrip and back via Karatayka. At 13:20 the aircraft took off from Ust-Kara and headed for Karatayka. Due to bad weather conditions, the flight aborted the approach to Karatayka. The captain decided to head to the alternate, Varandey Airport.  The aircraft climbed to an altitude of 200 m, but the aircraft was only able to maintain that altitude using takeoff power. The captain then decided to perform a forced landing. By then the windows had frozen up because the window heating did not work. The aircraft descended until it struck the ground. Conclusion The aviation accident involving the An-2 aircraft RA-71165 occurred during a forced landing, which was necessitated by the inability to continue the flight due to the impact of icing on the aircraft's aerodynamic and thrust characteristics.  Contributing factors included: - The captain's failure to consider potential risks of the aircraft encountering icing conditions when making the decision to take off; - The captain's delayed decision to change the flight plan despite receiving information about deteriorating meteorological conditions at the destination, which fell below the established thresholds for VFR (Visual Flight Rules) night flights and indicated the possibility of aircraft icing; - Non-compliance with VFR rules regarding prolonged flight in actual icing conditions.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: vk.com/okrugnao  nao24.ru   Location  Images: photo (c) MAK; Karatayka; January 2023 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates15-Jul-2024 13:38 ASN Updated [Narrative, Accident report, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The crew performed a visual approach and subsequently landed on runway 10. Reversers were deployed and brakes were applied.  At the end of the rollout the aircraft made a sharp left turn, causing it to veer off the runway and roll downhill. The sudden yaw occurred as the pilot stowed the reversers. Both pilots used the brakes but were not able to counter the yaw. Subsequently, the captain attempted to extend the reversers again, but they did not deploy. At that moment, a lateral excursion to the left side of the runway occurred, resulting in the aircraft moving outside the North safety area of Runway 10-28 and descending into the vegetation zone.

The aircraft crashed on the bank of Seti River and partially ended up in a deep gorge, killing all 72 on board.  The flight was operated by two captains, one captain was in the process of obtaining aerodrome familiarization for operating into Pokhara and the other captain being the instructor pilot. The captain being familiarized, who was occupying the left hand seat, was the Pilot Flying (PF) and the instructor pilot, occupying the right hand seat, was the Pilot Monitoring (PM). They had operated two sectors between Kathmandu and Pokhara earlier in the morning. The take-off, climb, cruise and descent to Pokhara was normal. During the first contact with Pokhara tower the Air Traffic Controller (ATC) assigned the runway 30 to land. At a later time, the flight crew requested and received clearance from ATC to land on runway 12. At 10:51:36, the aircraft descended from 6,500 feet and joined the downwind track for runway 12 to the north of the runway. The aircraft was visually identified by ATC during the approach. At 10:56:12, the pilots extended the flaps to the 15 degrees position and selected the landing gears lever to the down position. The take-off (TO) setting was selected on power management panel. At 10:56:27, the PF disengaged the Autopilot System (AP) at an altitude of 721 feet Above Ground Level (AGL). The PF then called for ""FLAPS 30"" at 10:56:32, and the PM replied, ""Flaps 30 and descending"". The flight data recorder (FDR) data did not record any flap movement at that time. Instead, the propeller rotation speed (Np) of both engines decreased simultaneously to less than 25% and the torque (Tq) started decreasing to 0%, which is consistent with both propellers going into the feathered condition. This was followed by a single Master Caution chime.  The flight crew then carried out the ""Before Landing Checklist"" before starting the left turn onto the base leg. During that time, the power lever angle increased from 41% to 44%. At the point, Np of both propellers were recorded as Non-Computed Data (NCD) in the FDR and the torque (Tq) of both engines were at 0%.  At 10:56:50 when the radio altitude callout for five hundred feet was annunciated, another 'click' sound was heard, likely the crew had inhibited the master caution light. The aircraft reached a maximum bank angle of 30 degrees at this altitude. The yaw damper disconnected four seconds later. The PF consulted the PM on whether to continue the left turn and the PM replied to continue the turn. Subsequently, the PF asked the PM on whether to continue descend and the PM responded it was not necessary and instructed to apply a little power. At 10:56:54, another click was heard, followed by the flaps surface movement to the 30 degrees position. When ATC gave the clearance for landing at 10:57:07, the PF mentioned twice that there was no power coming from the engines. At 10:57:11, the power levers were advanced first to 62 degrees then to the maximum power position. It was followed by a 'click' sound at 10:57:16. One second afterwards, the aircraft was at the initiation of its last turn at 368 feet AGL, the high-pressure turbine speed (Nh) of both engines increased from 73% to 77%. At 10:57:18 the PF handed over control of the aircraft to the PM and the PM (who was previously the PF) repeated again that there was no power from the engines. At 10:57:24 when the aircraft was at 311 feet AGL, the stick shaker was activated. At 10:57:26, a second sequence of stick shaker warning was activated when the aircraft banked towards the left abruptly. Thereafter, the radio altitude alert for two hundred feet was annunciated, and the cricket sound and stick shaker ceased. At 10:57:32, the aircraft impacted the ground.  The Pokhara International Airport was opened on January 1, 2023 and is located to the east-southeast of the old Pokhara Airport. The most probable cause of the accident is determined to be the inadvertent movement of both condition levers to the feathered position in flight, which resulted in feathering of both propellers and subsequent loss of thrust, leading to an aerodynamic stall and collision with terrain. The contributing factors to the accident are: 1 High workload due to operating into a new airport with surrounding terrain and the crew missing the associated flight deck and engine indications that both propellers had been feathered. 2 Human factor issues such as high workload and stress that appears to have resulted in the misidentification and selection of the propellers to the feathered position. 3 The proximity of terrain requiring a tight circuit to land on runway 12. This tight circuit was not the usual visual circuit pattern and contributed to the high workload. This tight pattern also meant that the approach did not meet the stabilised visual approach criteria. 4 Use of visual approach circuit for RWY 12 without any evaluation, validation and resolution of its threats which were highlighted by the SRM team of CAAN and advices proposed in flight procedures design report conducted by the consultant and without the development and approval of the chart by the operator and regulator respectively. 5 Lack of appropriate technical and skill based training (including simulator) to the crew and proper classroom briefings (for that flight) for the safe operation of flight at new airport for visual approach to runway 12. 6 Non-compliance with SOPs, ineffective CRM and lack of sterile cockpit discipline.METAR: 04:30 UTC / 10:15 local time: VNPR METAR 0430Z 17003KT 070V190 6000 FEW025 14/09 Q1016 NOSIG05:00 UTC / 10:45 local time: VNPR METAR 0500Z 12005KT 080V160 6000 FEW025 14/09 Q1015 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: Nepal AAIC Report number: prelim.report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: kathmandupost.com History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  17 June 2016 HS-DRD Nok Air 0 near Chumphon min Windscreen cracks or failure Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates28-Dec-2023 15:21 harro Updated [Other fatalities, Damage, Narrative, Accident report, ]13-Dec-2024 15:45 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The Boeing faced sideways and made a contact with a parked main deck loader, causing a 15 cm hole in the fuselage skin between the radome and a nose landing gear door.  No personal injuries were reported.  JTSB launched an investigation as an accident.   The airport was partially covered with ice and was blown by strong gust of winds at the time of the accident.   Probable Cause: The JTSB concludes that it is certain that the probable cause of this accident was that while turning toward the Spot, the aircraft slid on the icy surface on the Spot and the PIC became unable to control the taxiing of the aircraft, thus the aircraft collided with a ground service equipment parking around the Spot, resulting in damage to the airframe. The aircraft slid on the icy surface probably because the surface conditions on the Spot had not been fully improved for the taxing of the aircraft, and its taxiing speed was not the one to cope with the surface conditions on the Spot. The surface conditions on the Spot had not been fully improved because the spray range and amount of the anti-icing agents were inappropriate, which probably contributed to it. In addition, the aircraftâs taxiing speed was not the one to cope with the surface conditions on the Spot probably because the information that would affect the taxiing of aircraft was not provided to the flight crewmembers of the aircraft from the ground.METAR: METAR (accident time 24/2245Z):  RJAA 242230Z 28015G25KT 250V320 9999 FEW030 M03/M18 Q1012 NOSIG RMK 1CU030 A2991= RJAA 242330Z 29015KT 250V310 9999 FEW030 M02/M18 Q1013 TEMPO 29020G32KT RMK 1CU030 A2994=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JTSB Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: https://www.yomiuri.co.jp/national/20230125-OYT1T50093/  https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20230125/k10013959941000.html  https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/652983b31ac5615358f6d0831edb9b207527e746  https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/652983b31ac5615358f6d0831edb9b207527e746  https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/4602eb16ea69dca94884384659cd9cbf3e7fc139  https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/5fdba98f1f97695d4e44d49352cbf648d106141b  https://jtsb.mlit.go.jp/jtsb/aircraft/detail2.php?id=2347  https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/ja603a#2ef54a57 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates11-Feb-2025 15:35 ASN Updated [Narrative, Accident report, ] Corrections or additions? ...

Pearson Intl. (CYYZ), ON to Fort Lauderdale Exec Airport (KFXE), FL.  At approximately 12:11, while the aircraft was in climb over Cayuga, Ontario, at an altitude of approximately 23000 feet above sea level (ASL), the whole upper cowl door and most of the lower cowl door on the left engine partially detached from the nacelle, before becoming completely detached, resulting in a sudden increase in parasite drag on the left side of the aircraft. The aircraft suddenly yawed and rolled to the left, and the flight crew then lost control of the aircraft as it rapidly lost altitude. The flight crew subsequently declared an emergency by transmitting a Mayday call, and at approximately 3200 feet ASL, they regained control of the aircraft and stopped the descent. The flight crew requested a diversion to Buffalo Niagara International Airport (KBUF), New York, U.S. They subsequently burned off some of the aircraftâs fuel and followed air traffic control (ATC) guidance. Although the aircraft remained difficult to control, the crew landed on Runway 23 at KBUF at approximately 12:41, with aircraft rescue and firefighting (ARFF) emergency vehicles standing by. While the aircraft was taxiing to the ramp, a remaining portion of the lower cowl door fell off the horizontal stabilizer onto the taxiway. After the aircraft came to a stop on the apron, ARFF informed the flight crew that the remaining portion of the cowl had detached from the aircraft. In the days before the accident maintenance work was carried out at the companyâs maintenance hangar. The work performed addressed 2 reported defects, requiring the removal and reinstallation of the lower cowl doors on both the left and right engines. The accident flight was the first flight after maintenance. Findings as to causes and contributing factors 1.   During the reinstallation of the lower cowl doors, the non-sequential order in which the fasteners were tightened likely led to a slip of attention that combined with an unclear expectation on the part of both aircraft maintenance engineers about who would be securing the remaining fasteners. As a result, 6 consecutive fasteners were left unsecured. 2. The reinstallation of the left-engine cowl doors and the daily inspection were conducted and certified during the same shift and by the same aircraft maintenance engineer. Given that the cowl door reinstallation was completed as part of the maintenance work at the very end of the work shift, the daily inspection item for checking the condition and security of the engine cowl doors was not performed as a specific, separate operation. As a result, the improperly secured condition of the cowl door went unnoticed. 3. The location of the unsecured fasteners on the cowl door is not easily visible and was not typically checked during pre-flight walkarounds, and no specific guidance on how to look for unsecured fasteners on this aircraft was available to company flight crews. As a result, the unsecured fasteners went undetected by the flight crew despite their multiple walkaround inspections before the occurrence flight. 4. Because some of the fasteners were not secured, there was likely a gap between the cowl door and the nacelle that allowed air to flow inside the nacelle. The cowl doors then partially detached from the nacelle, resulting in the loss of control and rapid descent. Following this, a portion of cowl door became lodged on the horizontal stabilizer and resulted in continued difficulty to control the aircraft.

Both occupants survived the crash. The aircraft was consumed by fire.  The aircraft had been contracted by the Australian National Aerial Firefighting Centre (NAFC) and was flown to Australia in December 2022. == Contributing factors â¢ During the retardant drop downhill, the aircraft descended significantly below the operatorâs standard target drop height and airspeed and entered a high rate of descent with the engines at idle. While the engines were starting to accelerate at completion of the drop, the airspeed and thrust were insufficient to climb above a ridgeline in the exit path, which resulted in the collision with terrain. â¢ Prior to the retardant drop, the aircraft captain (pilot flying) did not detect there was rising terrain in the exit from the drop, which likely contributed to the captain allowing the aircraft to enter a low energy state during the drop. â¢ After arrival at the fireground, the aircraft captain (pilot flying) declined a âShow-Meâ run and was briefed by the Birddog pilot that it would be a downhill drop. Bomber 139 then conducted a go-around from the high ground after the first drop and was led to the target through the smoke on the second drop. These factors likely contributed to the captain not expecting or detecting the rising terrain in the exit path. â¢ The co-pilot (pilot monitoring) did not identify and announce any deviations during the retardant drop, which could have alerted the aircraft captain (pilot flying) to the low-energy state of the aircraft when it descended below the target drop height with the engines at idle. â¢ The flight crew did not brief a target retardant drop height and, contrary to published standard operating procedures, did not set it as a decision height reference on the radio altimeter. Subsequently, the co-pilot (pilot monitoring), who did not believe there was a minimum drop height, did not alert the aircraft captain (pilot flying) to the low-energy state of the aircraft.  â¢ Coulson Aviation and the relevant Western Australian Government Departments had not published a minimum retardant drop height in their respective operating procedures for large air tankers. Consequently, the co-pilot (pilot monitoring), who did not believe there was a minimum drop height, did not alert the aircraft captain (pilot flying) to a drop height deviation prior to the collision. (Safety issue) Other factors that increased risk â¢ The Coulson Aviation practice of recalculating the target retardant drop speed after a partial drop reduced the post-drop stall speed and energy-height safety margins. (Safety issue) â¢ The Coulson Aviation crew resource management practice of limiting the pilot monitoring (PM) announcements to deviations outside the target retardant drop parameter tolerances increased the risk of the aircraft entering an unrecoverable state before the PM would alert the pilot flying. (Safety issue) â¢ Australian states and territories that engage in Large Air Tanker (LAT) operations have developed their own separate standard operating procedures (SOPs) for LATs and aerial supervision assets. This can result in safety requirements being omitted or misunderstood by the different tasking agencies, such as a minimum drop height, resulting in inconsistencies in the development and application of LAT SOPs.

Kennedy International Airport, NY (JFK/KJFK)"," AAIB","Accident investigation report completed and information captured","Delta Air Lines flight DL209, a Boeing 767-332ER, suffered a contained engine failure (PW4060) on takeoff from Edinburgh Airport (EDI) and experienced airframe vibration and engine indications resulting in the aircraft diverting to Prestwick Airport. Once on stand, fuel was seen coming from the right wing and the passengers were rapidly disembarked. Conclusion During the early stages of the event flight a high-pressure turbine blade fractured through fatigue cracking. The fatigue crack was initiated by a possible combination of hot corrosion and pitting from external contamination. The detached blade caused damage to a further five blades resulting in an engine imbalance. A drain tube in the right fuel tank fractured, probably as a result of the vibrations transmitted from the out of balance engine. This resulted in fuel escaping from the right fuel tank out of a wing drain hole and igniting in flight. The flight crew landed the aircraft promptly at Prestwick. They were unaware of any flames, or the right engine running down, until after landing. The fuel coming from the wing was noticed by the ground crew as the aircraft parked near the terminal buildings. The wind was blowing the fuel towards the hot brakes and there was a risk of a fuel fire. The passengers were rapidly disembarked, and actions were taken to contain and stop the fuel leak. As a result of the vibration-driven fatigue fracture of the drain tube, the aircraft manufacturer has launched a project to identify potential reliability improvements to the design while the Federal Aviation Administration reviews the manufacturerâs finding that the risk of a catastrophic outcome from a failed drain tube is not elevated.

There were no injuries reported. The pilot stated to PNG AIC investigators that before entering the final approach, he extended full flap and maintained a speed of about 90 knots. The wind within the circuit area was calm. During the final approach, he started feeling wind gusts against the aircraft. The pilot stated that at that stage, he had passed the committal point. He therefore continued to land.  The pilot stated that immediately after touchdown, the aircraft became airborne. The aircraft settled back onto the ground again. As the aircraft continued its roll, the aircraft became airborne again. Shortly after settling onto the ground the second time, the aircraft rolled off the end of the airstrip. The aircraft subsequently impacted the embankment of a drain which runs along the edge of the airstrip. The aircraft came to rest upon impact. The pilot subsequently shut down the engine instructed the passengers to follow him out of the left cockpit door. Causes [Contributing factors]: â¢ The flight to Eliptamin from Kiunga Airport was outside the operational times recommended in the companyâs Operations Manual. â¢ The aircraft was overhead the airstrip at a height of about 3,000 ft AGL, which was higher compared to the pilotâs previous flights to Eliptamin where the altitude did not exceed 1,700 ft AGL when overhead the airstrip. â¢ The AIC believes that the overhead inspection was conducted at a far too high altitude to properly assess the surface condition of the airstrip and the wind behaviour. â¢ Excessive groundspeed on approach and touchdown due to the tailwind was attributed to the localised weather present at Eliptamin Airstrip. â¢ The pilot could not identify that there were strong winds present at Eliptamin Airstrip. â¢ The pilot lacked awareness of the windsock located at the approach end of runway 14, and the windsock located at the departure end of the runway near the parking bay, did not give the appropriate indication of the prevailing winds at Eliptamin Airstrip. â¢ The tailwind component that was experienced on final approach and touchdown was beyond the allowable limit of 10 kts as stated in the Operatorâs Manual and the Aircraft Flight Manual. â¢ The aircraft landed with excess speed which caused the aircraft to bounce off the ground upon touchdown on the threshold. The aircraft was then pushed up strip by the prevailing airstrip wind conditions, while in the air. The pilot attempted to control the aircraft and managed to get the aircraft back onto the ground, however, the aircraft bounced off the ground once more and travelled further up strip while in the air. The pilot finally got the aircraft back onto the ground, however, at that point, there was no sufficient runway available to bring the aircraft to a stop. â¢ While in the air both times following the touchdown at the threshold, the aircraft was pushed further down the runway and eventually ran out of runway length and impacted the embankment at the end of the runway. â¢ On-site investigation team observed from the amount of mud deposits on the aircraftâs wheels and airframe that the strip surface was not completely dry at the time of the accident and may have had a negative impact on the braking capacity of the aircraft during the landing roll.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIC PNG Report number: AIC 23-1002 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources: PNG AIC History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  17 October 2022 P2-HFA Helifix - PNG 0 AYKI - Kiunga non Tire failure Location  Images: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates14-Feb-2024 08:04 ASN Updated [Narrative, Accident report, Photo, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight was a regularly scheduled passenger flight from Orlando International Airport (MCO), Orlando, Florida to ORD. As a result of the turbulence, one flight attendant (FA) sustained serious injuries. The aircraft was not damaged, and the flight landed without further incident.  The flight crew reported that while on the VEECK5 arrival at flight level (FL)290, near the top of the decent, air traffic control (ATC) advised of reports of moderate turbulence between FL240 and FL190. ATC suggested the flight begin its decent early to avoid the area, and the flight crew agreed. The flight had previously been smooth, and this was the first turbulence advisory they had received from ATC.  The captain informed the cabin crew to expect moderate turbulence in about 10 minutes and advised them to prepare the cabin for landing and take their seats. The captain made an announcement for the passengers to remain seated. The seatbelt sign was on. While the cabin crew was preparing for landing, the airplane encountered severe turbulence as it descended through FL250.  FA1 reached the forward jumpseat, while FA2 and FA3 reached nearby cabin seats. All 3 had difficulty reaching their seats and trouble securing their seatbelts due to the turbulence.  FA4 was lifted up then down to the floor while attempting to reach a seat, injuring her left leg and ankle. She remained on the aisle floor until the turbulence ended, about 2 minutes after it began.  Once FA1 confirmed it was safe to get up, she informed the captain about the injury to FA4 and went to check on the passengers with FA2. FA3 tended to FA4 and made a passenger announcement requesting medical assistance. A nurse who was a passenger on board rendered aid to FA4. The captain advised dispatch of the event and requested medical personnel meet the airplane at the gate. After landing, FA4 was transported to the hospital where she was diagnosed with multiple fractures to her left leg and ankle which required surgery.  A post-accident weather analysis provided by the operator showed strong horizontal and vertical wind shear and gravity waves in the area indicating an environment conducive to clear air turbulence. Preflight weather planning predicted light to moderate turbulence between FL290 to FL360 in the area of the event. While there were no active Significant Meteorological hazards (SIGMETs) over the area of the event, a turbulence SIGMET was in effect between FL290 and FL360 for an area about 20 nautical miles southeast of the event. The Turbulence Auto-PIREP System (TAPS) had generated severe turbulence reports for altitudes between FL276 and FL244 in the hour prior to the event, and one pilot report of severe turbulence between FL200 and FL250 was issued a few minutes after the event. Probable Cause: An encounter with clear air turbulence during descent.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA23LA170 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA23LA170 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  2 September 2008 N944AN American Airlines 0 Los Angeles International Airport, CA (LAX/KLAX) non Tire failure Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates04-Apr-2024 08:04 ASN Update Bot Added 04-Apr-2024 08:52 ASN Updated [Aircraft type, Nature, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

Neither pilot reported identifying any mechanical issues with the airplane before the flight. The flight was uneventful and both pilots described the landing as being firm, with the copilot stating the landing was in the touchdown zone on the runway. The pilot reported that after landing he knew something was wrong because the left wing was low. The pilots taxied the airplane to the ramp where they discovered fuel leaking from the left wing.  A review of airport surveillance video revealed that the airplane touched down around the displaced threshold, bounced, and touched down again. Examination of the runway revealed skid marks beginning in the displaced threshold about 110 ft before the landing surface of the runway. Fractured airplane parts were scattered over and beyond the ground scars and tire markings. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed it sustained structural and skin damage to the left wing, the landing gear strut, and both left main wheels.  One passenger said that she heard altitudes called out during the landing approach, and just before touchdown, she heard a crewmember announce, âtoo fast, too fast!' She stated the airplane contacted the runway so hard the oxygen masks deployed and compartments inside the airplane opened. The airplane bounced, and the second landing was bumpy. She also stated that fuel was leaking from the airplane when they were deplaned. Although the pilots' subsequent statements indicated that they observed that the airplane's left wing was âlower' during takeoff on the accident flight, surveillance video of the airplane from the departure airport did not indicate any anomalies. Given the available evidence, it is likely that the pilots failed to attain a proper landing flare and touchdown point, which resulted in a hard landing short of the runway. Probable Cause: The pilots' failure to attain a proper landing flare and touchdown point, which resulted in a hard landing short of the runway.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA23LA126 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB ERA23LA126  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates27-Oct-2024 20:48 ASN Update Bot Updated [Time, Operator, Other fatalities, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, ]27-Oct-2024 20:58 ASN Updated [Operator, Other fatalities, Departure airport, Destination airport, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The pilot, two passengers and a dog were able to leave the plane unharmed Conclusions The weather conditions played a major role in the origin of the accident, especially the incoming rain showers and unexpected downdraft during the final approach of the aircraft. The decision to attempt landing before the rain showers arrived was made with awareness of the weather conditions. This underscores the unpredictability and need to maintain a safe distance from rain showers during landing.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Dutch Safety Board Report number: 2023036 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Dutch Safety Board  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates30-May-2024 12:00 ASN Updated [Time, Departure airport, Narrative, Accident report, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

As a result of the turbulence, all three flight attendants were injured with two receiving minor injuries and one receiving a serious injury. The aircraft continued to its destination without further incident.  According to the captain, the flight crew completed the approach checklist and illuminated the seat belt sign when the airplane was at about flight level (FL)180. As the airplane passed through 12,000 feet, the first officer (FO) made an announcement to the flight attendants to prepare the cabin for landing.  According to the lead flight attendant, she made the landing announcement to passengers while the other two flight attendants started final checks from the aft cabin. The lead flight attendant then started the final check from the front of the aircraft. When the lead flight attendant was between rows 6 and 9, the airplane descended through a cloud layer at about 7000 feet and experienced what was described as moderate turbulence by the flight crew. This turbulence led to all three flight attendants falling to the floor. All three flight attendants agreed they needed medical attention and notified the flight crew. The FO called operations and requested for paramedics to meet the airplane. The flight continued to its destination without further incident. Upon arrival at MSY, paramedics met the airplane at the gate, and all flight attendants received medical treatment.  The lead flight attendant was transported to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a fractured ankle. Another flight attendant suffered minor injuries to their back and the third suffered minor injuries to their head. Both pilots stated that the cloud layer appeared stable with no vertical development, and there were no indications on the radar that suggested the risk of turbulence. A post-accident review of the weather conditions showed no pilot reports (PIREPs) for turbulence located within a 100 nm radius from the accident location within 2 hours of the accident time. There were no airman's meteorological information (AIRMETs), significant meteorological information (SIGMETs), or Center Weather Advisories for turbulence or thunderstorm activity for the accident location. Based on weather satellite information and upper air sounding data, the flight encountered convective activity while traversing building cumulus clouds during the descent. Probable Cause: The flight's encounter with convective turbulence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA23LA175 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA23LA175  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates28-Jul-2023 17:49 ASN Update Bot Updated 28-Jul-2023 17:50 harro Updated Corrections or additions? ...

Hobby Airport, TX (HOU/KHOU)"," NTSB","Accident investigation report completed and information captured","The HondaJet sustained substantial damage in a landing accident at William P. Hobby Airport (HOU/KHOU), Houston, Texas. There were no injuries. The pilot was landing at the destination airport with a gusting crosswind. Upon touchdown, he established the aileron controls for the crosswind and applied the brakes; however, no braking action was observed. The airplane subsequently drifted left and departed the runway pavement. It came to rest upright in the grass infield area adjacent to the runway. The outboard portion of the right wing separated which resulted in substantial damage.   Data indicated that the airplane was 14 knots or more above the published landing reference speed when it crossed the runway threshold, and it touched down about 2,000 ft from the threshold. The left and right weight-on-wheels (WOW) parameters transitioned from air to ground consistent with initial touchdown; however, the left WOW parameter transitioned back to air about 2 seconds later. The right WOW parameter remained on ground until the airplane departed the runway pavement. The brake system touchdown protection is designed to prevent brake application until wheel spin-up occurs to avoid the possibility of inadvertently landing with a locked wheel due to brake application. After weight-on-wheels has been true for three seconds, power braking is enabled. It is likely that the lack of positive weight-on-wheel parameters inhibited brake application due to the touchdown protection function and resulted in the pilot not observing any braking action. The excess airspeed, extended touchdown, and transient weight-on-wheels parameters were consistent with the airplane floating during the landing flare and with the application of aileron controls for the crosswind conditions. The airplane was not equipped with wing-mounted speed brakes which would have assisted in maintaining weight-on-wheels during the initial portion of the landing. The most recent wind report, transmitted by the tower controller when the airplane was on a 3-mile final, presented a 70Â° crosswind at 15 knots, gusting to 25 knots. The corresponding crosswind gust component was about 24 knots. The airplane flight manual specified a crosswind limitation of 20 kts for takeoff and landing; therefore, the crosswind at the time of the accident exceeded the airframe crosswind limitation and would have made control during touchdown difficult.  The pilot reported that he had made two requests with the approach controller to land on a different runway, but those requests were denied. The investigation was unable to make any determination regarding a pilot request for an alternate runway. Federal Aviation Regulations stated that the pilot in command of an aircraft is directly responsible for, and is the final authority as to, the operation of that aircraft. The regulations also stated that no person may operate a civil aircraft without complying with the operating limitations. The pilot's ultimate acceptance of the runway assignment which likely exceeded the crosswind limitation of the airplane was contrary to the regulations and to the safe operation of the airplane. Probable Cause: The pilot's loss of directional control during landing which resulted in a runway excursion. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's decision to land with a crosswind that exceeded the limitation for the airplane.METAR: 16:53 UTC / 10:53 local time: KHOU 171653Z 35017G26KT 10SM BKN250 07/M04 A3047 RMK AO2 PK WND 36026/1652 SLP324 T0067104417:53 UTC / 11:53 local time: KHOU 171753Z 34017G25KT 10SM BKN250 09/M04 A3045 RMK AO2 PK WND 31026/1737 SLP315 T00891044 10089 20033 58003Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN23LA112 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources: khou.com  flightaware.com   Location  Images: Photo: FAA Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates04-Apr-2024 08:25 ASN Updated [Narrative, Accident report, ]04-Apr-2024 08:26 ASN Updated [Photo, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Approaching 10,000 ft AMSL on descent into POM, the crew actioned the Fokker 70 Normal Procedures Before Approach Check. The flight crew subsequently noticed that the Landing Elevation Setting had not been set for an arrival into POM but was instead, still maintained at about 5,500 ft, which they initially set for HGU. The crew stated to the PNG AIC that since there was a need to increase the rate of pressurizing the cabin on descent, the Fokker 70 Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) Abnormal Procedures for Manual Cabin Pressurization Control Procedure was executed, and they continued with the approach for landing at POM via the ILS procedure for runway 14L. Once the aircraft was established on final approach for runway 14L, the cabin pressure differential indicated about 6 PSI. Seeing that the indication was above the maximum allowable cabin differential for landing (0.13 PSI), the crew terminated the approach and initiated a Go Around at about 16:00, from 1,000 ft AGL straight ahead over runway 14L. The aircraft climbed on runway heading to 2,500 ft AGL and requested clearance from ATC to conduct a right hand turn to track and visually hold at 2,500 ft. ATC provided the clearance as requested by the crew. The crew reportedly actioned the QRH Abnormal Procedure for ""Reduced Cabin Pressure Differential Procedure"". The aircraft then left the hold and with ATC clearance, tracked for a right base turn at about 16:14. The crew reportedly conducted a normal approach and landed on runway 14L at 16:20.  On  disembarking  the  aircraft , a passenger of the occurrence flight alerted Air Niugini Customer Service that a few passengers from the flight were bleeding from the ears and nose. It was reported that a total of 22 persons were injured; 4 persons had serious injuries and were admitted. PNG AIC rated the occurrence a 'Serious Incident'. However, per ICAO Annex 13, this occurrence should be considered an 'Accident', given the fact that four occupants had suffered serious injuries. CAUSES [CONTRIBUTING FACTORS] There were several factors that contributed to the serious incident. Flight crew actions were influenced by the organisational, operational and environmental conditions. â¢ Organisational factors like multiple changes to flight crew roster and last-minute notification to crew resulted in task saturation and stress, that prevented crew situational awareness and good crew resource management and decision making on the day of the serious incident. This resulted in the oversight by the crew to set Port Moresby landing altitude in Mt. Hagen. â¢ Operational and environmental conditions impacted the way crew conducted their operation in Mt. Hagen and in Port Moresby. â¢ The flight crew did not complete the final step of the Fokker 70 Abnormal Procedures Manual Cabin Pressurisation Control, which was to set the Manual control lever to the âUPâ position before landing to depressurise the cabin and prevent any further pressurisation. Due to not completing the procedure, the cabin differential began to increase again on finals which led to a go-around. Some passengers and cabin crew sustained injuries during the go-around due to a rapid change in cabin pressure. The flight crew then actioned the Fokker 70 Abnormal Procedures for Reduced Cabin Differential.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIC PNG Report number: AIC 23-2001 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: AIC PNG Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates12-Sep-2024 06:55 ASN Updated [Narrative, Accident report, ]12-Sep-2024 06:59 ASN Updated [Source, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The occurrence pilot, who had recently been promoted to pilot-in-command (PIC) on the Cessna 208B aircraft, was scheduled to fly alone in daytime visual flight rules (VFR) conditions. After reviewing the weather information with his colleagues at their morning briefing, he assessed that the weather was satisfactory for the flight and noted that the winds were forecast to be gusty. A pilot who was present at the briefing but was not scheduled for flight duty that day offered to accompany him. For all flights that day, the occurrence pilot would be the PIC and occupy the left seat, and the 2nd pilot went along as an extra crew member without any assigned duties, occupying the right seat. The cargo was loaded onto the aircraft, and the 1st flight of the day departed CYQN at 10:20 and landed in CYFH at 10:55. After unloading the cargo, they departed CYFH at 11:20 and returned to CYQN at 11:56. The pilots loaded the aircraft with cargo for their second flight to CYFH. According to the load sheet, there were 3320 pounds of groceries and household goods on board. The pilots refuelled the aircraft and departed from Runway 27 at approximately 12:45. A few minutes after departure, it was reported that they made a radio call on the aerodrome traffic frequency, indicating their location and an estimated time of arrival at CYFH of 13:30. Approximately 30 minutes after the occurrence flight departed, a second Cessna 208B aircraft departed also from CYQN to CYFH, with cargo for a different customer. The flight crew encountered snow showers en route, and shortly after they arrived at CYFH at 14:00, there was a snow squall, which significantly reduced visibility. At that time, 2 customers were waiting at CYFH for their cargo, and it soon became apparent that the occurrence aircraft had not yet arrived. At approximately 14:30, WNA personnel at CYQN were informed that the occurrence aircraft had not arrived at 13:30 as expected. At 14:45, management at WNA notified the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre (JRCC), in Trenton, Ontario, that the aircraft was overdue. WNA began its own aerial search along the flight path using C-FUYC, which departed CYFH at 15:10 with 2 crew members on board, flew along the direct route of flight of the missing aircraft, and returned to CYQN at 15:46. They refuelled the aircraft and departed on another search flight at 16:20, with 2 additional pilots in the back to act as spotters. They searched along the route of flight until 18:40 and returned to CYQN. JRCC had initiated its response at 15:00, and the first tasked aircraft arrived in the search area at 17:00. The search continued over the following 4 days. The occurrence aircraft was found on 4 March 2023, 30.8 nautical miles north-northwest of CYQN along the direct track to CYFH. Both pilots were fatally injured. The aircraft was destroyed by impact forces. There was no post-crash fire. There was no emergency locator transmitter (ELT) on the occurrence aircraft because it had been removed for recertification. Findings as to causes and contributing factors 1. During the en-route portion of the flight, over a remote area, the pilot lost control of the aircraft for an unknown reason, which resulted in the collision with terrain.

Flight 1369 experienced convective turbulence during the descent from cruise altitude to land at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport (DFW). The captain stated they were briefed and were expecting a mostly smooth flight from Chicago Midway International airport to the Saint Louis area, and then anticipated a âbumpy ride' the remainder of the flight to the DFW, and those were exactly the conditions they encountered.  He said that about halfway through the flight it became rough, and they were allowed to deviate around some convective cells to get a smoother ride. Air traffic control (ATC) also gave an additional reroute to transition south of the weather and return to the same arrival transition east to DFW. The captain said that the ride became smoother, so he turned off the seat belt sign as the flight was descending on the arrival at DFW. During arrival, the flight was given a descent to flight level (FL) 240 and told to maintain 290 knots or better. It was mostly smooth, so the captain kept the seat belt sign off, but as the descent progressed, they started getting some light chop, and all of a sudden experienced âone big, unexpected bump'. The captain said he immediately turned the seat belt sign on and made a call to the flight attendants (FA) to get seated. He said the âA' FA told him that one crew member fell and hit her head and hip and was in pain and unable to get up.  The first officer (FO) stated they were instructed to descend from FL280 to FL240 and during the descent the airplane flew through a cloud that looked âlight with no apparent indications of adverse conditions', but upon entering the cloud the ride went from smooth, to light, to moderate turbulence. There had been no pilot reports (PIREPS) prior to entering the descent, and the flight attendants had been preparing the cabin for landing and were about to be seated. The FO recalled that the seat belt sign was on throughout the descent. The FO said he immediately got on the public address (PA) system and told the flight attendants to be seated, and shortly thereafter they were informed that the âD' flight attendant had been thrown around and was injured. The flight crew informed ATC of the medical event, requested priority handling, and asked for paramedics to meet the airplane at the gate. ATC declared an emergency for the flight crew. The injured flight attendant was on the galley floor and could not get up. She was assisted by another flight attendant and two passenger nurses, and the flight landed otherwise uneventfully. After landing the injured flight attendant was given medical care and diagnosed with a broken hip. Probable Cause: The flight's encounter with convective turbulence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA23LA196 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA23LA196  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates20-Jul-2024 08:32 ASN Update Bot Updated [Time, Total occupants, Other fatalities, Phase, Nature, Source, Narrative, Accident report, ]20-Jul-2024 09:03 ASN Updated [Nature, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

One passenger was fatally injured. The two airline transport pilots and two other passengers were not injured. The airplane incurred minor damage. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 personal flight. The flight crew flew the passengers to their destination the day before the accident, and were conducting the return flight the following day. During the exterior preflight inspection, the second-in-command (SIC) was interrupted by line personnel delivering ice to the airplane and inadvertently failed to remove the right side pitot probe cover. The flight crew completed the remainder of their preflight activities, boarded the passengers, and taxied for takeoff. During takeoff, the SIC observed an anomaly with his right side primary flight display (PFD) airspeed indicator and he called for the pilot-in-command (PIC) to abort the takeoff. The PIC aborted the takeoff and taxied the airplane off the runway onto a taxiway. The SIC suspected that he may have forgotten to remove the pitot probe cover, and while stopped on the taxiway with the right engine running, he exited the airplane and removed the cover. Data recovered from the airplaneâs flight data recorder (FDR) indicated that the crew aborted the takeoff 16 seconds after thrust application, and the airplane reached a maximum speed of 104 knots (kts) as indicated by the left PFD airspeed indicator. The right PFD airspeed indicator data was consistent with the pitot probe remaining covered. While on the taxiway, the PIC began troubleshooting a Crew Alerting System (CAS) cyan (blue) âRUDDER LIMITER FAULTâ advisory message. He also noticed that the flight director was stuck in a pitch mode. He conducted multiple avionics stall tests, which had cleared the message on past flights; however, he was unable to clear the advisory message. The SIC initially indicated that he would call maintenance control; however, after a short discussion with the PIC, both flight crew members agreed to continue the flight with the advisory message posted. The flight crew did not consult the airplaneâs âGo/No-Goâ guide, but if they had, they would have found that the Rudder Limiter Fault advisory message was a âNo-Goâ item, and that the Minimum Equipment List provided no relief to depart with that message displayed. During the subsequent takeoff, the SIC noticed that the airplaneâs V-speeds were no longer referenced (âbuggedâ) on the airspeed indicator, and he called the speeds from memory. When the airplane passed through about 400 ft radio altitude, an amber (yellow) caution âMACH TRIM FAILâ CAS message posted. The PIC turned the airplane on course and shortly after takeoff, turned on the autopilot (AP), after which the CAS immediately displayed an additional amber âAP STAB TRIM FAILâ caution message. During the climb to cruise altitude, the pilot disconnected the autopilot via his use of the horizontal pitch trim control wheel button. Following his trim adjustments and the resulting disconnect of the autopilot, he subsequently reengaged the autopilot two additional times. With each disengagement and reengagement, all AP-related caution messages would clear, and then reappear upon autopilot reengagement. Furthermore, during the second and third engagements, an additional âAP HOLDING NOSE DOWNâ caution message was displayed as airspeed increased in the climb. According to the cockpit voice recorder (CVR), the SIC asked if the autopilot was failing to off, or if the PIC was disengaging the autopilot. The PIC informed the SIC that he disengaged the autopilot, but during the subsequent disengagements and reengagements, he never announced to the SIC that he was turning the autopilot on or off. The SIC advised the captain to not use the autopilot during the climb, to which the PIC agreed. Shortly after receiving the amber CAS caution messages, the PIC called for the SIC to âget the checklist,â but did not call for a specific checklist by name. The flight crew then became fixated on reprogramming the V-speeds into the Flight Management System (FMS), as the SIC believed that the caution messages may have been related to a configuration problem with the V-speeds and FMS since they had cleared following the aborted takeoff. About 8 minutes after the PIC called for the checklist, the SIC located the quick reference card (QRC) and the âPRI STAB TRIM FAILâ [Primary Stabilizer Trim Failure] checklist. The SIC reported in a postaccident interview that he selected this checklist because it was the only trim failure checklist on the QRC, and it seemed to address the root cause of the problem. Although there were multiple CAS messages displayed, he did not consider using any other checklist. The SIC reported that he visually showed the PIC the checklist, and they agreed to execute the checklist. The first action item was to move the stabilizer trim switch (âSTAB TRIMâ), located on the center console, from âPRIâ (Primary) to âOFF.â The SIC read the checklist item aloud and subsequently moved the switch to off. Flight data recorder (FDR) information indicated that, as soon as the switch position was moved, the autopilot disconnected, and the airplane, which had been in a 3Â° nose-up attitude, rapidly pitched up to 11Â° in one second. The normal acceleration then rapidly rose to 4g. The PIC then pushed the control column forward with at least 90 lbs of force, the airplane pitched down to a near nose-level attitude, and the normal acceleration was reduced to -2.3g. The control column was subsequently pulled back through neutral, and the airplane rapidly pitched up to over 20Â° nose-up and more than 4g of normal acceleration. The FDR then stopped recording as the inertial g switch was triggered by the loading. As a result, the full extent of the pitch event was not recorded. The airplaneâs maneuvering load factor limitation was +2.6g. The PIC reported that, immediately before the pitch oscillations, his left hand was on the flight controls and his right hand was guarding the right side of the flight controls. He reported that he did not anticipate the airplane pitching up so rapidly, but he did expect the autopilot to disconnect upon turning the stabilizer trim switch off. Shortly after the in-flight upset, the flight crew were alerted to a passenger that had been seriously injured. The SIC exited the flight deck to check on the passenger and to provide medical attention. He subsequently informed the PIC that there was a medical emergency and that they needed to land. About 17 minutes after the in-flight upset, the flight landed at the diversion airport. Later that day, the passenger succumbed to her injuries sustained during the in-flight upset. Postaccident download of the horizontal stabilizer trim electronic control unit (HSTECU) nonvolatile memory found that, during the aborted takeoff, the speed mismatch between Air Data Computer 1 (ADC1) and ADC2 exceeded 20 kts for more than 5 seconds (due to the covered right pitot probe). This scenario resulted in key faults being recorded in the HSTECU. A review of the logic for these fault messages showed that the HSTECU latched an ""ADC1/ADC2 Miscompare,"" indicating an airspeed data mismatch between ADC1 and ADC2, resulting in the HSTECU posting the Rudder Limiter Fault advisory message. In addition, a âConfirmed Mach Validâ latched to FALSE, which resulted in the Mach Trim Failure message, and the HSTECU inhibiting the autopilot trim function of the stabilizer. The manual stab trim operated at a reduced rate of movement, but was functional. The series of faults introduced into the HSTECU following the aborted takeoff resulted in the crew receiving the âAP STAB TRIM FAILâ CAS caution message upon autopilot engagement, due to the HSTECU inhibiting the autopilot trim function of the stabilizer. With the autopilot engaged and the trim function inhibited, the autopilot subsequently alerted the flight crew to âAP HOLDING NOSE DOWN,â which was meant to alert the crew that the autopilot was on, but that the airplane was out of trim and the autopilot was holding additional load on the flight controls. According to the airplane manufacturer, the âMACH TRIM FAILâ caution message was inhibited by the airplaneâs avionics system and was not displayed to the flight crew on the CAS until the airplane was in the air (weight off wheels) and above 400 ft radio altitude. Flight testing of the accident scenario conducted after the accident, in a like make and model airplane, confirmed that the series of CAS messages likely presented in-flight were âMACH TRIM FAILâ (at 400 ft radio altitude), âAP STAB TRIM FAILâ (upon autopilot engagement), and âAP HOLDING NOSE DOWNâ (upon speed deviation from where the AP was engaged). The testing confirmed that the AP-related CAS messages would clear and then reappear upon autopilot engagement and airspeed changes. The data indicated that there was no HSTECU malfunction other than the faults related to the ADC1 and ADC2 airspeed discrepancy during the initial takeoff. Additionally, there were no faults that would have produced a âPRI STAB TRIM FAILâ CAS message. Both the AP STAB TRIM FAIL and the AP HOLDING NOSE DOWN QRH checklists provided warnings about the airplaneâs out-of-trim condition when those messages were displayed and also warned that abrupt changes in control forces may be experienced when disconnecting the autopilot. The checklists required the flight controls to be held firmly and provided a caution to minimize changes to airspeed and configuration to minimize the out-of-trim state. It is likely that the accident would have been prevented had the pilots completed one of the AP-related checklists; however, the SIC and PIC agreed to complete the PRI STAB TRIM FAIL checklist, despite the CAS not displaying this message. The crew displayed inadequate crew resource management on a number of occasions, beginning with their actions following the aborted takeoff, when they failed to recognize the âRUDDER LIMITER FAULTâ message as a No-Go item. Had the flight crew called their maintenance control as required, they would have been instructed to power down the airplane, which likely would have cleared the HSTECU faults latched during the takeoff as a result of the airspeed discrepancies between ADC1 and ADC2 due to the right pitot probe still being covered. Then, despite the SIC questioning the decision to continue the climb to cruise after receiving the cascading CAS messages, the PIC continued the flight as planned. Additionally, the PIC failed to communicate with the SIC regarding his continued use of the autopilot during the climb even after receiving a warning from the SIC to not use the autopilot and agreeing with the SICâs comments. The PICâs continued use of the autopilot likely contributed to the SICâs difficulty in selecting the correct checklist, given that the AP-related caution messages would disappear each time the autopilot was disconnected, but would reappear once reengaged. The PIC did not call for a specific checklist to address the CAS messages, and when the SIC showed the checklist to the PIC for agreement before they completed it, neither identified the chosen PRI STAB TRIM FAIL checklist as incorrect. According to the CVR transcript, shortly after regaining airplane control, both crew members acknowledged that the autopilot should not have been used during the climb. The fatally injured passengerâs seatbelt was not fastened at the time of the in-flight upset. The PIC reported that the seatbelt sign was on for the entire flight, and that his regular practice was to never turn it off. The in-flight upset occurred near 23,000 ft, about 9 minutes into the flight. It is likely that the passengers had no expectation for the seatbelt sign to be turned off at any time during the flight, given that they regularly flew with this flight crew. As a result, the passengers had to use their own judgement regarding whether it was safe to get up and move about the cabin. Had the flight crew chosen the correct QRH checklist, they would have been warned of the possible abrupt change in control force upon autopilot disengagement and could have ensured that the passengers were seated with seatbelts fastened before completing the non-normal procedure. Then, even if an in-flight upset occurred, serious injury likely could have been avoided entirely by each passenger simply being seated with their seatbelt fastened. There were no other serious injuries reported from any other occupant on board. The sequence of events that ultimately led to the accident originated with the flight crewâs failure to remove the right pitot probe cover before takeoff and their subsequent decision to depart with a No-Go CAS message. Although the message was advisory and not cautionary in nature, the airplane was indirectly alerting the flight crew to additional faults that had been introduced into the airplaneâs systems following the aborted takeoff. The crewâs continuation of the flight with an unairworthy airplane directly contributed to the subsequent series of CAS messages, which the crew mis-diagnosed during the climb, resulting in the in-flight upset and loss of airplane control. Probable Cause: The flight crewâs failure to remove the right side pitot probe cover before flight, their decision to depart with a No-Go advisory message following an aborted takeoff, and their selection of the incorrect non-normal checklist in flight, which resulted in an in-flight upset that exceeded the maneuvering load factor limitations of the airplane and resulted in fatal injuries to a passenger whose seatbelt was not fastened. Contributing to the severity of the in-flight upset were the pilot-in-commandâs (PIC) decision to continue the climb and use the autopilot while troubleshooting the non-normal situation, and the PICâs pilot-induced oscillations following the autopilot disconnecting from the out-of-trim condition. Also contributing to the accident was the crewâs inadequate crew resource management.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA23LA135 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: https://patch.com/connecticut/windsorlocks/passenger-dead-after-plane-diverts-bradley-airport  https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=106816  https://registry.faa.gov/AircraftInquiry/Search/NNumberResult?nNumberTxt=300ER  https://globe.adsbexchange.com/?icao=a31fc6&lat=42.130&lon=-72.652&zoom=10.0&showTrace=2023-03-03Ãtamp=1677876313  https://flightaware.com/live/flight/XSR300/history/20230303/1945Z/KEEN/KJYO  https://www.aircraft.com/aircraft/216129907/n300er-2013-bombardier-challenger-300  https://cdn.jetphotos.com/full/6/40430_1660050434.jpg (photo)  Location  Images: Photo: View of the forward right side of the airplane and probe covers installed (NTSB) Photo: View of the cabin area (FBI) Media:NTSB is investigating the March 3 turbulence event involving a Bombardier Challenger 300 airplane that diverted to Windsor Locks, Connecticut and resulted in fatal injuries to a passenger.â NTSB Newsroom (@NTSB_Newsroom) March 4, 2023 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates06-Dec-2024 18:11 Captain Adam Updated [Location, Source, Damage, Narrative, Accident report, Photo, ]06-Dec-2024 18:12 Captain Adam Updated [Photo, ] Corrections or additions? ...

Upon being notified of the injury, the flight crew declared an emergency and diverted to Denver, Colorado for medical assistance. The flight crew reported that before departure, the purser (lead flight attendant) was asked to have the flight attendants remain seated until the 10,000 ft signal due to weather conditions at the departure airport. After departure, airspeed fluctuations and turbulence were encountered with a smooth ride once the airplane was above a cloud layer. About 12,000 ft the captain gave the 10,000 ft signal that it was safe for the flight attendants to begin the initial service.  When the flight was about 32 miles northeast of SFO the flight crew established communication with Oakland Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) while climbing through flight level (FL) 175 [17,500 ft]. The controller advised them to expect occasional light turbulence up to FL 260 and instructed them to climb to FL350.   Shortly thereafter, as the airplane climbed through 19,000 ft, the flight encountered unexpected turbulence for about 5 seconds. The flight crew then received a call from the cabin advising them that a flight attendant had fractured her leg.  At the time of the turbulence event, one of the flight attendants was in the aft galley preparing her cart for the initial service when she felt âviolent up and down jolting turbulence'. She attempted to move towards the nearest jump seat when another âintense bump' occurred. She was thrown into the air and impacted the floor fracturing her leg.  Airmen's Meteorological Information (AIRMETs) were in effect at the time of the accident for moderate turbulence below 12,000 ft and moderate turbulence from FL220 to FL360. A convective Significant Meteorological Information (SIGMET) was issued at 1455 PDT and in effect at the time of the accident for the area with areas of thunderstorms forecast with tops to FL290. A convective SIGMET implies severe or greater turbulence, severe icing, and low-level windshear. Numerous pilot reports (PIREPs) reporting moderate or greater turbulence were issued for central California (including the accident area) within two hours of the accident time. Probable Cause: An encounter with forecast convective turbulence during climb.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA23LA213 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA23LA213  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates25-Mar-2023 19:15 harro Added 25-Jun-2023 19:42 ASN Update Bot Updated 25-Jun-2023 19:44 harro Updated Corrections or additions? ...

The flight was a regularly scheduled international passenger flight from Mexico City, Mexico to KIAH. According to the flight crew, the captain was the pilot monitoring, and the first officer (FO) was the pilot flying when they were cleared for the visual approach to runway 27 at KIAH. The airplane was in the landing configuration and on a stabilized approach at 1,000 ft. above ground level (AGL).  About 60 ft AGL the captain noticed the airspeed begin to decay and stated watch your speed. The FO subsequently pitched the nose of the airplane down and added a little thrust. About 30 ft AGL, due to a higher-than-normal rate of descent the captain commanded flare, flare, flare. The FO flared the airplane which resulted in a firm landing. As the airplane rebounded from the firm landing the spoilers deployed resulting in a nose high attitude. In an effort to correct for the nose high attitude, the captain and FO pushed forward on their respective sidesticks.  The FO stated that the ground spoiler deployment coinciding with the firm touchdown resulted in an airplane nose-up pitch attitude. As a result, the pitch attitude increased until the tail struck the runway. After the tailstrike, the remainder of the landing and landing rollout were normal with no risk of runway overrun or excursion.  The tailstrike resulted in abrasion damage over an area of about 19 feet long by 1 foot wide along the aft lower fuselage. An inspection revealed substantial damage to the aft pressure bulkhead and frames. Probable Cause: The first officer's failure to maintain the correct airspeed and pitch attitude during landing which resulted in a tailstrike.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA23LA221 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA23LA221 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  10 January 2020 N1902U United Airlines 0 New Orleans, Louisiana non Turbulence Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates26-Apr-2023 12:55 Captain Adam Added 11-Jun-2023 19:38 harro Updated 25-Jun-2023 19:42 ASN Update Bot Updated 25-Jun-2023 19:43 harro Updated Corrections or additions? ...

After the event, the airplane completed two additional flights before the damage was discovered by maintenance personnel. The flight was an on-demand international cargo flight from Willow Run Airport (YIP), Detroit, Michigan, to SLW. The flight crew stated that, upon arrival at SLW, they conducted an instrument landing system (ILS) approach to runway 17. A review of flight data recorder (FDR) data revealed that the autopilot and autothrottle were disconnected at about 1,400 ft above ground level (agl). The airplane was in a stabilized configuration on approach, with glideslope and localizer deviations of less than one dot. Airspeed varied by less than 5 knots and the sink rate was less than 1,000 feet per minute (fpm). The crew indicated that the flight was âslightly bumpyâ on final approach with small fluctuations in airspeed. They stated that it felt as though the wind had shifted or dissipated rapidly while approaching 50 feet agl resulting in a higher-than-normal sink rate. FDR data showed that near 80 ft radio altitude (RA), the aircraftâs sink rate began to increase rapidly, indicating a sudden decrease in headwind. The control column was deflected airplane nose-up (ANU) in an apparent attempt to arrest the sink rate. FDR data showed that the control column remained deflected ANU until about 30 ft RA, when the airplaneâs pitch increased to nearly 5 degrees ANU. Subsequently, an airplane nose-down (AND) column input was initiated. The airplane continued to descend at a sink rate of over 15 feet per second (fps) just before touchdown, resulting in a hard landing with a peak vertical acceleration of 3.24 gravitational force equivalent (g). The tail strike likely occurred at the touchdown point where the airplane's pitch attitude reached approximately 8 degrees, exceeding the attitude limit where the aft body of the aircraft would contact the ground once the landing gear was compressed. Based on this information, and a review of several takeoffs and landings led to the determination that the tailstrike occurred at SLW. The crew indicated that the aircraft touched down harder than normal, that the airplane did not bounce, and they did not feel as if a tail strike had occurred. During a post-flight inspection at SLW, the crew stated that they did not observe any damage to the fuselage and the tail skid assembly's tailstrike indicator was in a horizontal position (parallel to the fuselage), indicating a tail strike had not occurred, see figure 1. The trip continued from SLW to Windsor Airport (YQG), Windsor, Ontario Canada, and then to YIP. During a maintenance pre-flight inspection at YIP a day after the accident, external damage to the fuselage, missed during the flight crewâs walk-around in SLW, was discovered. Further inspection of the airplane revealed substantial damage to internal structural members of the lower fuselage. The tail skid assembly was removed from the airplane and sent to the Boeing equipment quality analysis (EQA) laboratory for examination. No mechanical anomalies were found with the unit that would have affected the tail bumper strut from properly stroking and rebounding when pressurized and installed on the airplane. Although contamination, metallic and organic, larger than the design specification was found within the unit, it could not be determined how it affected the operation of the unit. Probable Cause: The pilot's failure to adequately compensate for a wind shift while on short final approach which resulted in a higher than normal sink rate and a tailstrike.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA23LA232  https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=107036  https://flightaware.com/live/flight/N834US/history/20230324/1200Z/KYIP/MMIO  https://cdn.jetphotos.com/full/6/592086_1676198256.jpg (photo) History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  11 March 2022 N832US USA Jet Airlines 0 Niagara Falls International Airport, NY (IAG/KIAG) unk Location  Images: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates17-Apr-2023 13:16 Captain Adam Added 04-Oct-2023 21:52 Captain Adam Updated 18-Aug-2024 22:14 Captain Adam Updated [Time, Source, Narrative, Accident report, Photo, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The pilot was not injured.  The business jet was equipped with Tamarack Active Technology Load Alleviation System (ATLAS) wing extensions (via supplemental type certificate) that included winglets and wing extension-mounted aerodynamic control surfaces that automatically deployed to counteract measured structural loads. Before the airplane's descent from flight level (FL) 310, the weather was clear with no turbulence. When the airplane was descending through FL 300 for FL 270, the pilot felt 'two jolts of sudden turbulence' that he described as a negative G followed by a significant positive G twice in the span of about 1 second. The pilot noted that the airplane was yawing, and he subsequently observed that the left winglet had separated, resulting in substantial damage to the airplane. He declared an emergency and landed without further incident at a nearby airport.  Review of automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast and GPS revealed that, during the airplane's descent, its airspeed was slightly outside the airplane manufacturer's maximum operating speed (VMO/MMO) performance envelope. At the time of winglet separation, the airplane was descending about 5,300 ft per minute at 275 knots calibrated airspeed. Eleven days after the accident, the separated winglet was recovered from the Gulf of Mexico; however, the section of the left wing extension that included the aerodynamic control surface was not recovered. Metallurgical examination of the recovered components revealed overstress features and no evidence of fatigue. Additionally, systems testing of the aerodynamic control surface control units, the system computer, and the enhanced ground proximity warning system revealed no anomalies.  Because the aerodynamic control surface on the left wing extension was not recovered, the reason for the left wing extension and winglet separation could not be determined. Probable Cause: The separation of the left wing extension and winglet for reasons that could not be determined based on the available evidence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA23FA174 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB ERA23FA174  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates20-Jul-2024 08:32 ASN Update Bot Updated [Time, Operator, Other fatalities, Source, Narrative, ]20-Jul-2024 09:02 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

Following an uneventful flight, the aircraft touched down on runway 28L, in crosswind conditions, with a crab angle of approximately three degrees to the left, relative to the runway magnetic heading of 277 degrees. The aircraft tracked towards the left edge of the runway before turning back through the runway centreline and eventually coming to a stop at a runway exit on the right-hand side of the runway. During the ground roll, the aircraft nosewheels were severely damaged with one wheel and tyre departing the aircraft completely, and the other wheel being ground down to its axle, while its tyre also suffered significant abrasion and loss of material. There was damage to the airframe due to debris. There were no injuries and there was no fire. The passengers and crew disembarked the aircraft through the left rear (L2) door using mobile stairs and were taken to the terminal buildings by bus.  The aircraft was repaired and resumed regular service on 29 April 2023. Probable Cause Use of the tiller to steer the nosewheel assembly at a speed higher than that prescribed by the Aircraft Manufacturer. Contributory Cause(s): 1. Landing with a crab angle on a dry runway. 2. Aircraft tracking towards the left edge of the runway following touch down of the main landing gear. 3. A quartering tail wind which proved challenging for the handling pilot, and which increased the aircraftâs groundspeed.METAR: Weather reported about the incident time: >> EIDW 091630Z 15012KT 9999 FEW013 SCT020 BKN026 12/09 Q1009 NOSIG EIDW 091600Z 16012KT 9999 FEW014 SCT018 BKN025 12/08 Q1010 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIU Report number: 2024-012 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: https://www.flightradar24.com/data/flights/fr5542#2fd50aa6 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  3 March 2022 EI-DHH Ryanair 0 Ibiza Airport (LEIB) non Ramp, ground handling Images: Photo: AAIU Media: The damaged nose wheel on Ryanair flight #FR5542 at Dublin, that was disabled after landing, on a taxiway today pic.twitter.com/UCsBbw7AAcâ Michael Kelly (@Michaelkelly707) April 9, 2023 Ryanair flight from Liverpool (FR5542) tire blowout during landing at Dublin Airport this evening (not a nose gear collapse as some reported).

Prior to reaching waypoint PECAN, the aircraft commenced deviating to avoid an area of severe weather weather and encountered moderate to occasional severe turbulence during this period. When clear of the weather, the flight continued cruising at FL210 in the Hong Kong Flight Information Region airspace. The seat belt sign was then turned off. Shortly after, approximately 46 nautical miles to the south of Xiachuan Island on the southern coast of China, unexpected turbulence associated with an updraft was encountered for a short period. During the turbulence encounter, two cabin crewmembers and one passenger were injured. The aircraft landed at ZJHK uneventfully. There was no damage to the aircraft. The injured passenger did not request medical assistance and disembarked. The two injured cabin crewmembers were positioned back to Hong Kong as passengers. After arrival, they were taken to a hospital for a medical check-up. One of the cabin crewmembers was diagnosed with a right ankle fracture and was hospitalized for more than 48 hours.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIA Report number:  Status: Preliminary reportDuration: 4 monthsDownload report:  Preliminary report Sources: AAIA  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates28-Aug-2023 09:12 harro Added 28-Aug-2023 11:08 harro Updated Corrections or additions? ...

As a result of the turbulence, three flight attendants sustained injuries, two being serious, while one passenger sustained a minor injury. The airplane was not damaged, and the flight crew continued to MAD where they were met by emergency medical technicians (EMTs) upon landing.  The flight was a regularly scheduled passenger flight from Charlotte International Airport (CLT), Charlotte, North Carolina to MAD.  The flight crew reported having a view of lightning at about an 11 o'clock position. The onboard radar also indicated rain ahead of them. Upon confirming that the sky above them was clear of any cloud cover or weather, the flight crew requested an up to 20-mile deviation of course to avoid the weather ahead, to which air traffic control (ATC) approved. As they approached the area where the radar had previously shown that there was rain, the radar was no longer showing rain and the flight crew could see no signs of rain directly ahead of them.  The flight crew reported attempts to reference both of their personal weather apps to confirm the weather shown on the cockpit radar but was unsuccessful due to the lack of internet connection. Because of this, the flight crew concluded the weather to have passed and subsequently decided to no longer deviate from the original course. The unexpected turbulence event was experienced soon after. The flight crew reported that the turbulence was sudden and came without warning. The cabin crew reported they were preparing for arrival service into MAD when they experienced a âsudden loss in altitude' and a series of jolts. The flight and cabin crew both reported that the turbulence lasted around 30 - 40 seconds and that flight crew reported that the autopilot disengaged but did not cause a deviation in altitude of more than 200 feet.  Three flight attendants reported they were preparing the back galley for meal service when the unexpected turbulence occurred, causing all three flight attendants to be thrown in the air and âslammed' on the floor. The flight attendants also reported that a passenger was thrown in the air and hit their head. After landing, the three flight attendants were seen by EMTs, and all were taken to the local hospital for further care. The flight crew was aware of thunderstorms in the area, subsequently the seatbelt sign was on, but no announcement was made to inform passengers or cabin crew of potential turbulence.  The flight crew informed ATC about the injuries and requested EMTs to meet the airplane upon arrival. Probable Cause: An encounter with inadvertent convective turbulence during cruise flight.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA23LA252 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA23LA252  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates26-Apr-2023 12:48 Captain Adam Added 20-May-2024 16:42 ASN Updated [Location, ]20-Jul-2024 08:32 ASN Update Bot Updated [Time, Operator, Other fatalities, Country, Nature, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, ]20-Jul-2024 08:58 ASN Updated [Operator, Location, Nature, Destination airport, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

During cruise, the crew received multiple warnings, including cargo smoke, avionics smoke and cabin pressure. The crew subsequently detected thick smoke in the cockpit, donned oxygen, conducted an emergency descent and diverted the aircraft to Cobar. The post-flight inspection revealed fire damage in the vicinity of the right air cycle machine and cargo bay floor. Contributing factors â¢ It was likely that an electrical component of a control circuit board on the recirculating fan failed, resulting in an in-flight fire under the cabin floor. â¢ The smoke curtain was not fitted as required for the cargo configuration, and the flight deck door was open, which allowed smoke from the in-flight fire to enter the flight deck. â¢ The underfloor fire caused weakening of the fuselage structure, which led to a subsequent depressurisation of the aircraft during the descent. However, the depressurisation aided in the removal of enough smoke from the flight deck on approach to allow an unhindered visual approach at Cobar. â¢ Crew were not familiar with the cargo configuration and were unaware of the smoke curtain requirements and location of the cross-valve handle. â¢ The Pel-Air and Rex Saab 340 flight crew operating manuals did not include reference to the location and operation of the cross-valve handle or the operation and use of the smoke curtain. (Safety issue) â¢ Rex did not ensure its flight crews received training in the differences between passenger and freight-configured Saab 340 aircraft, prior to being scheduled to fly freight operations. (Safety issue) â¢ Saab did not include the smoke curtain fitment in pre-flight documentation for the cargo-configured Saab 340 aircraft to inform flight crew of this difference from the passenger-configured version.

The flight was a regularly scheduled domestic passenger flight from Fort Lauderdale, FL to CLT. According to the flight crew, the captain was the pilot flying, and the first officer (FO) was the pilot monitoring when they were cleared to land on runway 18L at CLT. The airplane was in the landing configuration and on a stabilized approach at 1,000 ft. above ground level (AGL). While crossing the runway's threshold the wind shifted from a 6 -7 knot headwind component to a 6â7 knot tailwind component, the airspeed began to decay, and the airplane's sink rate increased. In an effort to correct for the sink rate the captain applied back sidestick. The airplane touched down firmly and bounced, coincidentally the ground spoilers deployed which resulted in a nose high attitude. The airplane touched down a second time decelerated and taxied uneventfully to the gate.  The captain stated that the ground spoiler deployment coinciding with the bounced touchdown resulted in an airplane nose-up pitch attitude. As a result, the pitch attitude increased until the tail struck the runway. After the tailstrike, and subsequent touchdown the remainder of the landing and landing rollout were normal with no risk of runway overrun or excursion.  The tailstrike resulted in abrasion damage along the aft lower fuselage, over an area of about 14 feet long by 2 feet wide. An inspection revealed substantial damage to several frames. Probable Cause: The captain's failure to maintain the appropriate airspeed and pitch attitude during landing which resulted in a tailstrike.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA23LA278 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA23LA278  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates09-May-2023 05:49 harro Added 09-May-2023 05:50 harro Updated 25-May-2023 07:46 Captain Adam Updated 28-Jul-2023 17:37 ASN Update Bot Updated 30-Jul-2023 07:44 harro Updated Corrections or additions? ...

Seconds later, the aircrew of FENIX01 radioed that they detected an odor in the cabin. The aircrew of FENIX02 then radioed that observed white or gray colored 'smoke or gas' coming from the 'left side AFT Cabin area.' Unidentified fluid was also observed trailing the airplane. At this point the lead airplane was not maintaining heading or altitude. FENIX02 then observed flames coming from around the aft equipment door and told the aircrew of FENIX01 that they were on fire and to declare an emergency. The aircrew of FENIX01 declared an emergency and their intentions to land at San Clemente Island Naval Auxiliary Landing Field (NUC). FENIX02 then took over as lead for the formation flight and maneuvered in front of FENIX01 to lead them to the airfield. FENIX02 last observed and heard radio transmissions from FENIX01 as they descended through about 9,000 feet. FENIX01 proceeded on about a 165Â° heading until about 30 miles south of NUC, where the airplane began a left turn. FENIX01 subsequently made a series of descending turns before it impacted the water one mile offshore from San Clemente Island in about 300 ft of water.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: WPR23FA185 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: latimes.com  sgvtribune.com  flightaware.com   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

During the descent towards MOH, the latest wind report given was 060 degrees at 5 knots. Based on these wind conditions, the FMS calculated the required landing distance as 4519 feet for the predicted landing weight and flaps 45 configuration. The FMS also calculated the VREF was 125 knots. Runway length was 4920 feet. About 14:59 the aircraft touched down on runway 23. During the landing roll, the crew felt that the aircraft tilted to the right. Both pilots recalled that this might be same as several occurrences before that were caused by the right main landing gear strut being depleted. The PF used steering wheel to control the aircraft direction as advised by the PM. While controlling the aircraft direction, the PF applied brake pedals and pulled the thrust reverser levers but the thrust reverser levers would not deploy.  Both pilots attempted to decelerate the aircraft by applying the brakes, but the aircraft failed stop on the runway and overran.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSC Report number: KNKT.23.05.07.04 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: 1 monthDownload report:  Preliminary report Sources: antaranews.com  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Shortly after rotation, the Pilot Monitoring (PM) was not able to select gear-up and a âGEAR TILTâ EICAS message was triggered, followed by a âGEAR DISAGREEâ EICAS message. The aircraft proceeded to the DIK holding with the gear extended, where the crew performed the related non-normal checklists, decided to dump fuel and return to ELLX with the gear extended. In order to be cleared to dump fuel over land, the crew declared an emergency, and the aircraft was vectored to an area over Belgium for fuel dumping. At 16:51:30, after dumping approximately 40 tons of fuel at FL100, the aircraft was vectored back to ELLX for an ILS3 approach to RWY 06. At 16:59:04 the aircraft was cleared to land on RWY 06.  When the aircraft touched down at 17:00:46, the wheel truck of the RH BLG with part of the inner cylinder attached separated from the aircraft. In this process, the separated gear assembly impacted the lower part of the aft fuselage multiple times and struck the righthand horizontal stabilizer. The crew was not aware of the RH BLG separation until they were informed by the tower that the aircraft had lost part of its landing gear on touchdown with four wheels attached. The crew then immobilized the aircraft on the runway. Airport surveillance video footage showed that after becoming airborne, the RH BLG wheel truck initially rotated to a normal pitch-up position before an over-extension of the strut could be observed. The over-extension was accompanied by a vapor release. During climb out, the RH BLG wheel truck could be observed in a pitch-down position. It was found that the upper bearing carrier had failed, with the bearing and piston ring retention lands sheared off.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ATI Report number: AET/AC-2024/01 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Preliminary report Sources: www.rtl.lu  flightradar24.com History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  21 January 2010 LX-OCV Cargolux 0 Luxembourg-Findel Airport (LUX) min Runway mishap Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates06-Aug-2024 12:17 ASN Updated [Narrative, Accident report, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

On the day of the occurrence, six Learjet flight crews of the operator involved planned to take off almost at the same time from Hohn Military Airport to different missions. The airplane involved was the third to take off. Two pilots were on board of the Learjet 35A. The Pilot Flying (PF) sat in the left-hand seat and the Pilot Monitoring (PM) in the right. It was planned to fly from Hohn to Wunstorf Military Airport and conduct several instrument approaches for training purposes of the local air traffic control personnel. At the same time, the flight was to be used as proficiency check for the pilot in the left-hand seat for his type and instrument rating for Learjet 20/30. The airrcraft taxied to the runway and at 12:37, while still on taxiway C3, the take-off emergency briefing was performed with the words: ""[...] when airborne keine [no] Items ausser [except] gear below 500 ft, continue climb, in real life accelerate to V2 plus 30, Klappen [flaps] rein, slight climb weiter auf [to] [...]"". At 12:38 another Learjet received take-off clearance with simulated engine failure from the Tower. That flight crew asked over the radio if the single engine take-off was approved and the Tower once again acknowledged it. After the take-off of that Learjet, the flight crew taxied with the airplane involved on the runway to Ramp 1, turned and waited for the clearance to line up on runway 26. At 12:44, the flight crew received the instruction to roll on to runway 26 and wait. They completed the Line-up check and the Before Take-off check. They planned to take-off with flaps 8Â° and engine full thrust with N1 of 96.6%. After they had received take-off clearance at about 12:47 the airplane accelerated and took off. According to the CVR recording, after take-off the PF instructed the PM to retract the landing gear and engage the Yaw Damper. At 12:47:39, the PM responded with: ""Vorab verlierst du simuliert das rechte Triebwerk (in advance, you will lose the right engine)"", the PF acknowledged it by saying: ""Copy, gear up"". Then the thrust of the right engine reduced, the left engine maintained the set take-off thrust. At that time, indicated speed was about 160 kt, according to the FDR. At 12:47:44, the PF instructed: ""Damper on"". At 12:47:45, the PM answered ""Jawohl (yes)"", almost at the same time the PF said quietly: ""Oh shit"". At 12:47:44, the PF called out loud several times: ""Fuck"" and at 12:47:54 the PM several times ""Shit"". At 12:47:55, the last recording was the landing gear warning generated by the airplane: ""Too low"". From the PMâs announcement about the simulated engine failure at 12:47:39 until the impact, Hohn Tower transmitted traffic information regarding two Tornado aircraft in the vicinity and instructed the frequency change to Hohn Radar. Witnesses observed that the airplane performed a sort of snap roll and then crashed to the ground at the end of the runway. On impact, an explosive fireball occurred. The pilots suffered fatal injuries and the airplane was destroyed. Conclusions: The accident, loss of control of the airplane, was the result of an untimely or significantly too low rudder deflection to correct the asymmetric thrust after initiation of a simulated engine failure. The large yaw angle resulted in a stall of the vertical tail and on the wing and an uncontrolled roll of the airplane. It was not possible to determine without doubt the reason for the untimely or significantly too low rudder deflection.METAR: 10:20 UTC / 12:20 local time: ETNH 151020Z 03007KT 9999 FEW050 21/03 Q1010 BLU+BLU+10:50 UTC / 12:50 local time: ETNH 151050Z 07006KT 9999 FEW050 21/04 Q1010 BLU+BLU+Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BFU Report number: BFU23-0311-1X Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: www.ndr.de  globe.adsbexchange.com/  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates14-Jun-2024 09:53 ASN Updated [Location, Narrative, Accident report, ]14-Jun-2024 09:56 ASN Updated [Nature, Destination airport, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were no injuries to the passengers and crew onboard either airplane, and the Endeavor Air airplane received substantial damage. Endeavor Air flight 4994 was operating under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 as a regularly scheduled passenger flight, and ITA Airways flight 610 was operating under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 129 as a scheduled international passenger flight. Endeavor Air flight 4994 landed on runway 22L at JFK and proceeded on taxiway juliet, then to taxiway alpha, and then initiated a turn onto taxiway KF into the ramp area. The Endeavor Air flight crew reported being cleared to enter the Terminal 4 ramp and taxi to gate B44. Ramp control advised the flight crew to give way to traffic parking at gate B42 before parking at their assigned gate. The Endeavor Air flight crew moved forward onto taxiway KF, and the flight crew stated they pulled as far forward as they could into the ramp area but could not pull any further forward due to an airplane awaiting to park at another gate.

ITA Airways flight 610 proceeded to their gate. Post accident inspection revealed substantial damage to the right elevator and horizontal stabilizer structure of Endeavor Airâs airplane, and minor damage to the right winglet of ITA Airwaysâ airplane. Probable Cause: ITA Airways flight crew's incorrect evaluation of the clearance between their airplane and another airplane stopped on an adjoining taxiway.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA23LA114B Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: https://www.informazione.it/a/A20A1050-0608-4595-8D11-A0158B5715D6/New-York-scontro-tra-un-airbus-Ita-Airways-e-aereo-Delta-nell-aeroporto-Jfk`  https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=106534  Location  Media:Airbus Ita investe un aereo Delta a New York e si trancia un'ala.

The passengers had disembarked from the aircraft but the crew were still on board. One of the vehicles from the ground handling company reversed towards the aircraft, in order to empty the aircraftâs toilet tank. During the reversing manoeuvre, the driver stopped after hearing a series of unusual beeps. After consulting with his employer, the driver carefully continued reversing. During this manoeuvre, the platform on the back of the vehicle started to rise, of its own accord. As a consequence, a section of the railing around the platform punched a hole in the fuselage of the aircraft. The platform can only be operated from outside the vehicle.  Besides the driver, who was sat in the cab, no one was in the vicinity of the vehicle. Following a technical investigation of the vehicle and the platform by the ground handling company, together with the manufacturer, no cause was discovered for the spontaneous rising of the platform.  The Dutch Safety Board has not further investigated this occurrence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Dutch Safety Board Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: OVV  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates01-Jun-2023 17:57 harro Added Corrections or additions? ...

A little bit earlier at 06:18 LT, an international phone call in English from Germany to the Narita International Airport Information Center told about a threat with 100 kg of plastic bomb in the cargo hold of GK501.   The flight crew of GK501 was informed the threat at 07:18 LT, while flying over about 65 km north of Chubu at FL380, and decided to divert to Chubu Centrair.  No emergency were declared by the flight crew, however, the ATC provided some priority to the flight.  The Airbus made a safe landing on the runway 36 of Centrair at 07:41 LT.  At 07:44 LT, emergency evacuation using slides was carried out on the taxiway A just south of vacating from A3.  Five passengers received minor injuries of scratch during the evacuation.   The sole runway was closed until 12:15 LT.  63 commercial flights were canceled, more delays and diversions happened.   No explosive device was found by a search after the evacuation.   On 10th February, JCAB rated this occurrence as an accident since it was revealed that one of the five injured passengers had suffered a serious injury of sacral fracture by evacuation.  JTSB launched an investigation.

The captain and one of the passengers died in the accident. The aircraft operated on a round trip from Naryan-Mar Airport (NNM) to Ust-Kara Airstrip and back via Karatayka. At 13:20 the aircraft took off from Ust-Kara and headed for Karatayka. Due to bad weather conditions, the flight aborted the approach to Karatayka. The captain decided to head to the alternate, Varandey Airport.  The aircraft climbed to an altitude of 200 m, but the aircraft was only able to maintain that altitude using takeoff power. The captain then decided to perform a forced landing. By then the windows had frozen up because the window heating did not work. The aircraft descended until it struck the ground. Conclusion The aviation accident involving the An-2 aircraft RA-71165 occurred during a forced landing, which was necessitated by the inability to continue the flight due to the impact of icing on the aircraft's aerodynamic and thrust characteristics.  Contributing factors included: - The captain's failure to consider potential risks of the aircraft encountering icing conditions when making the decision to take off; - The captain's delayed decision to change the flight plan despite receiving information about deteriorating meteorological conditions at the destination, which fell below the established thresholds for VFR (Visual Flight Rules) night flights and indicated the possibility of aircraft icing; - Non-compliance with VFR rules regarding prolonged flight in actual icing conditions.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: vk.com/okrugnao  nao24.ru   Location  Images: photo (c) MAK; Karatayka; January 2023 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates15-Jul-2024 13:38 ASN Updated [Narrative, Accident report, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft crashed on the bank of Seti River and partially ended up in a deep gorge, killing all 72 on board.  The flight was operated by two captains, one captain was in the process of obtaining aerodrome familiarization for operating into Pokhara and the other captain being the instructor pilot. The captain being familiarized, who was occupying the left hand seat, was the Pilot Flying (PF) and the instructor pilot, occupying the right hand seat, was the Pilot Monitoring (PM). They had operated two sectors between Kathmandu and Pokhara earlier in the morning. The take-off, climb, cruise and descent to Pokhara was normal. During the first contact with Pokhara tower the Air Traffic Controller (ATC) assigned the runway 30 to land. At a later time, the flight crew requested and received clearance from ATC to land on runway 12. At 10:51:36, the aircraft descended from 6,500 feet and joined the downwind track for runway 12 to the north of the runway. The aircraft was visually identified by ATC during the approach. At 10:56:12, the pilots extended the flaps to the 15 degrees position and selected the landing gears lever to the down position. The take-off (TO) setting was selected on power management panel. At 10:56:27, the PF disengaged the Autopilot System (AP) at an altitude of 721 feet Above Ground Level (AGL). The PF then called for ""FLAPS 30"" at 10:56:32, and the PM replied, ""Flaps 30 and descending"". The flight data recorder (FDR) data did not record any flap movement at that time. Instead, the propeller rotation speed (Np) of both engines decreased simultaneously to less than 25% and the torque (Tq) started decreasing to 0%, which is consistent with both propellers going into the feathered condition. This was followed by a single Master Caution chime.  The flight crew then carried out the ""Before Landing Checklist"" before starting the left turn onto the base leg. During that time, the power lever angle increased from 41% to 44%. At the point, Np of both propellers were recorded as Non-Computed Data (NCD) in the FDR and the torque (Tq) of both engines were at 0%.  At 10:56:50 when the radio altitude callout for five hundred feet was annunciated, another 'click' sound was heard, likely the crew had inhibited the master caution light. The aircraft reached a maximum bank angle of 30 degrees at this altitude. The yaw damper disconnected four seconds later. The PF consulted the PM on whether to continue the left turn and the PM replied to continue the turn. Subsequently, the PF asked the PM on whether to continue descend and the PM responded it was not necessary and instructed to apply a little power. At 10:56:54, another click was heard, followed by the flaps surface movement to the 30 degrees position. When ATC gave the clearance for landing at 10:57:07, the PF mentioned twice that there was no power coming from the engines. At 10:57:11, the power levers were advanced first to 62 degrees then to the maximum power position. It was followed by a 'click' sound at 10:57:16. One second afterwards, the aircraft was at the initiation of its last turn at 368 feet AGL, the high-pressure turbine speed (Nh) of both engines increased from 73% to 77%. At 10:57:18 the PF handed over control of the aircraft to the PM and the PM (who was previously the PF) repeated again that there was no power from the engines. At 10:57:24 when the aircraft was at 311 feet AGL, the stick shaker was activated. At 10:57:26, a second sequence of stick shaker warning was activated when the aircraft banked towards the left abruptly. Thereafter, the radio altitude alert for two hundred feet was annunciated, and the cricket sound and stick shaker ceased. At 10:57:32, the aircraft impacted the ground.  The Pokhara International Airport was opened on January 1, 2023 and is located to the east-southeast of the old Pokhara Airport. The most probable cause of the accident is determined to be the inadvertent movement of both condition levers to the feathered position in flight, which resulted in feathering of both propellers and subsequent loss of thrust, leading to an aerodynamic stall and collision with terrain. The contributing factors to the accident are: 1 High workload due to operating into a new airport with surrounding terrain and the crew missing the associated flight deck and engine indications that both propellers had been feathered. 2 Human factor issues such as high workload and stress that appears to have resulted in the misidentification and selection of the propellers to the feathered position. 3 The proximity of terrain requiring a tight circuit to land on runway 12. This tight circuit was not the usual visual circuit pattern and contributed to the high workload. This tight pattern also meant that the approach did not meet the stabilised visual approach criteria. 4 Use of visual approach circuit for RWY 12 without any evaluation, validation and resolution of its threats which were highlighted by the SRM team of CAAN and advices proposed in flight procedures design report conducted by the consultant and without the development and approval of the chart by the operator and regulator respectively. 5 Lack of appropriate technical and skill based training (including simulator) to the crew and proper classroom briefings (for that flight) for the safe operation of flight at new airport for visual approach to runway 12. 6 Non-compliance with SOPs, ineffective CRM and lack of sterile cockpit discipline.METAR: 04:30 UTC / 10:15 local time: VNPR METAR 0430Z 17003KT 070V190 6000 FEW025 14/09 Q1016 NOSIG05:00 UTC / 10:45 local time: VNPR METAR 0500Z 12005KT 080V160 6000 FEW025 14/09 Q1015 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: Nepal AAIC Report number: prelim.report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: kathmandupost.com History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  17 June 2016 HS-DRD Nok Air 0 near Chumphon min Windscreen cracks or failure Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates28-Dec-2023 15:21 harro Updated [Other fatalities, Damage, Narrative, Accident report, ]13-Dec-2024 15:45 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

No personal injuries were reported.  JTSB launched an investigation as an accident.   The airport was partially covered with ice and was blown by strong gust of winds at the time of the accident.   Probable Cause: The JTSB concludes that it is certain that the probable cause of this accident was that while turning toward the Spot, the aircraft slid on the icy surface on the Spot and the PIC became unable to control the taxiing of the aircraft, thus the aircraft collided with a ground service equipment parking around the Spot, resulting in damage to the airframe. The aircraft slid on the icy surface probably because the surface conditions on the Spot had not been fully improved for the taxing of the aircraft, and its taxiing speed was not the one to cope with the surface conditions on the Spot. The surface conditions on the Spot had not been fully improved because the spray range and amount of the anti-icing agents were inappropriate, which probably contributed to it. In addition, the aircraftâs taxiing speed was not the one to cope with the surface conditions on the Spot probably because the information that would affect the taxiing of aircraft was not provided to the flight crewmembers of the aircraft from the ground.METAR: METAR (accident time 24/2245Z):  RJAA 242230Z 28015G25KT 250V320 9999 FEW030 M03/M18 Q1012 NOSIG RMK 1CU030 A2991= RJAA 242330Z 29015KT 250V310 9999 FEW030 M02/M18 Q1013 TEMPO 29020G32KT RMK 1CU030 A2994=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JTSB Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: https://www.yomiuri.co.jp/national/20230125-OYT1T50093/  https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20230125/k10013959941000.html  https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/652983b31ac5615358f6d0831edb9b207527e746  https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/652983b31ac5615358f6d0831edb9b207527e746  https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/4602eb16ea69dca94884384659cd9cbf3e7fc139  https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/5fdba98f1f97695d4e44d49352cbf648d106141b  https://jtsb.mlit.go.jp/jtsb/aircraft/detail2.php?id=2347  https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/ja603a#2ef54a57 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates11-Feb-2025 15:35 ASN Updated [Narrative, Accident report, ] Corrections or additions? ...

Pearson Intl. (CYYZ), ON to Fort Lauderdale Exec Airport (KFXE), FL.  At approximately 12:11, while the aircraft was in climb over Cayuga, Ontario, at an altitude of approximately 23000 feet above sea level (ASL), the whole upper cowl door and most of the lower cowl door on the left engine partially detached from the nacelle, before becoming completely detached, resulting in a sudden increase in parasite drag on the left side of the aircraft. The aircraft suddenly yawed and rolled to the left, and the flight crew then lost control of the aircraft as it rapidly lost altitude. The flight crew subsequently declared an emergency by transmitting a Mayday call, and at approximately 3200 feet ASL, they regained control of the aircraft and stopped the descent. The flight crew requested a diversion to Buffalo Niagara International Airport (KBUF), New York, U.S. They subsequently burned off some of the aircraftâs fuel and followed air traffic control (ATC) guidance. Although the aircraft remained difficult to control, the crew landed on Runway 23 at KBUF at approximately 12:41, with aircraft rescue and firefighting (ARFF) emergency vehicles standing by. While the aircraft was taxiing to the ramp, a remaining portion of the lower cowl door fell off the horizontal stabilizer onto the taxiway. After the aircraft came to a stop on the apron, ARFF informed the flight crew that the remaining portion of the cowl had detached from the aircraft. In the days before the accident maintenance work was carried out at the companyâs maintenance hangar. The work performed addressed 2 reported defects, requiring the removal and reinstallation of the lower cowl doors on both the left and right engines. The accident flight was the first flight after maintenance. Findings as to causes and contributing factors 1.   During the reinstallation of the lower cowl doors, the non-sequential order in which the fasteners were tightened likely led to a slip of attention that combined with an unclear expectation on the part of both aircraft maintenance engineers about who would be securing the remaining fasteners. As a result, 6 consecutive fasteners were left unsecured. 2. The reinstallation of the left-engine cowl doors and the daily inspection were conducted and certified during the same shift and by the same aircraft maintenance engineer. Given that the cowl door reinstallation was completed as part of the maintenance work at the very end of the work shift, the daily inspection item for checking the condition and security of the engine cowl doors was not performed as a specific, separate operation. As a result, the improperly secured condition of the cowl door went unnoticed. 3. The location of the unsecured fasteners on the cowl door is not easily visible and was not typically checked during pre-flight walkarounds, and no specific guidance on how to look for unsecured fasteners on this aircraft was available to company flight crews. As a result, the unsecured fasteners went undetected by the flight crew despite their multiple walkaround inspections before the occurrence flight. 4. Because some of the fasteners were not secured, there was likely a gap between the cowl door and the nacelle that allowed air to flow inside the nacelle. The cowl doors then partially detached from the nacelle, resulting in the loss of control and rapid descent. Following this, a portion of cowl door became lodged on the horizontal stabilizer and resulted in continued difficulty to control the aircraft.

The first officer was Pilot Flying on this leg. The CVR recordings indicated that the First Officerâs knowledge of the destination aerodrome and understanding of the published instrument procedure RNAV RWY 07 at MYEH was inadequate. Furthermore, the First Officer was engaged in nonessential conversation during critical phase of flight. During the approach the EGPWS aural SINKRATE alert sounded and the captain instructed the First Officer to âadd powerâ three times after observing that the approach speed was 10 knots less than the value that was calculated as the landing reference speed Vref. The aircraft then touched down hard and bounced before making a second forceful impact with the runway. The aircraft received damages to left main landing gear axle, left landing gear aft trunnion support, left wing trailing edge adjacent to aft trunnion support, left and right ventral fins. Probable Cause The AAIA has determined the probable cause of this accident to be unstablized approach for landing resulting in abnormal runway contact.

Both occupants survived the crash. The aircraft was consumed by fire.  The aircraft had been contracted by the Australian National Aerial Firefighting Centre (NAFC) and was flown to Australia in December 2022. == Contributing factors â¢ During the retardant drop downhill, the aircraft descended significantly below the operatorâs standard target drop height and airspeed and entered a high rate of descent with the engines at idle. While the engines were starting to accelerate at completion of the drop, the airspeed and thrust were insufficient to climb above a ridgeline in the exit path, which resulted in the collision with terrain. â¢ Prior to the retardant drop, the aircraft captain (pilot flying) did not detect there was rising terrain in the exit from the drop, which likely contributed to the captain allowing the aircraft to enter a low energy state during the drop. â¢ After arrival at the fireground, the aircraft captain (pilot flying) declined a âShow-Meâ run and was briefed by the Birddog pilot that it would be a downhill drop. Bomber 139 then conducted a go-around from the high ground after the first drop and was led to the target through the smoke on the second drop. These factors likely contributed to the captain not expecting or detecting the rising terrain in the exit path. â¢ The co-pilot (pilot monitoring) did not identify and announce any deviations during the retardant drop, which could have alerted the aircraft captain (pilot flying) to the low-energy state of the aircraft when it descended below the target drop height with the engines at idle. â¢ The flight crew did not brief a target retardant drop height and, contrary to published standard operating procedures, did not set it as a decision height reference on the radio altimeter. Subsequently, the co-pilot (pilot monitoring), who did not believe there was a minimum drop height, did not alert the aircraft captain (pilot flying) to the low-energy state of the aircraft.  â¢ Coulson Aviation and the relevant Western Australian Government Departments had not published a minimum retardant drop height in their respective operating procedures for large air tankers. Consequently, the co-pilot (pilot monitoring), who did not believe there was a minimum drop height, did not alert the aircraft captain (pilot flying) to a drop height deviation prior to the collision. (Safety issue) Other factors that increased risk â¢ The Coulson Aviation practice of recalculating the target retardant drop speed after a partial drop reduced the post-drop stall speed and energy-height safety margins. (Safety issue) â¢ The Coulson Aviation crew resource management practice of limiting the pilot monitoring (PM) announcements to deviations outside the target retardant drop parameter tolerances increased the risk of the aircraft entering an unrecoverable state before the PM would alert the pilot flying. (Safety issue) â¢ Australian states and territories that engage in Large Air Tanker (LAT) operations have developed their own separate standard operating procedures (SOPs) for LATs and aerial supervision assets. This can result in safety requirements being omitted or misunderstood by the different tasking agencies, such as a minimum drop height, resulting in inconsistencies in the development and application of LAT SOPs.

Kennedy International Airport, NY (JFK/KJFK)"," AAIB","Accident investigation report completed and information captured","Delta Air Lines flight DL209, a Boeing 767-332ER, suffered a contained engine failure (PW4060) on takeoff from Edinburgh Airport (EDI) and experienced airframe vibration and engine indications resulting in the aircraft diverting to Prestwick Airport. Once on stand, fuel was seen coming from the right wing and the passengers were rapidly disembarked. Conclusion During the early stages of the event flight a high-pressure turbine blade fractured through fatigue cracking. The fatigue crack was initiated by a possible combination of hot corrosion and pitting from external contamination. The detached blade caused damage to a further five blades resulting in an engine imbalance. A drain tube in the right fuel tank fractured, probably as a result of the vibrations transmitted from the out of balance engine. This resulted in fuel escaping from the right fuel tank out of a wing drain hole and igniting in flight. The flight crew landed the aircraft promptly at Prestwick. They were unaware of any flames, or the right engine running down, until after landing. The fuel coming from the wing was noticed by the ground crew as the aircraft parked near the terminal buildings. The wind was blowing the fuel towards the hot brakes and there was a risk of a fuel fire. The passengers were rapidly disembarked, and actions were taken to contain and stop the fuel leak. As a result of the vibration-driven fatigue fracture of the drain tube, the aircraft manufacturer has launched a project to identify potential reliability improvements to the design while the Federal Aviation Administration reviews the manufacturerâs finding that the risk of a catastrophic outcome from a failed drain tube is not elevated.

Causes [Contributing factors]: â¢ The flight to Eliptamin from Kiunga Airport was outside the operational times recommended in the companyâs Operations Manual. â¢ The aircraft was overhead the airstrip at a height of about 3,000 ft AGL, which was higher compared to the pilotâs previous flights to Eliptamin where the altitude did not exceed 1,700 ft AGL when overhead the airstrip. â¢ The AIC believes that the overhead inspection was conducted at a far too high altitude to properly assess the surface condition of the airstrip and the wind behaviour. â¢ Excessive groundspeed on approach and touchdown due to the tailwind was attributed to the localised weather present at Eliptamin Airstrip. â¢ The pilot could not identify that there were strong winds present at Eliptamin Airstrip. â¢ The pilot lacked awareness of the windsock located at the approach end of runway 14, and the windsock located at the departure end of the runway near the parking bay, did not give the appropriate indication of the prevailing winds at Eliptamin Airstrip. â¢ The tailwind component that was experienced on final approach and touchdown was beyond the allowable limit of 10 kts as stated in the Operatorâs Manual and the Aircraft Flight Manual. â¢ The aircraft landed with excess speed which caused the aircraft to bounce off the ground upon touchdown on the threshold. The aircraft was then pushed up strip by the prevailing airstrip wind conditions, while in the air. The pilot attempted to control the aircraft and managed to get the aircraft back onto the ground, however, the aircraft bounced off the ground once more and travelled further up strip while in the air. The pilot finally got the aircraft back onto the ground, however, at that point, there was no sufficient runway available to bring the aircraft to a stop. â¢ While in the air both times following the touchdown at the threshold, the aircraft was pushed further down the runway and eventually ran out of runway length and impacted the embankment at the end of the runway. â¢ On-site investigation team observed from the amount of mud deposits on the aircraftâs wheels and airframe that the strip surface was not completely dry at the time of the accident and may have had a negative impact on the braking capacity of the aircraft during the landing roll.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIC PNG Report number: AIC 23-1002 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources: PNG AIC History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  17 October 2022 P2-HFA Helifix - PNG 0 AYKI - Kiunga non Tire failure Location  Images: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates14-Feb-2024 08:04 ASN Updated [Narrative, Accident report, Photo, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight was a regularly scheduled passenger flight from Orlando International Airport (MCO), Orlando, Florida to ORD. As a result of the turbulence, one flight attendant (FA) sustained serious injuries. The aircraft was not damaged, and the flight landed without further incident.  The flight crew reported that while on the VEECK5 arrival at flight level (FL)290, near the top of the decent, air traffic control (ATC) advised of reports of moderate turbulence between FL240 and FL190. ATC suggested the flight begin its decent early to avoid the area, and the flight crew agreed. The flight had previously been smooth, and this was the first turbulence advisory they had received from ATC.  The captain informed the cabin crew to expect moderate turbulence in about 10 minutes and advised them to prepare the cabin for landing and take their seats. The captain made an announcement for the passengers to remain seated. The seatbelt sign was on. While the cabin crew was preparing for landing, the airplane encountered severe turbulence as it descended through FL250.  FA1 reached the forward jumpseat, while FA2 and FA3 reached nearby cabin seats. All 3 had difficulty reaching their seats and trouble securing their seatbelts due to the turbulence.  FA4 was lifted up then down to the floor while attempting to reach a seat, injuring her left leg and ankle. She remained on the aisle floor until the turbulence ended, about 2 minutes after it began.  Once FA1 confirmed it was safe to get up, she informed the captain about the injury to FA4 and went to check on the passengers with FA2. FA3 tended to FA4 and made a passenger announcement requesting medical assistance. A nurse who was a passenger on board rendered aid to FA4. The captain advised dispatch of the event and requested medical personnel meet the airplane at the gate. After landing, FA4 was transported to the hospital where she was diagnosed with multiple fractures to her left leg and ankle which required surgery.  A post-accident weather analysis provided by the operator showed strong horizontal and vertical wind shear and gravity waves in the area indicating an environment conducive to clear air turbulence. Preflight weather planning predicted light to moderate turbulence between FL290 to FL360 in the area of the event. While there were no active Significant Meteorological hazards (SIGMETs) over the area of the event, a turbulence SIGMET was in effect between FL290 and FL360 for an area about 20 nautical miles southeast of the event. The Turbulence Auto-PIREP System (TAPS) had generated severe turbulence reports for altitudes between FL276 and FL244 in the hour prior to the event, and one pilot report of severe turbulence between FL200 and FL250 was issued a few minutes after the event. Probable Cause: An encounter with clear air turbulence during descent.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA23LA170 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA23LA170 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  2 September 2008 N944AN American Airlines 0 Los Angeles International Airport, CA (LAX/KLAX) non Tire failure Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates04-Apr-2024 08:04 ASN Update Bot Added 04-Apr-2024 08:52 ASN Updated [Aircraft type, Nature, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

Neither pilot reported identifying any mechanical issues with the airplane before the flight. The flight was uneventful and both pilots described the landing as being firm, with the copilot stating the landing was in the touchdown zone on the runway. The pilot reported that after landing he knew something was wrong because the left wing was low. The pilots taxied the airplane to the ramp where they discovered fuel leaking from the left wing.  A review of airport surveillance video revealed that the airplane touched down around the displaced threshold, bounced, and touched down again. Examination of the runway revealed skid marks beginning in the displaced threshold about 110 ft before the landing surface of the runway. Fractured airplane parts were scattered over and beyond the ground scars and tire markings. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed it sustained structural and skin damage to the left wing, the landing gear strut, and both left main wheels.  One passenger said that she heard altitudes called out during the landing approach, and just before touchdown, she heard a crewmember announce, âtoo fast, too fast!' She stated the airplane contacted the runway so hard the oxygen masks deployed and compartments inside the airplane opened. The airplane bounced, and the second landing was bumpy. She also stated that fuel was leaking from the airplane when they were deplaned. Although the pilots' subsequent statements indicated that they observed that the airplane's left wing was âlower' during takeoff on the accident flight, surveillance video of the airplane from the departure airport did not indicate any anomalies. Given the available evidence, it is likely that the pilots failed to attain a proper landing flare and touchdown point, which resulted in a hard landing short of the runway. Probable Cause: The pilots' failure to attain a proper landing flare and touchdown point, which resulted in a hard landing short of the runway.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA23LA126 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB ERA23LA126  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates27-Oct-2024 20:48 ASN Update Bot Updated [Time, Operator, Other fatalities, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, ]27-Oct-2024 20:58 ASN Updated [Operator, Other fatalities, Departure airport, Destination airport, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

As a result of the turbulence, all three flight attendants were injured with two receiving minor injuries and one receiving a serious injury. The aircraft continued to its destination without further incident.  According to the captain, the flight crew completed the approach checklist and illuminated the seat belt sign when the airplane was at about flight level (FL)180. As the airplane passed through 12,000 feet, the first officer (FO) made an announcement to the flight attendants to prepare the cabin for landing.  According to the lead flight attendant, she made the landing announcement to passengers while the other two flight attendants started final checks from the aft cabin. The lead flight attendant then started the final check from the front of the aircraft. When the lead flight attendant was between rows 6 and 9, the airplane descended through a cloud layer at about 7000 feet and experienced what was described as moderate turbulence by the flight crew. This turbulence led to all three flight attendants falling to the floor. All three flight attendants agreed they needed medical attention and notified the flight crew. The FO called operations and requested for paramedics to meet the airplane. The flight continued to its destination without further incident. Upon arrival at MSY, paramedics met the airplane at the gate, and all flight attendants received medical treatment.  The lead flight attendant was transported to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a fractured ankle. Another flight attendant suffered minor injuries to their back and the third suffered minor injuries to their head. Both pilots stated that the cloud layer appeared stable with no vertical development, and there were no indications on the radar that suggested the risk of turbulence. A post-accident review of the weather conditions showed no pilot reports (PIREPs) for turbulence located within a 100 nm radius from the accident location within 2 hours of the accident time. There were no airman's meteorological information (AIRMETs), significant meteorological information (SIGMETs), or Center Weather Advisories for turbulence or thunderstorm activity for the accident location. Based on weather satellite information and upper air sounding data, the flight encountered convective activity while traversing building cumulus clouds during the descent.

Hobby Airport, TX (HOU/KHOU)"," NTSB","Accident investigation report completed and information captured","The HondaJet sustained substantial damage in a landing accident at William P. Hobby Airport (HOU/KHOU), Houston, Texas. There were no injuries. The pilot was landing at the destination airport with a gusting crosswind. Upon touchdown, he established the aileron controls for the crosswind and applied the brakes; however, no braking action was observed. The airplane subsequently drifted left and departed the runway pavement. It came to rest upright in the grass infield area adjacent to the runway. The outboard portion of the right wing separated which resulted in substantial damage.   Data indicated that the airplane was 14 knots or more above the published landing reference speed when it crossed the runway threshold, and it touched down about 2,000 ft from the threshold. The left and right weight-on-wheels (WOW) parameters transitioned from air to ground consistent with initial touchdown; however, the left WOW parameter transitioned back to air about 2 seconds later. The right WOW parameter remained on ground until the airplane departed the runway pavement. The brake system touchdown protection is designed to prevent brake application until wheel spin-up occurs to avoid the possibility of inadvertently landing with a locked wheel due to brake application. After weight-on-wheels has been true for three seconds, power braking is enabled. It is likely that the lack of positive weight-on-wheel parameters inhibited brake application due to the touchdown protection function and resulted in the pilot not observing any braking action. The excess airspeed, extended touchdown, and transient weight-on-wheels parameters were consistent with the airplane floating during the landing flare and with the application of aileron controls for the crosswind conditions. The airplane was not equipped with wing-mounted speed brakes which would have assisted in maintaining weight-on-wheels during the initial portion of the landing. The most recent wind report, transmitted by the tower controller when the airplane was on a 3-mile final, presented a 70Â° crosswind at 15 knots, gusting to 25 knots. The corresponding crosswind gust component was about 24 knots. The airplane flight manual specified a crosswind limitation of 20 kts for takeoff and landing; therefore, the crosswind at the time of the accident exceeded the airframe crosswind limitation and would have made control during touchdown difficult.  The pilot reported that he had made two requests with the approach controller to land on a different runway, but those requests were denied. The investigation was unable to make any determination regarding a pilot request for an alternate runway. Federal Aviation Regulations stated that the pilot in command of an aircraft is directly responsible for, and is the final authority as to, the operation of that aircraft. The regulations also stated that no person may operate a civil aircraft without complying with the operating limitations. The pilot's ultimate acceptance of the runway assignment which likely exceeded the crosswind limitation of the airplane was contrary to the regulations and to the safe operation of the airplane. Probable Cause: The pilot's loss of directional control during landing which resulted in a runway excursion. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's decision to land with a crosswind that exceeded the limitation for the airplane.METAR: 16:53 UTC / 10:53 local time: KHOU 171653Z 35017G26KT 10SM BKN250 07/M04 A3047 RMK AO2 PK WND 36026/1652 SLP324 T0067104417:53 UTC / 11:53 local time: KHOU 171753Z 34017G25KT 10SM BKN250 09/M04 A3045 RMK AO2 PK WND 31026/1737 SLP315 T00891044 10089 20033 58003Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN23LA112 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources: khou.com  flightaware.com   Location  Images: Photo: FAA Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates04-Apr-2024 08:25 ASN Updated [Narrative, Accident report, ]04-Apr-2024 08:26 ASN Updated [Photo, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Approaching 10,000 ft AMSL on descent into POM, the crew actioned the Fokker 70 Normal Procedures Before Approach Check. The flight crew subsequently noticed that the Landing Elevation Setting had not been set for an arrival into POM but was instead, still maintained at about 5,500 ft, which they initially set for HGU. The crew stated to the PNG AIC that since there was a need to increase the rate of pressurizing the cabin on descent, the Fokker 70 Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) Abnormal Procedures for Manual Cabin Pressurization Control Procedure was executed, and they continued with the approach for landing at POM via the ILS procedure for runway 14L. Once the aircraft was established on final approach for runway 14L, the cabin pressure differential indicated about 6 PSI. Seeing that the indication was above the maximum allowable cabin differential for landing (0.13 PSI), the crew terminated the approach and initiated a Go Around at about 16:00, from 1,000 ft AGL straight ahead over runway 14L. The aircraft climbed on runway heading to 2,500 ft AGL and requested clearance from ATC to conduct a right hand turn to track and visually hold at 2,500 ft. ATC provided the clearance as requested by the crew. The crew reportedly actioned the QRH Abnormal Procedure for ""Reduced Cabin Pressure Differential Procedure"". The aircraft then left the hold and with ATC clearance, tracked for a right base turn at about 16:14. The crew reportedly conducted a normal approach and landed on runway 14L at 16:20.  On  disembarking  the  aircraft , a passenger of the occurrence flight alerted Air Niugini Customer Service that a few passengers from the flight were bleeding from the ears and nose. It was reported that a total of 22 persons were injured; 4 persons had serious injuries and were admitted. PNG AIC rated the occurrence a 'Serious Incident'. However, per ICAO Annex 13, this occurrence should be considered an 'Accident', given the fact that four occupants had suffered serious injuries. CAUSES [CONTRIBUTING FACTORS] There were several factors that contributed to the serious incident. Flight crew actions were influenced by the organisational, operational and environmental conditions. â¢ Organisational factors like multiple changes to flight crew roster and last-minute notification to crew resulted in task saturation and stress, that prevented crew situational awareness and good crew resource management and decision making on the day of the serious incident. This resulted in the oversight by the crew to set Port Moresby landing altitude in Mt. Hagen. â¢ Operational and environmental conditions impacted the way crew conducted their operation in Mt. Hagen and in Port Moresby. â¢ The flight crew did not complete the final step of the Fokker 70 Abnormal Procedures Manual Cabin Pressurisation Control, which was to set the Manual control lever to the âUPâ position before landing to depressurise the cabin and prevent any further pressurisation. Due to not completing the procedure, the cabin differential began to increase again on finals which led to a go-around. Some passengers and cabin crew sustained injuries during the go-around due to a rapid change in cabin pressure. The flight crew then actioned the Fokker 70 Abnormal Procedures for Reduced Cabin Differential.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIC PNG Report number: AIC 23-2001 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: AIC PNG Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates12-Sep-2024 06:55 ASN Updated [Narrative, Accident report, ]12-Sep-2024 06:59 ASN Updated [Source, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The five occupants died and the aircraft was destroyed. The flight was intended to transport Consulting Toxicology and Environmental Health (CTEH) emergency workers from Little Rock, Arkansas, to Columbus, Ohio, in response to an alloy plant explosion in Bedford, Ohio. The airplane was owned and operated by CTEH. At 11:51:16, the pilot requested taxi clearance. At 11:51:33, ground air traffic control (ATC) issued clearance to the pilot to taxi to Runway 18 via taxiway Alpha. At 11:53:07, tower ATC transmitted a Low Level Wind Shear (LLWS) aadvisory alert. At 11:53:21 ground ATC transmitted another LLWS advisory alert. At 11:54:47, the pilot requested takeoff clearance from runway 18 on tower frequency. At 11:54:55, tower ATC cleared the pilot for takeoff. At 11:55:06, the pilot acknowledged the takeoff clearance. There were no other transmissions from the pilot after takeoff, and no distress calls were heard from the pilot on any frequency. A video surveillance camera, located on the ramp perpendicular to runway 18, showed the airplane takeoff from runway 18 and begin an initial climb to the south. The takeoff and initial climb appeared normal. Just as the airplane went out of sight, the camera recorded a rising plume of smoke about 1-mile south of the departure end of runway 18. Shortly after the plume of smoke, the camera appeared to shake from wind, and recorded blowing debris and heavy rain on the ramp where the camera was located.  Just before and during takeoff, the camera showed that the ramp was dry with no rain or noticeable wind. A video surveillance camera located at the 3M plant where the aircraft crashed, showed the airplane impact the ground in a right-wing-low, nose down attitude. The video also showed heavy rain and blowing debris near the impact area.METAR: 17:53 UTC / 11:53 local time: KLIT 221753Z 21019G27KT 10SM BKN048 OVC060 24/14 A2962 RMK AO2 PK WND 22036/1721 SLP028 T02390144 10250 20206 5601718:02 UTC / 12:02 local time: KLIT 221802Z 30022G40KT 2SM -RA SCT036 OVC047 19/13 A2968 RMK AO2 PK WND 30040/1759 WSHFT 1748 RAB00 PRESRR P0000 T01890128Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN23FA113 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: arkansasonline.com  nwaonline.com  thv11.com   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The occurrence pilot, who had recently been promoted to pilot-in-command (PIC) on the Cessna 208B aircraft, was scheduled to fly alone in daytime visual flight rules (VFR) conditions. After reviewing the weather information with his colleagues at their morning briefing, he assessed that the weather was satisfactory for the flight and noted that the winds were forecast to be gusty. A pilot who was present at the briefing but was not scheduled for flight duty that day offered to accompany him. For all flights that day, the occurrence pilot would be the PIC and occupy the left seat, and the 2nd pilot went along as an extra crew member without any assigned duties, occupying the right seat. The cargo was loaded onto the aircraft, and the 1st flight of the day departed CYQN at 10:20 and landed in CYFH at 10:55. After unloading the cargo, they departed CYFH at 11:20 and returned to CYQN at 11:56. The pilots loaded the aircraft with cargo for their second flight to CYFH. According to the load sheet, there were 3320 pounds of groceries and household goods on board. The pilots refuelled the aircraft and departed from Runway 27 at approximately 12:45. A few minutes after departure, it was reported that they made a radio call on the aerodrome traffic frequency, indicating their location and an estimated time of arrival at CYFH of 13:30. Approximately 30 minutes after the occurrence flight departed, a second Cessna 208B aircraft departed also from CYQN to CYFH, with cargo for a different customer. The flight crew encountered snow showers en route, and shortly after they arrived at CYFH at 14:00, there was a snow squall, which significantly reduced visibility. At that time, 2 customers were waiting at CYFH for their cargo, and it soon became apparent that the occurrence aircraft had not yet arrived. At approximately 14:30, WNA personnel at CYQN were informed that the occurrence aircraft had not arrived at 13:30 as expected. At 14:45, management at WNA notified the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre (JRCC), in Trenton, Ontario, that the aircraft was overdue. WNA began its own aerial search along the flight path using C-FUYC, which departed CYFH at 15:10 with 2 crew members on board, flew along the direct route of flight of the missing aircraft, and returned to CYQN at 15:46. They refuelled the aircraft and departed on another search flight at 16:20, with 2 additional pilots in the back to act as spotters. They searched along the route of flight until 18:40 and returned to CYQN. JRCC had initiated its response at 15:00, and the first tasked aircraft arrived in the search area at 17:00. The search continued over the following 4 days. The occurrence aircraft was found on 4 March 2023, 30.8 nautical miles north-northwest of CYQN along the direct track to CYFH. Both pilots were fatally injured. The aircraft was destroyed by impact forces. There was no post-crash fire. There was no emergency locator transmitter (ELT) on the occurrence aircraft because it had been removed for recertification. Findings as to causes and contributing factors 1. During the en-route portion of the flight, over a remote area, the pilot lost control of the aircraft for an unknown reason, which resulted in the collision with terrain.

Flight 1369 experienced convective turbulence during the descent from cruise altitude to land at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport (DFW). The captain stated they were briefed and were expecting a mostly smooth flight from Chicago Midway International airport to the Saint Louis area, and then anticipated a âbumpy ride' the remainder of the flight to the DFW, and those were exactly the conditions they encountered.  He said that about halfway through the flight it became rough, and they were allowed to deviate around some convective cells to get a smoother ride. Air traffic control (ATC) also gave an additional reroute to transition south of the weather and return to the same arrival transition east to DFW. The captain said that the ride became smoother, so he turned off the seat belt sign as the flight was descending on the arrival at DFW. During arrival, the flight was given a descent to flight level (FL) 240 and told to maintain 290 knots or better. It was mostly smooth, so the captain kept the seat belt sign off, but as the descent progressed, they started getting some light chop, and all of a sudden experienced âone big, unexpected bump'. The captain said he immediately turned the seat belt sign on and made a call to the flight attendants (FA) to get seated. He said the âA' FA told him that one crew member fell and hit her head and hip and was in pain and unable to get up.  The first officer (FO) stated they were instructed to descend from FL280 to FL240 and during the descent the airplane flew through a cloud that looked âlight with no apparent indications of adverse conditions', but upon entering the cloud the ride went from smooth, to light, to moderate turbulence. There had been no pilot reports (PIREPS) prior to entering the descent, and the flight attendants had been preparing the cabin for landing and were about to be seated. The FO recalled that the seat belt sign was on throughout the descent. The FO said he immediately got on the public address (PA) system and told the flight attendants to be seated, and shortly thereafter they were informed that the âD' flight attendant had been thrown around and was injured. The flight crew informed ATC of the medical event, requested priority handling, and asked for paramedics to meet the airplane at the gate. ATC declared an emergency for the flight crew. The injured flight attendant was on the galley floor and could not get up. She was assisted by another flight attendant and two passenger nurses, and the flight landed otherwise uneventfully. After landing the injured flight attendant was given medical care and diagnosed with a broken hip.

One passenger was fatally injured. The two airline transport pilots and two other passengers were not injured. The airplane incurred minor damage. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 personal flight. The flight crew flew the passengers to their destination the day before the accident, and were conducting the return flight the following day. During the exterior preflight inspection, the second-in-command (SIC) was interrupted by line personnel delivering ice to the airplane and inadvertently failed to remove the right side pitot probe cover. The flight crew completed the remainder of their preflight activities, boarded the passengers, and taxied for takeoff. During takeoff, the SIC observed an anomaly with his right side primary flight display (PFD) airspeed indicator and he called for the pilot-in-command (PIC) to abort the takeoff. The PIC aborted the takeoff and taxied the airplane off the runway onto a taxiway. The SIC suspected that he may have forgotten to remove the pitot probe cover, and while stopped on the taxiway with the right engine running, he exited the airplane and removed the cover. Data recovered from the airplaneâs flight data recorder (FDR) indicated that the crew aborted the takeoff 16 seconds after thrust application, and the airplane reached a maximum speed of 104 knots (kts) as indicated by the left PFD airspeed indicator. The right PFD airspeed indicator data was consistent with the pitot probe remaining covered. While on the taxiway, the PIC began troubleshooting a Crew Alerting System (CAS) cyan (blue) âRUDDER LIMITER FAULTâ advisory message. He also noticed that the flight director was stuck in a pitch mode. He conducted multiple avionics stall tests, which had cleared the message on past flights; however, he was unable to clear the advisory message. The SIC initially indicated that he would call maintenance control; however, after a short discussion with the PIC, both flight crew members agreed to continue the flight with the advisory message posted. The flight crew did not consult the airplaneâs âGo/No-Goâ guide, but if they had, they would have found that the Rudder Limiter Fault advisory message was a âNo-Goâ item, and that the Minimum Equipment List provided no relief to depart with that message displayed. During the subsequent takeoff, the SIC noticed that the airplaneâs V-speeds were no longer referenced (âbuggedâ) on the airspeed indicator, and he called the speeds from memory. When the airplane passed through about 400 ft radio altitude, an amber (yellow) caution âMACH TRIM FAILâ CAS message posted. The PIC turned the airplane on course and shortly after takeoff, turned on the autopilot (AP), after which the CAS immediately displayed an additional amber âAP STAB TRIM FAILâ caution message. During the climb to cruise altitude, the pilot disconnected the autopilot via his use of the horizontal pitch trim control wheel button. Following his trim adjustments and the resulting disconnect of the autopilot, he subsequently reengaged the autopilot two additional times. With each disengagement and reengagement, all AP-related caution messages would clear, and then reappear upon autopilot reengagement. Furthermore, during the second and third engagements, an additional âAP HOLDING NOSE DOWNâ caution message was displayed as airspeed increased in the climb. According to the cockpit voice recorder (CVR), the SIC asked if the autopilot was failing to off, or if the PIC was disengaging the autopilot. The PIC informed the SIC that he disengaged the autopilot, but during the subsequent disengagements and reengagements, he never announced to the SIC that he was turning the autopilot on or off. The SIC advised the captain to not use the autopilot during the climb, to which the PIC agreed. Shortly after receiving the amber CAS caution messages, the PIC called for the SIC to âget the checklist,â but did not call for a specific checklist by name. The flight crew then became fixated on reprogramming the V-speeds into the Flight Management System (FMS), as the SIC believed that the caution messages may have been related to a configuration problem with the V-speeds and FMS since they had cleared following the aborted takeoff. About 8 minutes after the PIC called for the checklist, the SIC located the quick reference card (QRC) and the âPRI STAB TRIM FAILâ [Primary Stabilizer Trim Failure] checklist. The SIC reported in a postaccident interview that he selected this checklist because it was the only trim failure checklist on the QRC, and it seemed to address the root cause of the problem. Although there were multiple CAS messages displayed, he did not consider using any other checklist. The SIC reported that he visually showed the PIC the checklist, and they agreed to execute the checklist. The first action item was to move the stabilizer trim switch (âSTAB TRIMâ), located on the center console, from âPRIâ (Primary) to âOFF.â The SIC read the checklist item aloud and subsequently moved the switch to off. Flight data recorder (FDR) information indicated that, as soon as the switch position was moved, the autopilot disconnected, and the airplane, which had been in a 3Â° nose-up attitude, rapidly pitched up to 11Â° in one second. The normal acceleration then rapidly rose to 4g. The PIC then pushed the control column forward with at least 90 lbs of force, the airplane pitched down to a near nose-level attitude, and the normal acceleration was reduced to -2.3g. The control column was subsequently pulled back through neutral, and the airplane rapidly pitched up to over 20Â° nose-up and more than 4g of normal acceleration. The FDR then stopped recording as the inertial g switch was triggered by the loading. As a result, the full extent of the pitch event was not recorded. The airplaneâs maneuvering load factor limitation was +2.6g. The PIC reported that, immediately before the pitch oscillations, his left hand was on the flight controls and his right hand was guarding the right side of the flight controls. He reported that he did not anticipate the airplane pitching up so rapidly, but he did expect the autopilot to disconnect upon turning the stabilizer trim switch off. Shortly after the in-flight upset, the flight crew were alerted to a passenger that had been seriously injured. The SIC exited the flight deck to check on the passenger and to provide medical attention. He subsequently informed the PIC that there was a medical emergency and that they needed to land. About 17 minutes after the in-flight upset, the flight landed at the diversion airport. Later that day, the passenger succumbed to her injuries sustained during the in-flight upset. Postaccident download of the horizontal stabilizer trim electronic control unit (HSTECU) nonvolatile memory found that, during the aborted takeoff, the speed mismatch between Air Data Computer 1 (ADC1) and ADC2 exceeded 20 kts for more than 5 seconds (due to the covered right pitot probe). This scenario resulted in key faults being recorded in the HSTECU. A review of the logic for these fault messages showed that the HSTECU latched an ""ADC1/ADC2 Miscompare,"" indicating an airspeed data mismatch between ADC1 and ADC2, resulting in the HSTECU posting the Rudder Limiter Fault advisory message. In addition, a âConfirmed Mach Validâ latched to FALSE, which resulted in the Mach Trim Failure message, and the HSTECU inhibiting the autopilot trim function of the stabilizer. The manual stab trim operated at a reduced rate of movement, but was functional. The series of faults introduced into the HSTECU following the aborted takeoff resulted in the crew receiving the âAP STAB TRIM FAILâ CAS caution message upon autopilot engagement, due to the HSTECU inhibiting the autopilot trim function of the stabilizer. With the autopilot engaged and the trim function inhibited, the autopilot subsequently alerted the flight crew to âAP HOLDING NOSE DOWN,â which was meant to alert the crew that the autopilot was on, but that the airplane was out of trim and the autopilot was holding additional load on the flight controls. According to the airplane manufacturer, the âMACH TRIM FAILâ caution message was inhibited by the airplaneâs avionics system and was not displayed to the flight crew on the CAS until the airplane was in the air (weight off wheels) and above 400 ft radio altitude. Flight testing of the accident scenario conducted after the accident, in a like make and model airplane, confirmed that the series of CAS messages likely presented in-flight were âMACH TRIM FAILâ (at 400 ft radio altitude), âAP STAB TRIM FAILâ (upon autopilot engagement), and âAP HOLDING NOSE DOWNâ (upon speed deviation from where the AP was engaged). The testing confirmed that the AP-related CAS messages would clear and then reappear upon autopilot engagement and airspeed changes. The data indicated that there was no HSTECU malfunction other than the faults related to the ADC1 and ADC2 airspeed discrepancy during the initial takeoff. Additionally, there were no faults that would have produced a âPRI STAB TRIM FAILâ CAS message. Both the AP STAB TRIM FAIL and the AP HOLDING NOSE DOWN QRH checklists provided warnings about the airplaneâs out-of-trim condition when those messages were displayed and also warned that abrupt changes in control forces may be experienced when disconnecting the autopilot. The checklists required the flight controls to be held firmly and provided a caution to minimize changes to airspeed and configuration to minimize the out-of-trim state. It is likely that the accident would have been prevented had the pilots completed one of the AP-related checklists; however, the SIC and PIC agreed to complete the PRI STAB TRIM FAIL checklist, despite the CAS not displaying this message. The crew displayed inadequate crew resource management on a number of occasions, beginning with their actions following the aborted takeoff, when they failed to recognize the âRUDDER LIMITER FAULTâ message as a No-Go item. Had the flight crew called their maintenance control as required, they would have been instructed to power down the airplane, which likely would have cleared the HSTECU faults latched during the takeoff as a result of the airspeed discrepancies between ADC1 and ADC2 due to the right pitot probe still being covered. Then, despite the SIC questioning the decision to continue the climb to cruise after receiving the cascading CAS messages, the PIC continued the flight as planned. Additionally, the PIC failed to communicate with the SIC regarding his continued use of the autopilot during the climb even after receiving a warning from the SIC to not use the autopilot and agreeing with the SICâs comments. The PICâs continued use of the autopilot likely contributed to the SICâs difficulty in selecting the correct checklist, given that the AP-related caution messages would disappear each time the autopilot was disconnected, but would reappear once reengaged. The PIC did not call for a specific checklist to address the CAS messages, and when the SIC showed the checklist to the PIC for agreement before they completed it, neither identified the chosen PRI STAB TRIM FAIL checklist as incorrect. According to the CVR transcript, shortly after regaining airplane control, both crew members acknowledged that the autopilot should not have been used during the climb. The fatally injured passengerâs seatbelt was not fastened at the time of the in-flight upset. The PIC reported that the seatbelt sign was on for the entire flight, and that his regular practice was to never turn it off. The in-flight upset occurred near 23,000 ft, about 9 minutes into the flight. It is likely that the passengers had no expectation for the seatbelt sign to be turned off at any time during the flight, given that they regularly flew with this flight crew. As a result, the passengers had to use their own judgement regarding whether it was safe to get up and move about the cabin. Had the flight crew chosen the correct QRH checklist, they would have been warned of the possible abrupt change in control force upon autopilot disengagement and could have ensured that the passengers were seated with seatbelts fastened before completing the non-normal procedure. Then, even if an in-flight upset occurred, serious injury likely could have been avoided entirely by each passenger simply being seated with their seatbelt fastened. There were no other serious injuries reported from any other occupant on board. The sequence of events that ultimately led to the accident originated with the flight crewâs failure to remove the right pitot probe cover before takeoff and their subsequent decision to depart with a No-Go CAS message. Although the message was advisory and not cautionary in nature, the airplane was indirectly alerting the flight crew to additional faults that had been introduced into the airplaneâs systems following the aborted takeoff. The crewâs continuation of the flight with an unairworthy airplane directly contributed to the subsequent series of CAS messages, which the crew mis-diagnosed during the climb, resulting in the in-flight upset and loss of airplane control. Probable Cause: The flight crewâs failure to remove the right side pitot probe cover before flight, their decision to depart with a No-Go advisory message following an aborted takeoff, and their selection of the incorrect non-normal checklist in flight, which resulted in an in-flight upset that exceeded the maneuvering load factor limitations of the airplane and resulted in fatal injuries to a passenger whose seatbelt was not fastened. Contributing to the severity of the in-flight upset were the pilot-in-commandâs (PIC) decision to continue the climb and use the autopilot while troubleshooting the non-normal situation, and the PICâs pilot-induced oscillations following the autopilot disconnecting from the out-of-trim condition. Also contributing to the accident was the crewâs inadequate crew resource management.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA23LA135 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: https://patch.com/connecticut/windsorlocks/passenger-dead-after-plane-diverts-bradley-airport  https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=106816  https://registry.faa.gov/AircraftInquiry/Search/NNumberResult?nNumberTxt=300ER  https://globe.adsbexchange.com/?icao=a31fc6&lat=42.130&lon=-72.652&zoom=10.0&showTrace=2023-03-03Ãtamp=1677876313  https://flightaware.com/live/flight/XSR300/history/20230303/1945Z/KEEN/KJYO  https://www.aircraft.com/aircraft/216129907/n300er-2013-bombardier-challenger-300  https://cdn.jetphotos.com/full/6/40430_1660050434.jpg (photo)  Location  Images: Photo: View of the forward right side of the airplane and probe covers installed (NTSB) Photo: View of the cabin area (FBI) Media:NTSB is investigating the March 3 turbulence event involving a Bombardier Challenger 300 airplane that diverted to Windsor Locks, Connecticut and resulted in fatal injuries to a passenger.â NTSB Newsroom (@NTSB_Newsroom) March 4, 2023 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates06-Dec-2024 18:11 Captain Adam Updated [Location, Source, Damage, Narrative, Accident report, Photo, ]06-Dec-2024 18:12 Captain Adam Updated [Photo, ] Corrections or additions? ...

Upon being notified of the injury, the flight crew declared an emergency and diverted to Denver, Colorado for medical assistance. The flight crew reported that before departure, the purser (lead flight attendant) was asked to have the flight attendants remain seated until the 10,000 ft signal due to weather conditions at the departure airport. After departure, airspeed fluctuations and turbulence were encountered with a smooth ride once the airplane was above a cloud layer. About 12,000 ft the captain gave the 10,000 ft signal that it was safe for the flight attendants to begin the initial service.  When the flight was about 32 miles northeast of SFO the flight crew established communication with Oakland Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) while climbing through flight level (FL) 175 [17,500 ft]. The controller advised them to expect occasional light turbulence up to FL 260 and instructed them to climb to FL350.   Shortly thereafter, as the airplane climbed through 19,000 ft, the flight encountered unexpected turbulence for about 5 seconds. The flight crew then received a call from the cabin advising them that a flight attendant had fractured her leg.  At the time of the turbulence event, one of the flight attendants was in the aft galley preparing her cart for the initial service when she felt âviolent up and down jolting turbulence'. She attempted to move towards the nearest jump seat when another âintense bump' occurred. She was thrown into the air and impacted the floor fracturing her leg.  Airmen's Meteorological Information (AIRMETs) were in effect at the time of the accident for moderate turbulence below 12,000 ft and moderate turbulence from FL220 to FL360. A convective Significant Meteorological Information (SIGMET) was issued at 1455 PDT and in effect at the time of the accident for the area with areas of thunderstorms forecast with tops to FL290. A convective SIGMET implies severe or greater turbulence, severe icing, and low-level windshear. Numerous pilot reports (PIREPs) reporting moderate or greater turbulence were issued for central California (including the accident area) within two hours of the accident time. Probable Cause: An encounter with forecast convective turbulence during climb.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA23LA213 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA23LA213  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates25-Mar-2023 19:15 harro Added 25-Jun-2023 19:42 ASN Update Bot Updated 25-Jun-2023 19:44 harro Updated Corrections or additions? ...

The flight was a regularly scheduled international passenger flight from Mexico City, Mexico to KIAH. According to the flight crew, the captain was the pilot monitoring, and the first officer (FO) was the pilot flying when they were cleared for the visual approach to runway 27 at KIAH. The airplane was in the landing configuration and on a stabilized approach at 1,000 ft. above ground level (AGL).  About 60 ft AGL the captain noticed the airspeed begin to decay and stated watch your speed. The FO subsequently pitched the nose of the airplane down and added a little thrust. About 30 ft AGL, due to a higher-than-normal rate of descent the captain commanded flare, flare, flare. The FO flared the airplane which resulted in a firm landing. As the airplane rebounded from the firm landing the spoilers deployed resulting in a nose high attitude. In an effort to correct for the nose high attitude, the captain and FO pushed forward on their respective sidesticks.  The FO stated that the ground spoiler deployment coinciding with the firm touchdown resulted in an airplane nose-up pitch attitude. As a result, the pitch attitude increased until the tail struck the runway. After the tailstrike, the remainder of the landing and landing rollout were normal with no risk of runway overrun or excursion.  The tailstrike resulted in abrasion damage over an area of about 19 feet long by 1 foot wide along the aft lower fuselage. An inspection revealed substantial damage to the aft pressure bulkhead and frames.

After the event, the airplane completed two additional flights before the damage was discovered by maintenance personnel. The flight was an on-demand international cargo flight from Willow Run Airport (YIP), Detroit, Michigan, to SLW. The flight crew stated that, upon arrival at SLW, they conducted an instrument landing system (ILS) approach to runway 17. A review of flight data recorder (FDR) data revealed that the autopilot and autothrottle were disconnected at about 1,400 ft above ground level (agl). The airplane was in a stabilized configuration on approach, with glideslope and localizer deviations of less than one dot. Airspeed varied by less than 5 knots and the sink rate was less than 1,000 feet per minute (fpm). The crew indicated that the flight was âslightly bumpyâ on final approach with small fluctuations in airspeed. They stated that it felt as though the wind had shifted or dissipated rapidly while approaching 50 feet agl resulting in a higher-than-normal sink rate. FDR data showed that near 80 ft radio altitude (RA), the aircraftâs sink rate began to increase rapidly, indicating a sudden decrease in headwind. The control column was deflected airplane nose-up (ANU) in an apparent attempt to arrest the sink rate. FDR data showed that the control column remained deflected ANU until about 30 ft RA, when the airplaneâs pitch increased to nearly 5 degrees ANU. Subsequently, an airplane nose-down (AND) column input was initiated. The airplane continued to descend at a sink rate of over 15 feet per second (fps) just before touchdown, resulting in a hard landing with a peak vertical acceleration of 3.24 gravitational force equivalent (g). The tail strike likely occurred at the touchdown point where the airplane's pitch attitude reached approximately 8 degrees, exceeding the attitude limit where the aft body of the aircraft would contact the ground once the landing gear was compressed. Based on this information, and a review of several takeoffs and landings led to the determination that the tailstrike occurred at SLW. The crew indicated that the aircraft touched down harder than normal, that the airplane did not bounce, and they did not feel as if a tail strike had occurred. During a post-flight inspection at SLW, the crew stated that they did not observe any damage to the fuselage and the tail skid assembly's tailstrike indicator was in a horizontal position (parallel to the fuselage), indicating a tail strike had not occurred, see figure 1. The trip continued from SLW to Windsor Airport (YQG), Windsor, Ontario Canada, and then to YIP. During a maintenance pre-flight inspection at YIP a day after the accident, external damage to the fuselage, missed during the flight crewâs walk-around in SLW, was discovered. Further inspection of the airplane revealed substantial damage to internal structural members of the lower fuselage. The tail skid assembly was removed from the airplane and sent to the Boeing equipment quality analysis (EQA) laboratory for examination. No mechanical anomalies were found with the unit that would have affected the tail bumper strut from properly stroking and rebounding when pressurized and installed on the airplane. Although contamination, metallic and organic, larger than the design specification was found within the unit, it could not be determined how it affected the operation of the unit.

The pilot and three passengers were not injured.  The pilot reported that he had recently completed his initial training, and the accident flight was his first flight in the airplane. The pilot entered the traffic pattern with the autopilot engaged and was told by the co-pilot to ""keep it tight."" The autopilot did not command a steep enough bank, and the pilot disconnected the autopilot in an attempt to align with the runway centerline. On final approach about 50 ft above ground level (agl), the airplane was aligned to the right of the runway centerline. The airplane landed hard, bounced multiple times, exited the runway, and impacted a runway sign. The pilot then executed a go-around and landed without further incident at OKC. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing spar. Probable Cause: The pilotÂs improper landing flare, which resulted in a hard, bounced landing, runway excursion, and subsequent collision with a runway sign. Contributing to the accident was the pilotÂs lack of experience in the airplane, the unstabilized approach, and inadequate crew resource management.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN23LA148 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: globe.adsbexchange.com/  kfor.com   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot was not injured.  The business jet was equipped with Tamarack Active Technology Load Alleviation System (ATLAS) wing extensions (via supplemental type certificate) that included winglets and wing extension-mounted aerodynamic control surfaces that automatically deployed to counteract measured structural loads. Before the airplane's descent from flight level (FL) 310, the weather was clear with no turbulence. When the airplane was descending through FL 300 for FL 270, the pilot felt 'two jolts of sudden turbulence' that he described as a negative G followed by a significant positive G twice in the span of about 1 second. The pilot noted that the airplane was yawing, and he subsequently observed that the left winglet had separated, resulting in substantial damage to the airplane. He declared an emergency and landed without further incident at a nearby airport.  Review of automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast and GPS revealed that, during the airplane's descent, its airspeed was slightly outside the airplane manufacturer's maximum operating speed (VMO/MMO) performance envelope. At the time of winglet separation, the airplane was descending about 5,300 ft per minute at 275 knots calibrated airspeed. Eleven days after the accident, the separated winglet was recovered from the Gulf of Mexico; however, the section of the left wing extension that included the aerodynamic control surface was not recovered. Metallurgical examination of the recovered components revealed overstress features and no evidence of fatigue. Additionally, systems testing of the aerodynamic control surface control units, the system computer, and the enhanced ground proximity warning system revealed no anomalies.  Because the aerodynamic control surface on the left wing extension was not recovered, the reason for the left wing extension and winglet separation could not be determined. Probable Cause: The separation of the left wing extension and winglet for reasons that could not be determined based on the available evidence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA23FA174 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB ERA23FA174  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates20-Jul-2024 08:32 ASN Update Bot Updated [Time, Operator, Other fatalities, Source, Narrative, ]20-Jul-2024 09:02 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

Following an uneventful flight, the aircraft touched down on runway 28L, in crosswind conditions, with a crab angle of approximately three degrees to the left, relative to the runway magnetic heading of 277 degrees. The aircraft tracked towards the left edge of the runway before turning back through the runway centreline and eventually coming to a stop at a runway exit on the right-hand side of the runway. During the ground roll, the aircraft nosewheels were severely damaged with one wheel and tyre departing the aircraft completely, and the other wheel being ground down to its axle, while its tyre also suffered significant abrasion and loss of material. There was damage to the airframe due to debris. There were no injuries and there was no fire. The passengers and crew disembarked the aircraft through the left rear (L2) door using mobile stairs and were taken to the terminal buildings by bus.  The aircraft was repaired and resumed regular service on 29 April 2023. Probable Cause Use of the tiller to steer the nosewheel assembly at a speed higher than that prescribed by the Aircraft Manufacturer. Contributory Cause(s): 1. Landing with a crab angle on a dry runway. 2. Aircraft tracking towards the left edge of the runway following touch down of the main landing gear. 3. A quartering tail wind which proved challenging for the handling pilot, and which increased the aircraftâs groundspeed.METAR: Weather reported about the incident time: >> EIDW 091630Z 15012KT 9999 FEW013 SCT020 BKN026 12/09 Q1009 NOSIG EIDW 091600Z 16012KT 9999 FEW014 SCT018 BKN025 12/08 Q1010 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIU Report number: 2024-012 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: https://www.flightradar24.com/data/flights/fr5542#2fd50aa6 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  3 March 2022 EI-DHH Ryanair 0 Ibiza Airport (LEIB) non Ramp, ground handling Images: Photo: AAIU Media: The damaged nose wheel on Ryanair flight #FR5542 at Dublin, that was disabled after landing, on a taxiway today pic.twitter.com/UCsBbw7AAcâ Michael Kelly (@Michaelkelly707) April 9, 2023 Ryanair flight from Liverpool (FR5542) tire blowout during landing at Dublin Airport this evening (not a nose gear collapse as some reported).

The seventeen passengers and crew were not injured.  The flight crew did not receive a down and locked indication after selecting the gear down in preparation for landing at FRS. The pilot decided to perform two flyovers, requesting visual verification of the landing gear's condition from the control tower.  The observers on the ground did not notice any abnormalities.  However, during landing rollout, the right main landing gear collapsed, causing the aircraft to slide on its right wing. This resulted in damages to the wing tip, propeller, engine, and runway lights. Subsequently, there was a runway excursion towards the right side.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: UIA Costa Rica Report number: UIA-A-05-2023 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: soy502.com  tah.de  flightaware.com History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  16 May 2021 TG-TAI Transportes AÃ©reos Guatemaltecos (TAG) Airlines 0 Juan Manuel GÃ¡lvez International Airport (RTB/MHRO) min Collision with other aircraft on apron Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates10-Jan-2024 19:01 harro Updated [Other fatalities, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

As a result of the turbulence, three flight attendants sustained injuries, two being serious, while one passenger sustained a minor injury. The airplane was not damaged, and the flight crew continued to MAD where they were met by emergency medical technicians (EMTs) upon landing.  The flight was a regularly scheduled passenger flight from Charlotte International Airport (CLT), Charlotte, North Carolina to MAD.  The flight crew reported having a view of lightning at about an 11 o'clock position. The onboard radar also indicated rain ahead of them. Upon confirming that the sky above them was clear of any cloud cover or weather, the flight crew requested an up to 20-mile deviation of course to avoid the weather ahead, to which air traffic control (ATC) approved. As they approached the area where the radar had previously shown that there was rain, the radar was no longer showing rain and the flight crew could see no signs of rain directly ahead of them.  The flight crew reported attempts to reference both of their personal weather apps to confirm the weather shown on the cockpit radar but was unsuccessful due to the lack of internet connection. Because of this, the flight crew concluded the weather to have passed and subsequently decided to no longer deviate from the original course. The unexpected turbulence event was experienced soon after. The flight crew reported that the turbulence was sudden and came without warning. The cabin crew reported they were preparing for arrival service into MAD when they experienced a âsudden loss in altitude' and a series of jolts. The flight and cabin crew both reported that the turbulence lasted around 30 - 40 seconds and that flight crew reported that the autopilot disengaged but did not cause a deviation in altitude of more than 200 feet.  Three flight attendants reported they were preparing the back galley for meal service when the unexpected turbulence occurred, causing all three flight attendants to be thrown in the air and âslammed' on the floor. The flight attendants also reported that a passenger was thrown in the air and hit their head. After landing, the three flight attendants were seen by EMTs, and all were taken to the local hospital for further care. The flight crew was aware of thunderstorms in the area, subsequently the seatbelt sign was on, but no announcement was made to inform passengers or cabin crew of potential turbulence.  The flight crew informed ATC about the injuries and requested EMTs to meet the airplane upon arrival. Probable Cause: An encounter with inadvertent convective turbulence during cruise flight.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA23LA252 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA23LA252  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates26-Apr-2023 12:48 Captain Adam Added 20-May-2024 16:42 ASN Updated [Location, ]20-Jul-2024 08:32 ASN Update Bot Updated [Time, Operator, Other fatalities, Country, Nature, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, ]20-Jul-2024 08:58 ASN Updated [Operator, Location, Nature, Destination airport, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

During cruise, the crew received multiple warnings, including cargo smoke, avionics smoke and cabin pressure. The crew subsequently detected thick smoke in the cockpit, donned oxygen, conducted an emergency descent and diverted the aircraft to Cobar. The post-flight inspection revealed fire damage in the vicinity of the right air cycle machine and cargo bay floor. Contributing factors â¢ It was likely that an electrical component of a control circuit board on the recirculating fan failed, resulting in an in-flight fire under the cabin floor. â¢ The smoke curtain was not fitted as required for the cargo configuration, and the flight deck door was open, which allowed smoke from the in-flight fire to enter the flight deck. â¢ The underfloor fire caused weakening of the fuselage structure, which led to a subsequent depressurisation of the aircraft during the descent. However, the depressurisation aided in the removal of enough smoke from the flight deck on approach to allow an unhindered visual approach at Cobar. â¢ Crew were not familiar with the cargo configuration and were unaware of the smoke curtain requirements and location of the cross-valve handle. â¢ The Pel-Air and Rex Saab 340 flight crew operating manuals did not include reference to the location and operation of the cross-valve handle or the operation and use of the smoke curtain. (Safety issue) â¢ Rex did not ensure its flight crews received training in the differences between passenger and freight-configured Saab 340 aircraft, prior to being scheduled to fly freight operations. (Safety issue) â¢ Saab did not include the smoke curtain fitment in pre-flight documentation for the cargo-configured Saab 340 aircraft to inform flight crew of this difference from the passenger-configured version.

According to the flight crew, the captain was the pilot flying, and the first officer (FO) was the pilot monitoring when they were cleared to land on runway 18L at CLT. The airplane was in the landing configuration and on a stabilized approach at 1,000 ft. above ground level (AGL). While crossing the runway's threshold the wind shifted from a 6 -7 knot headwind component to a 6â7 knot tailwind component, the airspeed began to decay, and the airplane's sink rate increased. In an effort to correct for the sink rate the captain applied back sidestick. The airplane touched down firmly and bounced, coincidentally the ground spoilers deployed which resulted in a nose high attitude. The airplane touched down a second time decelerated and taxied uneventfully to the gate.  The captain stated that the ground spoiler deployment coinciding with the bounced touchdown resulted in an airplane nose-up pitch attitude. As a result, the pitch attitude increased until the tail struck the runway. After the tailstrike, and subsequent touchdown the remainder of the landing and landing rollout were normal with no risk of runway overrun or excursion.  The tailstrike resulted in abrasion damage along the aft lower fuselage, over an area of about 14 feet long by 2 feet wide. An inspection revealed substantial damage to several frames. Probable Cause: The captain's failure to maintain the appropriate airspeed and pitch attitude during landing which resulted in a tailstrike.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA23LA278 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA23LA278  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates09-May-2023 05:49 harro Added 09-May-2023 05:50 harro Updated 25-May-2023 07:46 Captain Adam Updated 28-Jul-2023 17:37 ASN Update Bot Updated 30-Jul-2023 07:44 harro Updated Corrections or additions? ...

The three occupants were killed. The airplane departed Point Mugu Naval Air Station (NTD) at 07:23 as the lead airplane in formation with a second Learjet airplane utilizing the callsigns FENIX01 (N56PA) and FENIX02 (N544PA). The flight proceeded south towards San Clemente Island with the FENIX02 flying in close formation with FENIX01. The purpose of the flight was to participate in training exercises with the United States Navy in Warning Area 291 (W291). There were three civilian crewmembers onboard each airplane. Shortly after entering W291, at 15,000 ft mean sea level (MSL), the aircrew of FENIX02 observed the lead airplaneÂs flaps partially deploy. They notified the lead airplane, who acknowledged the radio call. The aircrew of FENIX02 then observed the flaps retract. Seconds later, the aircrew of FENIX01 radioed that they detected an odor in the cabin. The aircrew of FENIX02 then radioed that observed white or gray colored 'smoke or gas' coming from the 'left side AFT Cabin area.' Unidentified fluid was also observed trailing the airplane. At this point the lead airplane was not maintaining heading or altitude. FENIX02 then observed flames coming from around the aft equipment door and told the aircrew of FENIX01 that they were on fire and to declare an emergency. The aircrew of FENIX01 declared an emergency and their intentions to land at San Clemente Island Naval Auxiliary Landing Field (NUC). FENIX02 then took over as lead for the formation flight and maneuvered in front of FENIX01 to lead them to the airfield. FENIX02 last observed and heard radio transmissions from FENIX01 as they descended through about 9,000 feet. FENIX01 proceeded on about a 165Â° heading until about 30 miles south of NUC, where the airplane began a left turn. FENIX01 subsequently made a series of descending turns before it impacted the water one mile offshore from San Clemente Island in about 300 ft of water.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: WPR23FA185 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: latimes.com  sgvtribune.com  flightaware.com   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft proceeded to the DIK holding with the gear extended, where the crew performed the related non-normal checklists, decided to dump fuel and return to ELLX with the gear extended. In order to be cleared to dump fuel over land, the crew declared an emergency, and the aircraft was vectored to an area over Belgium for fuel dumping. At 16:51:30, after dumping approximately 40 tons of fuel at FL100, the aircraft was vectored back to ELLX for an ILS3 approach to RWY 06. At 16:59:04 the aircraft was cleared to land on RWY 06.

In this process, the separated gear assembly impacted the lower part of the aft fuselage multiple times and struck the righthand horizontal stabilizer. The crew was not aware of the RH BLG separation until they were informed by the tower that the aircraft had lost part of its landing gear on touchdown with four wheels attached. The crew then immobilized the aircraft on the runway. Airport surveillance video footage showed that after becoming airborne, the RH BLG wheel truck initially rotated to a normal pitch-up position before an over-extension of the strut could be observed. The over-extension was accompanied by a vapor release. During climb out, the RH BLG wheel truck could be observed in a pitch-down position. It was found that the upper bearing carrier had failed, with the bearing and piston ring retention lands sheared off.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ATI Report number: AET/AC-2024/01 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Preliminary report Sources: www.rtl.lu  flightradar24.com History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  21 January 2010 LX-OCV Cargolux 0 Luxembourg-Findel Airport (LUX) min Runway mishap Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates06-Aug-2024 12:17 ASN Updated [Narrative, Accident report, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

On the day of the occurrence, six Learjet flight crews of the operator involved planned to take off almost at the same time from Hohn Military Airport to different missions. The airplane involved was the third to take off. Two pilots were on board of the Learjet 35A. The Pilot Flying (PF) sat in the left-hand seat and the Pilot Monitoring (PM) in the right. It was planned to fly from Hohn to Wunstorf Military Airport and conduct several instrument approaches for training purposes of the local air traffic control personnel. At the same time, the flight was to be used as proficiency check for the pilot in the left-hand seat for his type and instrument rating for Learjet 20/30. The airrcraft taxied to the runway and at 12:37, while still on taxiway C3, the take-off emergency briefing was performed with the words: ""[...] when airborne keine [no] Items ausser [except] gear below 500 ft, continue climb, in real life accelerate to V2 plus 30, Klappen [flaps] rein, slight climb weiter auf [to] [...]"". At 12:38 another Learjet received take-off clearance with simulated engine failure from the Tower. That flight crew asked over the radio if the single engine take-off was approved and the Tower once again acknowledged it. After the take-off of that Learjet, the flight crew taxied with the airplane involved on the runway to Ramp 1, turned and waited for the clearance to line up on runway 26. At 12:44, the flight crew received the instruction to roll on to runway 26 and wait. They completed the Line-up check and the Before Take-off check. They planned to take-off with flaps 8Â° and engine full thrust with N1 of 96.6%. After they had received take-off clearance at about 12:47 the airplane accelerated and took off. According to the CVR recording, after take-off the PF instructed the PM to retract the landing gear and engage the Yaw Damper. At 12:47:39, the PM responded with: ""Vorab verlierst du simuliert das rechte Triebwerk (in advance, you will lose the right engine)"", the PF acknowledged it by saying: ""Copy, gear up"". Then the thrust of the right engine reduced, the left engine maintained the set take-off thrust. At that time, indicated speed was about 160 kt, according to the FDR. At 12:47:44, the PF instructed: ""Damper on"". At 12:47:45, the PM answered ""Jawohl (yes)"", almost at the same time the PF said quietly: ""Oh shit"". At 12:47:44, the PF called out loud several times: ""Fuck"" and at 12:47:54 the PM several times ""Shit"". At 12:47:55, the last recording was the landing gear warning generated by the airplane: ""Too low"". From the PMâs announcement about the simulated engine failure at 12:47:39 until the impact, Hohn Tower transmitted traffic information regarding two Tornado aircraft in the vicinity and instructed the frequency change to Hohn Radar. Witnesses observed that the airplane performed a sort of snap roll and then crashed to the ground at the end of the runway. On impact, an explosive fireball occurred. The pilots suffered fatal injuries and the airplane was destroyed. Conclusions: The accident, loss of control of the airplane, was the result of an untimely or significantly too low rudder deflection to correct the asymmetric thrust after initiation of a simulated engine failure. The large yaw angle resulted in a stall of the vertical tail and on the wing and an uncontrolled roll of the airplane.

The airplane landed on runway 28L at PDX without further incident, and all occupants (2 flight crewmembers, 4 cabin crewmembers, and 171 passengers) deplaned at the gate. Seven passengers and one flight attendant received minor injuries. The flight was operated under Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 121 as a scheduled domestic passenger flight from PDX to Ontario, California (ONT). âââ â The separation of the MED plug from the airplane adversely affected the pressurization performance of the airplane and the damage to the MED plug adversely affected its structural strength, requiring replacement of the MED plug, resulting in a classification of substantial damage in accordance with Title 49 CFR Part 830. Both flight crewmembers held airline transport pilot (ATP) certificates. The captain had accumulated about 12,700 hours of flight experience, of which about 6,500 were in the accident airplane make and model. The first officer (FO) had accumulated about 8,300 hours total flight experience, of which about 1,500 were in the accident airplane make and model. The captain was the pilot flying and the FO was the pilot monitoring. The flight crew stated that the preflight inspection, engine start, taxi, takeoff, and departure climb were unremarkable. After takeoff, the flight crew checked in with Seattle Air Route Traffic Control Center and was cleared to flight level (FL)230 [23,000 feet]. The captain said that, while climbing through about 16,000 ft, there was a loud bang. The flight crew said their ears popped, and the captain said his head was pushed into the heads-up display (HUD) and his headset was pushed up, nearly falling off his head. The FO said her headset was completely removed due to the rapid outflow of air from the flight deck. Both flight crew said they immediately donned their oxygen masks. They added that the flight deck door was blown open and that it was very noisy and difficult to communicate. The flight crew immediately contacted air traffic control (ATC), declared an emergency, and requested a lower altitude. The flight was assigned 10,000 ft. The captain said he then requested the rapid decompression checklist, and the FO executed the required checklist from the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH). As the FO completed the checklist, the captain flew the airplane as they coordinated with ATC to return to the PDX airport. The flight landed on runway 28L without further incident and taxied to the gate. The CVR and FDR were removed from the airplane and brought to the NTSBâs Vehicle Recorder Laboratory in Washington, DC, for download of the data. The accident airplane was required to be equipped with a CVR that retained, at minimum, the last 2 hours of audio information, including flight crew communications and other sounds inside the cockpit. A CVR starts recording when the aircraft is powered on and will continue to record until the aircraft is powered down or the CVR is deactivated, either by a loss of electrical power after a major event or by manually deactivating the CVRâs circuit breaker after a less severe event. The CVR was downloaded successfully; however, it was determined that the audio from the accident flight had been overwritten. The CVR circuit breaker had not been manually deactivated after the airplane landed following the accident in time to preserve the accident flight recording. The accident airplane was required to be equipped with an FDR that recorded, at a minimum, 91 parameters and 25 hours of data. The accident airplaneâs FDR was successfully downloaded and had about 1800 parameters and was 68 hours in length. It contained 16.5 flights, and the oldest recorded flight was from December 30, 2023. A summary of the FDR data is as follows: o 17:06:47 PST: The airplane departed runway 28L at PDX. o 17:12:33 PST: The recorded cabin pressure dropped from 14.09 to 11.64 pounds per square inch (psi) when the airplane was at an altitude of about 14,830 ft and speed of 271 knots (kts). The âCabin Altitude Greater than (>) 10k ft Warningâ activated. Differential pressure was at 5.7 psi and rapidly decreased to 0 psi over the next few seconds o 17:12:34 PST: The Master Caution activated. The cabin pressure dropped to 9.08 psi at approximately 14,850 ft and 271 kts. The airplane magnetic heading was 123Â°. o 17:12:52 PST: The Master Caution deactivated. o 17:13:41 PST: The airplane continued to climb and reached a maximum altitude of 16,320 ft and began to descend. The airspeed was 276 kts on a magnetic heading of 120Â°. o 17:13:56 PST: The Selected Altitude changed from 23,000 ft to 10,000 ft. o 17:14:35 PST: The Master Caution activated for 3 seconds. o 17:16:56 PST: The airplane began a left turn from 121Â°. The altitude was approximately 10,120 ft. o 17:17:00 PST: The airplane descended below 10,000 ft. o 17:18:05 PST: The airplane altitude was approximately 9,050 ft and the airspeed was 271 kts. The âCabin Altitude Greater than (>) 10k ft Warningâ deactivated. The cabin pressure was 10.48 psi. o 17:26:46 PST: The airplane landed on runway 28L at PDX.  The airplane was equipped with a MED plug option, which Alaska Airlines had selected based on its desired seating configuration. Benefits afforded by the plug option include: 1. More passenger comfort because of the lower density of passengers and thus passengers having more space. 2. Reduced weight (63 lbs vs 150 lbs for the door configuration) and associated cost savings in operating the airplane. 3. A full-sized passenger window. 4. A structural component that does not have the complexity of a door with its associated parts, operations, and maintenance concerns. The accident airplane was equipped with 178 passenger seats, of which rows 1 through 4 were first class, rows 6 through 9 were premium seats, and rows 10 through 34 were economy class. The MED plugs, with a standard window each, were located at row 26 on the right and left sides of the airplane. Each door plug was about 29 inches wide and 59 inches high. The accident MED plug was manufactured by Spirit AeroSystems Malaysia on March 24, 2023, and was received at Spirit AeroSystems Wichita on May 10, 2023. The MED plug was then installed and rigged on the fuselage (Spirit AeroSystems Fuselage Line 8789) before it was shipped to Boeing on August 20, 2023. The fuselage arrived at Boeingâs Renton, Washington, facility on August 31, 2023. The MED plug is primarily constructed of aluminum and is installed in the fuselage by means of two upper guide fittings and two lower hinge fittings. The two upper guide fittings are located on the upper sides of the plug and engage with two upper guide rollers that are fixed to the upper sides of the fuselage opening. Two lower hinge guide fittings are fixed to the lower section of the plug and engage with the two lower hinge fittings that are attached to the bottom of the fuselage opening at the lower hinge bracket assemblies. Once the plug is in place, it is secured from moving vertically by a total of four bolts. There is a bolt installed through each upper guide fitting and each lower hinge guide fitting. Once these bolts are installed, they are secured using castle nuts and cotter pins. Outboard motion of the plug is prevented by 12 stop fittings (6 along each forward and aft edge) installed on the fuselage door frame structure. The door plug is only intended to be opened for maintenance and inspection, which requires removing the vertical movement arrestor bolts and upper guide track bolts. The strap assemblies below the second stop pad from the top restrict the plug from opening further than 15Â°, suitable for maintenance and inspection purposes. The NTSBâs investigative team conducted a postaccident examination of the aircraft structure, flight deck, cabin interior, cabin safety systems, and pressurization system. The cabin pressurization system maintains a safe, comfortable cabin pressure altitude and, under normal operations, the maximum cabin pressure altitude is around 8,000 ft. A postaccident review of cabin pressure/cabin altitude data before the decompression event showed that the cabin pressure control system had functioned per design with no cabin altitude or cabin rate exceedances. However, the NTSBâs examination of the airplaneâs maintenance logs identified entries indicating that a pressure controller light had illuminated on three previous flights. Pressurization on the 737-9 is managed by a triple-redundant system with two automated pressure controllers and a manual back-up system. An issue with one controller prompts the system to switch to the alternate controller automatically. If both automated pressure controllers fail, a manual back-up system can be used, which is operated by the pilots. Any one of these three systems is fully capable of maintaining safe cabin pressurization. To ensure a complete study of the pressurization system, the NTSB retained the two cabin pressure controllers and the outflow valve for further study. When the rapid decompression occurred, all flight attendant and passenger oxygen masks immediately deployed. Examination revealed that the masksâ associated chemical generators operated as designed and produced oxygen for the airplane occupants. In addition, the examination included cabin communications and lighting systems, emergency equipment, passenger safety information, the flight deck door, aircraft exits, and the condition of the cabin interior to include all seats, seat tracks, windows, doors, and interior paneling. The flight crew reported that the cockpit door had opened during the depressurization event. In a revision to the Flight Crew Operations Manual, issued on January 15, 2024, Boeing confirmed that the door functioned as designed. Damage to the passenger cabin included: damage in seat rows 25ABC and 26ABC as described below, deformation of the doorframe of the forward lavatory, and buckling and displacement of the sidewall panels and trim throughout the airplane. There were no indications of any other failures or malfunction of the airplane or any of its systems. Seat 25A was rotated out and aft approximately 10Â°â20Â° toward the opening. The seatback of Seat 26A was rotated forward and outboard.  The NTSB Structures and Materials specialists, along with representatives from parties to the investigation, examined the MED plug and associated components removed from the accident airplane. The MED plug was mostly intact with some damage from the event and appeared to be manufactured in accordance with the engineering drawings. The two vertical movement arrestor bolts, two upper guide track bolts, forward lower hinge guide fitting, and forward lift assist spring were missing and have not been recovered. Contact damage was noted on the lower sides of the 12 stop pins and fittings on the MED plug. Corresponding contact damage was noted on the 12 stop pads and fittings attached to the fuselage. Overall, the damage was consistent with the MED plug translating upward, outboard, and aft during the separation. Both upper guide fittings installed on the forward and aft sides of the MED plug, respectively, were fractured vertically through the inboard wall of the track. Examination revealed features consistent with overstress fracture and no evidence of pre-existing cracks or damage. The outboard upper guide track bolt holes were intact and exhibited no deformation. The paint in the upper guide track bolt hole bores was intact and showed no evidence of heavy contact damage. There were some light circular witness marks around the hole bores consistent with the presence of a washer at some time. The aft lower hinge guide fitting fractured from the MED plug during the event and remained attached to the aft hinge fitting. The forward lower hinge guide fitting fractured from the MED plug and separated from the forward hinge fitting. The forward hinge fitting shaft was bent inboard about 0.4Â° with corresponding contact damage noted to the MED plug lower beam. The vertical movement arrestor bolt hole bore in the forward hinge fitting was intact and undamaged. The aft hinge fitting was bent inboard about 3.7Â° with corresponding contact damage noted to the MED plug lower beam. Contact damage was noted on the inboard side of the hinge fitting shaft intersecting the vertical movement arrestor bolt hole consistent with contact with the MED plug, but the hole bore was otherwise undamaged. The outboard side of the vertical movement arrestor bolt hole was slightly elongated and exhibited small tensile cracks at the apex of the bend consistent with plastic deformation of the hinge fitting shaft. The hole bore was otherwise undamaged. The attachment flange on the aft lower hinge guide fitting was fractured at the two upper attach hole locations, and the bolts remained installed in the MED plug. The two lower attach bolts were fractured. A similar damage pattern was noted on the MED plug at the forward lower hinge guide fitting attachment location. All features were consistent with ductile overstress fracture. The vertical movement arrestor bolt holes in the aft lower hinge guide fitting were intact and undamaged. Overall, the observed damage patterns and absence of contact damage or deformation around holes associated with the vertical movement arrestor bolts and upper guide track bolts in the upper guide fittings, hinge fittings, and recovered aft lower hinge guide fitting indicate that the four bolts that prevent upward movement of the MED plug were missing before the MED plug moved upward off the stop pads. The Manufacturing Records Group traveled to Boeingâs Renton, Washington, facility to review manufacturing records for the accident airplane specific to the left MED plug area. According to records, the accident fuselage arrived at Boeingâs Renton facility by rail on August 31, 2023. During the manufacturing process, if any defects or discrepancies were found, a Non-Conformance Record (NCR) or a disposition required NCR were generated. On September 1, 2023, records show that NCR 1450292531 was created noting five damaged rivets on the edge frame forward of the left MED plug.  Documents and photos show that to perform the replacement of the damaged rivets, access to the rivets required opening the left MED plug. To open the MED plug, the two vertical movement arrestor bolts and two upper guide track bolts had to be removed. Records show the rivets were replaced per engineering requirements on Non-Conformance (NC) Order 145-8987-RSHK-1296-002NC completed on September 19, 2023, by Spirit AeroSystems personnel. Photo documentation obtained from Boeing shows evidence of theleft-hand MED plug closed with no retention hardware (bolts) in the three visible locations (the aft upper guide track is covered with insulation and cannot be seen in the photo). This image was attached to a text message between Boeing team members on September19, 2023, around 1839 local. These Boeing personnel were discussing interior restoration after the rivet rework was completed during second shift operations that day. The investigation continues to determine what manufacturing documents were used to authorize the opening and closing of the left MED plug during the rivet rework. The Human Performance Investigator joined the group to travel to Spirit AeroSystems, where they reviewed pertinent build work documents and observed a door plug installation. As mentioned earlier, the accident MED plug was manufactured by Spirit AeroSystems Malaysia on March 24, 2023, and received at Spirit AeroSystems Wichita on May 10, 2023. The MED plug was then installed and rigged on the fuselage prior to delivery to Boeing. During the build process, one quality notification (QN NW0002407062) was noted indicating the seal flushness was out of tolerance by 0.01 inches. No manufacturing rework was required, as Spirit AeroSystems Engineering determined the condition was structurally and functionally acceptable and did not adversely affect the form, fit, or function of the installation. There were no other QNs for the left MED plug before leaving Spirit AeroSystems. Fuselage Line 8789 was shipped to Boeing on August 20, 2023.  The group then traveled to AAR, Oklahoma City, where a wi-fi and PCS antenna was installed on the accident airplane from November 27, 2023, to December 7, 2023. The group reviewed applicable installation retrofit documents and received a presentation on AARâs quality assurance and safety management system (SMS) processes. The group also witnessed a wi-fi retrofit in progress. Facility representatives reported that they have modified approximately 60 Alaska Airlines 737-9 airplanes with the wi-fi and PCS antenna installation and have not had to remove or open any MED plugs for this work, to include the event airplane. The manufacturing/human performance group has done a complete records review from the time the event airplane left the Boeing factory to the time of the accident and found no evidence that the left MED plug was opened after leaving Boeingâs facility. Interviews of Boeing and Spirit AeroSystemsâ personnel will be scheduled at a future date. The group will also be looking at Boeingâs SMS and Spirit AeroSystemsâ ongoing development of its voluntary SMS program. The group will also assess the FAAâs involvement in the manufacturersâ development of their respective SMS programs and the level of oversight applied to each.  As a precaution, Alaska Airlines grounded its fleet of B737-9 airplanes to inspect the MED plugs soon after the event. Their inspections began Saturday morning, January 6, 2024. In addition, the FAA issued an emergency airworthiness directive on January 6 requiring all operators of 737-9 airplanes to conduct specific inspections before returning the airplanes to service. On January 21, 2024, the FAA published Safety Alert for Operators (SAFO) 24001 for operators that have the same MED plug as the accident airplane but on a different model of airplane. The SAFO is for Boeing 737-900ER airplanes and recommends that operators inspect, as soon as possible, the four locations where the retaining hardware secures the door to the airframe. Boeing issued multiple multi-operator messages (MOMs). The most recent, MOM 24-0010- 01B(R4) dated January 25, 2024, contains revised instructions for inspecting 737-9 airplanes that have the MED plugs. The NTSBâs investigation is ongoing.

The flight was a regularly scheduled domestic passenger flight from Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport (PHX), Phoenix, Arizona to IAH. The flight crew statements and flight data showed a stable approach to the landing flare. The first officer was pilot flying and stated he began the flare slightly late. Both crewmembers stated the touchdown was firm with a slight ânose-highâ bounce. The flight crew was not aware the airplaneâs tail had impacted the runway until the ground crew at the gate notified them. Flight data showed that the airplane touched down on the runway with a 6.5-degree nose-up attitude and vertical acceleration of 1.87g. The speed brakes deployed two seconds after the initial touchdown. At the same time, the aircraft became airborne again and the nose began to lower. Two seconds later, as the speed brakes retracted, the airplaneâs pitch began to increase, and the airplane touched down a second time with pitch of 7.2 degrees and a vertical acceleration of about 2.87g. The airplane became airborne for a 3rd time for about a second before it touched down for the final time. The nose was lowered to the ground, and speed brakes were extended again. Post-accident assessment of the aircraft revealed substantial damage to the auxiliary power unit (APU) firewall bulkhead that occurred as a result of the aircraftâs aft fuselageâs contact with the runway.  Probable Cause: The airplaneâs aft fuselage impacted the runway as a result of a delayed flare and subsequent nose-high pitch inputs during the aircraftâs multiple touchdowns.METAR: Weather about the incident time (1610Z): KIAH 101553Z 16009KT 10SM FEW150 SCT250 13/01 A2996 RMK AO2 SLP145 T01280011 KIAH 101653Z 18009KT 10SM FEW250 17/03 A2995 RMK AO2 SLP142 T01670028Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA24LA065 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA24LA065  https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=193637  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates20-Jan-2024 19:54 harro Added 08-Feb-2024 19:50 Captain Adam Updated [Time, Damage, Category, Accident report, ]04-May-2024 17:30 ASN Updated [Narrative, ]18-May-2024 19:24 Captain Adam Updated [Time, Total occupants, Location, Source, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

Once clear of clouds and with the runway in sight, the pilot canceled the instrument flight rules clearance, announced their position over the airportâs common traffic advisory frequency and received a reply with a report of 1/4 inch of dry snow covering the runway, unplowed. During the landing roll, they applied brakes, extended spoilers, and thrust reversers. Initially the airplane slowed; however, about halfway down the runway, the airplaneâs antiskid system was functioning continuously, and the airplaneâs rate of deceleration decreased. The pilot was unsure if the thrust reversers deployed, and he cycled the thrust reversers and did not feel any effects. The pilot stated that, in his experience, the airplaneâs thrust reversers do not feel very effective. The pilot considered aborting the landing, started to clean up the airplane but thought it was too late. The airplane overran the departure end of the runway, onto a grass covered area and into a deep ravine, resulting in substantial damage to the fuselage and both wings. The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation. The automated weather observation station located on the airport reported that, about 44 minutes before the accident, the wind was from 090Â° at 12 knots. The same automated station reported that, about 16 minutes after the accident, the wind was from 090Â° at 12 knots. The airplane landed on runway 22. The fixed based operator owner reported that, on the day of the accident, his review of the runway conditions at the airport appeared to be around an inch of snow on the runway surface. Additionally, plowing at the airport so far this year had been âabysmal.â Big windrows and ice chunks have been left; taxiway corners had been built up to the point there could be an occurrence should an airplane be taxiing by. Earlier this year, several departures were delayed due to the runway not being plowed. According to the chairman of the airport board, there is no formal process to conduct runway assessments. However, an airport board member lives in the area and routinely visits the airport to conduct runway assessments. The runway assessments and frequency of the observations are not documented but are conveyed verbally to the airport board via cell phone. To the best of his knowledge, there is no formal snow or ice removal plan. When the runway is required to be cleared, a board member will use county provided equipment to clear the runway. The frequency of the snow removal is not documented. The airport snow removal equipment is limited to clear substance to Â½ inch of the runway surface. On the day of the accident, he was not aware of a Notice to Air Misson (NOTAM) issued for the conditions of the runway environment. According to the airplane manufacturer, the estimated landing distance on a dry runway was about 3,350 ft, with loose snow and no tailwind the estimated landing distance was about 6,700 ft, and on loose snow with tailwind, the estimated landing distance was 7,531 ft. According to the Federal Aviation Administration, the airport is not required to have a snow and ice control plan. However, the airport was provided federal funds (grant) to purchase/acquire a snowplow to maintain the airport surfaces during inclement weather conditions. There may be times where issues arise, and action is delayed. In that case it is expected that a NOTAM be issued as outlined in the grant agreement. Probable Cause: The flight crewâs decision to land on a snow-covered runway with a tailwind, resulting in a runway excursion and subsequent impact with terrain. Contributing to the accident, was the failure of the airport authority to plow the runway.METAR: KLVM 111553Z AUTO 09012KT 10SM OVC019 M17/M19 A2968 RMK AO2 SLP131 T11671194 KLVM 111453Z AUTO 09012KT 10SM OVC019 M16/M19 A2967 RMK AO2 SLP127 60000 T11611189 53012Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: WPR24LA071 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: https://www.krtv.com/news/montana-and-regional-news/small-plane-ends-up-in-a-ravine-at-livingston-airport  https://www.kbzk.com/news/local-news/airplane-crashes-at-livingston-airport-after-missing-runway-passengers-injured  https://www.mclarens.com/auctions/1983-learjet-55-n558ra-s-n-086/  https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=193641  https://www.flightaware.com/live/flight/RAX698/history/20240111/1145Z/KPTK/KLVM  https://www.flightradar24.com/data/flights/rax698#33954ab0  Location  Images: Photos: NTSB Photos: NTSB Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates12-Jan-2024 03:43 Geno Added 12-Jan-2024 07:31 gianniprof Updated [Date, ]12-Jan-2024 07:37 harro Updated [Aircraft type, Registration, Cn, Operator, Other fatalities, Departure airport, Source, Damage, Narrative, ]12-Jan-2024 07:41 harro Updated [Other fatalities, Source, Narrative, ]12-Jan-2024 07:45 harro Updated [Other fatalities, Narrative, Category, ]12-Jan-2024 14:40 Anon.

The commercial pilot was seriously injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135 on-demand cargo flight. According to preliminary information from Federal Aviation Administration air traffic control (ATC), the airplane departed Manchester Boston Regional Airport (MHT), Manchester, New Hampshire, at 0710, destined for Presque Isle International Airport (PQI), Presque Isle, Maine. Immediately after takeoff, the airplane broadcast an emergency transponder code. The airplane then flew erratically for 16 minutes while the ATC controller attempted to establish radio contact, before it collided with wooded terrain about 5 miles south of MHT. A debris path was observed, beginning with a damaged fiber optic line about 75 ft high. The debris path extended on a magnetic course of 140Â° for about 200 ft through wooded terrain. The right aileron was found near the beginning of the debris path, suspended in a tree. The wreckage came to rest upright and oriented south at the end of the debris path. The airplaneâs left side (pilot side) cockpit door/hatch was subsequently located in a residential yard about 10 miles north of the main wreckage. Additionally, the airplane was equipped with a portable ladder for pilot entry, which secured to the fuselage under the cockpit door/hatch and was supposed to be stowed inside the cockpit before takeoff. The portable ladder was found outside and aft of the cockpit, resting against the left engine nacelle. The wreckage was retained for further examination.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA24FA097 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/plane-crash-londonderry-new-hampshire-nh-colonial-drive-beechcraft-99-faa/  NTSB  https://registry.faa.gn53rpov/AircraftInquiry/Search/NNumberResult?nNumberTxt=53RP  https://www.flightaware.com/live/flight/N53RP/history/20240126/1120Z/KMHT/KPQI  https://www.instagram.com/p/C2mp5HyO_GQ/  https://cdn.jetphotos.com/full/6/73675_1520438478.jpg (photo) History of this aircraft Ex N64977 Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  2 February 2012 N53RP UAS Transervices Inc, opf.

The airline transport pilot, commercial co-pilot, and two passengers were not injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14Code of Federal Regulations Part 135 on-demand passenger flight. The left seat pilot, who was the pilot flying (PF), reported that when the flight was about 1 hour 15 minutes from MCO, the pilot monitoring (PM) checked the automated terminal information service which advised that the wind was from 270Â° at 14 knots, gusting to 24 knots. After reviewing the runway configuration at MCO they determined the gust value was beyond limits of the airplane, but they then reviewed the operatorâs crosswind performance limits (CPL) and determined it was acceptable to continue to the planned destination. The PF planned to obtain a wind check on final approach at MCO, and if the wind was out of limits the flight would proceed to Executive Airport (ORL), Orlando, Florida, which had a more favorable runway configuration. The PF and PM briefed the arrival and while approaching MCO they checked the automated weather observing system (AWOS) several times. They noted only one instance of wind gusts reported, and that the AWOS was mostly reporting wind from 270Â° to 280Â° at 13 or 14 knots. The flight continued and was cleared for a visual approach. The PM requested a wind check and the local controller replied 290Â° at 21 knots. The PF recalled their previous review of the CPL and noted the wind was at the 19 to 20 knots crosswind component, but then referenced the wind vector on the primary flight display (PFD) and noted an 18-knot crosswind component. The PF elected to continue the approach to runway 36L as the wind was âwithin limits.â He referenced the wind vector on the PFD a final time as the flight crossed the threshold and noted the crosswind was 17 knots. The flight landed on the runway centerline in the touchdown zone and the PF applied left aileron control input to counter the crosswind and deployed the speedbrake. The airplane began drifting left, which the PF attempted to correct with right rudder input but with no effect. The airplane departed the left side of the runway surface, rolled onto grass, and impacted a runway distance remaining sign. The PF was then able to correct to the right, travel back onto the runway, then taxi off the runway at taxiway E and stop where the airplane was secured and then evacuated. According to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) audio communications from the MCO air traffic control tower local west position, at the initial contact with the local controller about 1620, the flight crew were advised the wind was from 290Â° at 21 knots. At 1622:06, a voice from an unidentified aircraft asked for a wind check on the same frequency, and the controller responded 290Â° at 19 knots ânow gusting two fourâ knots. At 1622:06, the accident airplane was about 1.24 nautical miles from the runway 36L threshold. After the accident the flight crew was asked by the controller if they experienced a flat tire, a flight crew member responded, ânegative, weâre not sure, it could have been a gust, but ah weâre not sure.â The operator reported there was no airplane or airplane systemâs warnings or malfunctions before touchdown. Examination of the airplane by an FAA inspector and a representative of the airplane manufacturer revealed no evidence of any failures or malfunctions of the primary or secondary flight controls. The rudder and aileron trims had been set at the neutral position. According to the airplane manufacturer, the left wing forward spar exhibited cracks and deformation. The airplane was equipped with a cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder which were retained for read-out. The airplane flight manual specified the crosswind limitation as 20 knots.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA24LA100 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: NTSB  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates12-Apr-2024 20:37 Captain Adam Added 11-Oct-2024 11:59 ASN Updated Corrections or additions? ...

The captain and co-pilot were fatally injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 positioning flight. The airplane, which was operated by Vici Aviation, LLC and managed by Clay Lacy Aviation, Inc., arrived at West Star Aviationâs facility at Grand Junction Regional Airport (GJT), Grand Junction, Colorado on December 20, 2023 for routine maintenance. According to preliminary information from the maintenance facility, multiple routine inspections had been completed on the airplane including a requirement to remove the wing leading edges and TKS panels to inspect for cracks and signs of corrosion. After the inspections were completed, the airplane was returned to service on February 6, 2024. The flight crew had planned to fly the airplane from GJT to Gig Harbor, Washington on the day of the accident, during which time they would perform a stall warning and systems check in accordance with the airframe manufacturerâs requirements. These requirements, which were listed in the pilotâs operating manual, included a required altitude above 10,000 ft above ground level, 10,000 ft above clouds and below 18,000 ft mean sea level. In addition, this check flight could only be conducted during day visual meteorological conditions with a good visual horizon, with the autopilot disengaged, an operative stall identification system, the external surfaces free of ice, the ventral tank empty and weather radar on standby. According to preliminary automatic dependent system broadcast (ADS-B) data, the airplane departed GJT at 1037 and entered a climb on a southeast heading. The flight crew asked air traffic control (ATC) for a block of altitude from FL180 to FL200 and ATC approved the request. The airplane circled to the northwest as it continued to climb and subsequently leveled off at 1043:49, near the top of the altitude block. At 1046:47 the flight track data showed the airplane begin a rapid descent in circular pattern that resembled the shape of a corkscrew. The airplane made multiple rotations before the track ceased at 1047:44. The airplane came to rest in flat open terrain about 25 nm northwest of GJT at an elevation of about 4,800 ft mean sea level and oriented on a west heading. The airplaneâs major structures were all accounted for at the accident site. A debris path was traced from the main wreckage to the end of a burn area that was about 200 ft long and 175 ft wide at the widest point, oriented on a magnetic heading of 345Â°. A silhouette of the left wing, fuselage and both engines was located about 10 ft south of the main wreckage. The airplaneâs flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder were both recovered from the accident site. The wreckage has also been retained for further examination.METAR: Weather at the departure airport about the departure (1737Z) and accident time (1747Z): KGJT 071753Z 35008KT 10SM -RA BKN037 OVC055 07/02 A2959 RMK AO2 RAE08B26 SLP994 P0000 60001 T00670017 10083 20044 51013 KGJT 071653Z 17009KT 10SM -RA BKN047 OVC085 07/00 A2957 RMK AO2 RAB37 SLP988 P0001 T00720000Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: WPR24FA083 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: https://www.kkco11news.com/2024/02/07/possible-plane-crash-reported-near-loma/  NTSB  https://globe.adsbexchange.com/?icao=ac7108&lat=39.123&lon=-108.648&zoom=8.4&showTrace=2024-02-07&trackLabels  Location  Media: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates07-Feb-2024 19:53 Captain Adam Added 07-Feb-2024 20:50 nhofmann54 Updated [Registration, Cn, Operator, Phase, Departure airport, Source, Damage, ]07-Feb-2024 20:56 ASN Updated [Time, Phase, Departure airport, Narrative, ]07-Feb-2024 21:00 ASN Updated [Source, ]07-Feb-2024 21:40 Anon.

While taxiing within the Amelia Earhart de-icing pad area, the left winglet of JetBlue Airways flight 777 collided with the right horizontal stabilizer and elevator of JetBlue Airways flight 551. There were no injuries to the 210 passengers and crew on flight 551 or the 154 passengers and crew on flight 777. The flight crew of flight 551 stated that, following a normal preflight and uneventful taxi from the gate to the de-icing pad, they were guided by a 'follow me' vehicle. The flight crew proceeded to follow the vehicle to the D2 parking spot. A yellow painted 'T' inside a black square marked the proper stopping point location for the airplane's nose tires when parked. Nearing the stopping point, the 'follow me' vehicle turned to the right and stopped with its headlights facing toward the back of the airplane. The driver of the 'follow me' vehicle communicated with the flight crew via radio and began a 'countdown' for when the captain should stop the airplane.  Upon the verbal stop command, the captain stopped the airplane and set the parking brake. After the de-ice procedure was complete, the flight crew received instructions to taxi the airplane to runway 9 for departure. Immediately after releasing the airplane's parking brake, the flight crew felt jolts and vibrations and the airplane swayed back and forth. The captain set the parking brake and the first officer (FO) contacted air traffic control (ATC) and was informed they had been struck by another aircraft. In a post-accident statement, the driver of the 'follow me' vehicle indicated that he stopped the airplane (flight 551) at what he thought was the normal stopping point.  He had difficulty seeing the yellow 'T' -bar due to the dark night conditions and the de-icing fluid that was present on the ground. A post-accident inspection found that the airplane was about 35 ft short of the normal stopping point.  The flight crew of flight 777 indicated that after a normal preflight and uneventful taxi from the gate to the de-icing pad they were guided to the D1 spot by a 'follow me' vehicle. The captain stated spacing appeared to be tight and he focused on the yellow taxi line to ensure proper clearance from other airplanes in the area. Shortly thereafter, while taxiing, the flight crew heard a grinding noise and felt a vibration. While still moving forward, they heard another aircraft on the radio frequency ask if something had struck their airplane. The flight crew of flight 777 stopped their airplane and set the parking brake. The captain had difficulty seeing the left winglet due to the dark night conditions but noted that it was intact. In addition, he was unable to see the empennage of flight 551 parked at the D2 location as it was behind them. Flight 551 (N956JT) sustained substantial damage to the left horizontal stabilizer and the left elevator. As a result of this event, Aeromag investigated and produced a February 12, 2024, memo to their BOS-JBU [JetBlue] operations staff discussing an amendment to the Coordinator of Traffic and Movement (CTM) phraseology and aircraft stopping procedures. The memo outlined the updated procedures and phraseology as: â¢	âFollow meâ truck is now required to verbally confirm with the flight crew that the aircraft is correctly stopped on the deicing âTâ-Bar. â¢	JetBlue will add to the Airport Briefing Guide (ABG) that the pilot will not configure the aircraft until confirmation that the aircraft is correctly stopped on the deicing âTâ-Bar. â¢	The âfollow meâ truck is required to check the rear of the aircraft to ensure that it is within the bay and clear of the zipper line before confirming brake set.  â¢	Safety Lead will perform a secondary check, reconfirming with the CTM that the aircraft has stopped on the deicing âTâ-Bar. Safety Lead will also verify that the rear of the aircraft is clear of the zipper line and within the bay.  â¢	Truck positioning and aircraft deicing will commence after these checks have been completed. Additionally, once CTM has confirmed with the flight crew that they have a visual on the âfollow meâ truck, the âfollow meâ truck operator will follow these steps: 1. Guide the aircraft into the assigned bay.  2. Ensure the aircraft is properly stopped on the deicing âTâ-Bar.  3. Confirm that the rear of the aircraft is within the bay, clear of the zipper line, before bringing any other aircraft in. Finally, the Safety Lead will:  1. Inspect and confirm with CTM that the aircraft is properly stopped on the deicing âTâ-Bar.  2. Inspect that the rear of the aircraft is well within the bay and clear of the zipper line. Aeromag also increased its daily roster to include sufficient qualified staff to allocate a Safety Lead dedicated to each operational bay regardless of operating conditions. Long term prevention strategies identified were: â¢	Repainting and reviewing the color format of the delineated markings using high-visibility paint and/or reflective inset markers. â¢	Investigating the feasibility of adding high mast lighting for the Earhart facility. â¢	Operational audits to focus on the correct positioning of aircraft while maintaining the safety buffer zones. â¢	Explore opportunities to locate Aeromag tower personnel in elevated positions. Probable Cause: The 'follow me' driver stopping the airplane (flight 551) about 35 feet from the normal stopping point due to a difficulty in seeing the yellow 'T'-bar because of the dark night conditions and the presence of de-icing fluid on the ground.METAR: Weather about the time of the incident: KBOS 081054Z 13003KT 10SM FEW070 FEW250 M02/M03 A3032 RMK AO2 SLP265 T10171028 KBOS 081154Z 00000KT 10SM FEW040 SCT070 M02/M03 A3032 RMK AO2 SLP267 T10171028 10006 21022 53002 KBOS 081254Z 00000KT 10SM BKN055 01/M02 A3034 RMK AO2 SLP274 T00111017Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA24LA092B Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: https://www.boston25news.com/news/local/two-jet-blue-planes-collide-ground-bostons-logan-airport/DNURNM3MMVCKFC25DX2VLOMM2Q/  https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=193765  https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/n2157j#33eb1f23  Location  Media:#BREAKINGNEWS: Two Jet Blue planes collided on the ground at Logan Airport on Thursday morning, FAA says?Dave Sauter, Real Ryan B, and Scott Pickard https://t.co/BNaicCKSgY pic.twitter.com/sskdKm9znXâ Boston 25 News (@boston25) February 8, 2024 Aircraft incident #Boston Logan airport.

The two pilots were fatally injured. The cabin attendant and the two passengers sustained minor injuries, and one person on the ground suffered minor injury.  The airplane was returning to Naples Municipal Airport (APF), Naples, Florida, from Ohio State University Airport (OSU), Columbus, Ohio, where it had flown earlier in the day. The airplane was serviced with 350 gallons of fuel before departure from OSU. The flight crew contacted the ATC tower at APF while on a right downwind leg of the approach to the airport and maneuvering for a 5-mile final approach to runway 23. At 15:08, the tower controller cleared the flight to land. The airplane was about 6.5 miles north of APF as it turned for the base leg of the traffic pattern. A preliminary review by the NTSB of the FDR data revealed that the first of three Master Warnings was recorded at 1509:33 (L ENGINE OIL PRESSURE), the second immediately following at 1509:34 (R ENGINE OIL PRESSURE), and at 1509:40 (ENGINE). The system alerted pilots with illumination of a âMaster Warningâ light on the glareshield, a corresponding red message on the crew alerting system page and a triple chime voice advisory (âEngine oilâ). Twenty seconds later, at 1510:05, about 1,000 ft msl and 122 kts, on a shallow intercept angle for the final approach course, the crew announced, ââ¦lost both enginesâ¦ emergencyâ¦ making an emergency landingâ. The tower controller acknowledged the call and cleared the airplane to land. At 1510:12, about 900 ft and 115 knots, the crew replied, âWe are cleared to land but we are not going to make the runwayâ¦ ahâ¦ we have lost both engines.â There were no further transmissions from the flight crew. The aircraft descended towards Interstate 75 and touched down aligned with traffic travelling the southbound lanes. The left main landing gear touched down first in the center of the three lanes, and then the right main landing gear touched down in the right lane. The airplane continued through the break-down lane and into the grass shoulder area before impacting a concrete sound barrier. After the airplane came to rest, the cabin attendant stated that she identified that the cabin and emergency exits were blocked by fire and coordinated the successful egress of her passengers and herself through the baggage compartment door in the tail section of the airplane. An inspection of the engine, fuel system and oil filters revealed no immediate anomalies. The MFCs and main fuel pumps from both engines, the fuel injectors from both engines, and all collected fuel samples were retained by the NTSB for further examination. Both engines were also retained for additional examination.METAR: Weather about the accident time (2010Z) KAPF 092053Z 18009KT 10SM BKN050 26/14 A3012 RMK AO2 SLP199 T02560139 56018 KAPF 091953Z 22010KT 10SM SCT050 24/14 A3013 RMK AO2 SLP202 T02440144Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA24FA110 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: https://winknews.com/2024/02/09/plane-crash-i-75-collier-county/  https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/09/us/plane-crash-florida-highway-naples.html  https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/02/09/plane-crash-i-75-naples-florida/72542835007/  NTSB  https://registry.faa.gov/AircraftInquiry/Search/NNumberResult?nNumberTxt=823KD  https://www.flightaware.com/live/flight/HPJ823/history/20240209/1730Z/KOSU/KAPF  https://archive.liveatc.net/kapf/KAPF1-Tower-Feb-09-2024-2000Z.mp3   https://cdn.jetphotos.com/full/5/707837_1706244336.jpg (photo)  https://www.hopajetworldwide.com/aircraft/n823kd/ History of this aircraft Ex (N316KD), N823KD, N828KD, C-FAWU, C-GLXM Location  Media: BREAKING: We're learning more about a plane crash in Naples on I-75. pic.twitter.com/3slB22MMgLâ ABC7 Sarasota (@mysuncoast) February 9, 2024 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates09-Feb-2024 20:32 ASN Added 09-Feb-2024 20:33 ASN Updated [Embed code, Damage, Category, ]09-Feb-2024 20:37 ASN Updated [Aircraft type, Source, Embed code, Narrative, ]09-Feb-2024 20:40 ASN Updated [Aircraft type, Registration, Cn, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, ]09-Feb-2024 20:42 ASN Updated [Time, Operator, Phase, Narrative, ]09-Feb-2024 20:47 ASN Updated [Narrative, ]09-Feb-2024 20:52 ASN Updated [Source, Embed code, ]09-Feb-2024 21:02 ASN Updated [Location, Embed code, Narrative, Category, ]09-Feb-2024 21:04 ASN Updated 09-Feb-2024 22:14 nhofmann54 Updated [Total fatalities, Total occupants, Other fatalities, Source, ]10-Feb-2024 07:35 Vice Captain Edmond Updated [Nature, Narrative, ]10-Feb-2024 07:37 ASN Updated [Narrative, ]10-Feb-2024 09:05 RobertMB Updated [Time, Aircraft type, Operator, Location, Nature, Source, Narrative, ]10-Feb-2024 10:14 Captain Adam Updated [Source, Narrative, ]10-Feb-2024 15:42 Iceman 29 Updated [Embed code, ]11-Feb-2024 10:11 Anon.

The flight crew performed a go-around and proceeded for a landing on runway 26R, 18 minutes later.  The aircraft operated on a flight from Tel Aviv (TLV) with the captain being Pilot Monitoring (PM) and the first officer being Pilot Flying (PF). At 17:22, the pilots performed the approach briefing. At 17:47, the airplane captured the localizer and the pilots received the clearance for an ILS approach 26L. Two minutes later the PM reported âlocalizer establishedâ. The approach was flown manually and the engine thrust levers were controlled manually. During the approach, the landing checklist was completed and at 17:53:20, at 1,000 ft, the co-pilot, as Pilot Flying (PF), determined the approach as stabilised. The PM confirmed it and the approach was continued. As the runway was reached, the PF initiated the flare of the airplane and attempted to align it with the runway from a crosswind approach. At 17:54:31, the airplane touched down for the first time. It lifted off again, rolled right and at 17:54:34, touched down again. At 17:54:37, both pilots almost simultaneously said âgo-aroundâ and the captain intervened in the steering.  During the second bounce the nose was pitched up and at the same time the ground spoilers extended. The combination of both caused the nose to pitch up to +13.7 degrees and the tail strike occurred. The captain then performed the go-around and acted as PF until the landing at 18:12.

Of the 280 passengers and crew, two flight attendants received serious injuries and one received a minor injury. The flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 as a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), Los Angeles, California to EWR. The first officer (FO) was the pilot flying and the captain was the pilot monitoring. The flight crew stated that the departure from LAX was uneventful and the flight leveled off at a cruise altitude of FL350. The FO stated that he was responsible for briefing the approach/arrival into EWR and in preparation for the brief, checked for potential turbulence using the Weather Services International (WSI) application (APP) and used the Skypath APP to see if there were any reports of turbulence. Neither application revealed any significant indications of turbulence along their route. After the brief, the captain turned the onboard weather radar ON for the eventual descent into EWR. The FO stated that while descending through about FL270, the captain announced via the passenger address (PA) system for the flight attendants (FA) to prepare the cabin for landing. Following the announcement, the captain turned the seatbelt sign ON. The FO stated that he observed an overcast layer of clouds ahead and below that the flight would penetrate on their descent to EWR. However, there was no indication of potential turbulence as nothing showed on the aircraft's weather radar or the Skypath APP. Additionally, there were no reports of turbulence from ATC or dispatch. The pilots reported that while descending through about FL210 in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), the flight encountered moderate turbulence lasting a few seconds that caused unsecured items on the flightdeck to be thrown about. After the event, the captain immediately called the cabin crew and was informed of multiple injuries with one flight attendant sustaining a head laceration. Upon being notified of the injuries, the flight crew declared a medical emergency and requested paramedics meet the aircraft at the gate in EWR. Post-flight, two FAâs were diagnosed with fracture injuries and a third was diagnosed with a sub-cranial bleed. Postaccident examination of the weather in the area revealed a frontal boundary moving eastward across New York state. In addition, an upper-level jet stream maximum was located above the accident site. Satellite and weather radar imagery, along with lightning and surface data depicted strong cells in the vicinity of the flight. The U.S National Weather Service (NWS) had issued current Significant Meteorological (SIGMET) warning for embedded thunderstorms with tops reaching FL280 over the region. NTSB group chairs in the areas of air traffic control, operations, meteorology, survival factors, and flight data recorder were assigned.Qualified parties were invited to participate in the investigation. These included the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), United Airlines, The Boeing Company, Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), and the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA). Certified ADS-B data and audio recordings were provided to the NTSB by the FAA. The NTSB is currently analyzing this data. At the time of the accident, flight 1890 was being controlled by air traffic control located at the Boston Air Route Traffic Control Center (ZBW ARTCC). During the week of March 4th, 2024, the ATC group and meteorology specialist traveled to Nashua, New Hampshire to interview personnel at the control center. Data from the digital flight data recorder (DFDR) and the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) were sent to the NTSBâs Vehicle Recorder Laboratory in Washington, DC, for analysis. The investigation continues.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA24LA097 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: FAA  https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/n788ua#33f25f48 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  30 September 2024 N788UA United Airlines 0 148 nm NW of Calgary, AB non Fumes/smoke/odor event Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates12-Feb-2024 20:43 ASN Added 13-Feb-2024 07:31 ASN Updated [Time, Location, Narrative, ]16-Feb-2024 12:29 harro Updated [Other fatalities, ]12-Mar-2024 20:14 Captain Adam Updated [Time, Location, Narrative, Category, Accident report, ]01-Apr-2024 09:10 ASN Updated Corrections or additions? ...

Inspectors from the Federal Aviation Administration responded to the accident site and visually examined the airplane. The elevator control cable was found separated in the area of the vertical stabilizer. The airplane was retained for further examination.

There were no injuries. During the flight preparation, the crew planned to take off from runway 30L, intersection D6. The Take-Off Run Available (TORA) distance at D6 is 2349 meters. The  flight parameter calculations for this intersection were double-checked by the crew. The crew then received instructions from ATC to taxi to position D6 for runway 30L via taxiways F, G, and A, which the crew correctly read back.  At 16:35 UTC, the crew informed the ATC unit that they were approaching intersection D6: ""Air Serbia 86C, approaching  D6, ready."" The controller responded by instructing the flight to hold short, followed by a clearance to line up and wait via D6. At 16:36 UTC, ATC urgently contacted the crew, inquiring if they were aware they were at intersection D5 instead of D6. The crew quickly responded, thanking for the information. ATC immediately contacted the crew again, informing them that the available takeoff length from the given intersection was 1,273 meters, suggesting it was insufficient for a safe takeoff.  The crew requested a minute to perform checks. According to the crew's statement, they then performed flight parameter calculations using the copilot's tablet. During this time, ATC instructed the crew to perform necessary calculations and to contact them, with the option to backtrack to D6 if needed.  Thirty seconds later, the crew contacted the ATC, confirming they were ready for takeoff. ATC acknowledged, asking if they could take off from position/intersection D5, which the crew immediately confirmed. ATC then cleared the flight to take off from runway 30L from position D5, informing them of no wind.  At 16:38 UTC, the aircraft began its takeoff roll.  During the takeoff roll the flight crew made engine thrust changes to achieve a higher speed. At 80 knots, the crew stated everything was normal, but at 100 knots, they noticed insufficient runway length. Considering the available runway length and the aircraft's speed, the crew decided it was safer to continue the takeoff, estimating the aircraft would soon become airborne. They set the engine thrust to maximum and decided to delay rotating the nose of the aircraft to utilize the maximum available runway length and asphalt area beyond the runway. Shortly after leaving the runway and asphalt area, according to the flight crew's statement, the aircraft began to shake, followed by a sound of impact against an object. The plane quickly became airborne, during which the crew continuously heard an unfamiliar noise from the aircraft's body, with interruptions in the operation of the left wing lights. Upon receiving information about issues with several systems, including flaps and engine bleed air, the crew followed the indicated checklist procedures for troubleshooting. Shortly after takeoff, ATC contacted the crew, inquiring about the deviation from the approved flight vector during takeoff. The crew replied that they were unsure but would likely need to return to the airport. Soon after, the crew informed ATC that they needed to return because they had hit something on the ground during takeoff. A little later, they declared a mayday. ATC suggested the crew check the landing gear, with the possibility of a low pass by the control tower. The crew requested time for additional checks, performing two circuits southeast of the airport. According to the crew's statements, they checked the aircraft using checklists to locate the problem. Meanwhile, ATC prepared for the emergency landing. The aircraft then performed a low pass over the runway heading 300 with the landing gear extended, with no issues identified by ATC regarding the landing gear. During descent and flight, the crew reported problems with the flaps and increased aircraft vibrations. After the flyby, the crew decided to land, proceeding with a left turn into the airport circuit, followed by landing on the left runway, runway 30L, at 17:36 UTC. According to the crew's statement, they opted for a slightly higher landing speed due to problems with the flaps, but within prescribed limits, experiencing only vibrations as an issue. After landing, the crew had no further problems with the aircraft and, following communication with ATC, agreed to park at parking position C2. Upon stopping, the crew received information from ground personnel that fuel was leaking from the left wing, quickly shutting down the engines and other systems. During the inspection, significant damage to the aircraft's fuselage was discovered, including multiple punctures on the left side, damage to the root of the left wing with aerodynamic fairing damage at the fuselage-wing junction, punctures in the aircraft's fairing, and damage to the aircraft systems below the fairing, damage to the leading edge of the wing adjacent to the fuselage. During the inspection of airport surfaces in the direction of the aircraft's takeoff from RWY30L, damage to the approach lights for RWY12R was found - the extreme right lights in all three rows (or extreme left in the direction of the aircraft's takeoff) with damage to the control boxes located in the middle of the lights. During rotation, the left wing root hit the support for the Instrument Landing System (ILS) monitor antenna. The antenna broke off, the larger part of which remained embedded in the aircraft. PROBABLE CAUSE (preliminary, the investigation is ongoing): One of the likely causes of this accident is the inadequate assessment of parameters for takeoff during pre-flight preparation by the flight crew of the aircraft, following the decision to take off from a shorter length of the runway in relation to the initially planned one.METAR: METARs about the incident time (1638Z): LYBE 181700Z 02002KT CAVOK 10/04 Q1030 NOSIG= LYBE 181630Z 33002KT CAVOK 10/04 Q1030 NOSIG=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CINS Report number: 01-24 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/oy-gdc#340bbf81  https://globe.adsbexchange.com/?icao=459c83&lat=44.824&lon=20.291&zoom=16.3&showTrace=2024-02-18&trackLabels  https://www.exyuaviation.com/2024/02/marathon-e195-operating-for-air-serbia.html History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  16 October 2017 G-FBEM Flybe 0 near Dublin Airport (EIDW) non Fumes/smoke/odor event Location  Images: Media:??Runway excursion Accident Embraer ERJ-195LR OY-GDC.

The flight was a local maintenance test flight. The purpose of the test flight was to validate maintenance conducted after a write-up for abnormal flight deck noises that occurred on a previous flight.  According to the flight crew, they conducted a flaps 5, reduced power takeoff from runway 28R. The captain recalled the aircraft accelerated faster than normal and had the propensity to lift off prior to the rotation speed of 127 knots. At rotation speed, the captain began a normal aft pull on the control yoke and the pitch attitude increased faster than expected. The captain just called âpositive rate' when the crew heard and felt a âboom.' As this flight was a test flight, it was not loaded with passengers and cargo to a takeoff weight typical of flights the pilot flying normally flew. The pilot flying rotated at a rate ânormal' to his experience, however because the accident aircraft was loaded lighter than normal, the normal rotation inputs resulted in an over-rotation.    The crew assessed the instruments and controllability and decided to continue their climb to flight level (FL) 190 [19,000 feet] where they conducted the tailstrike checklist. They returned to SFO and conducted a flaps 30 landing with no further incident. Prior to leaving the flight deck after the flight, the first officer received the pitch report for takeoff which showed that tail contact occurred about 12.2 degrees during departure and the actual pitch for this departure reached 15.3 degrees.  Inspection of the aircraft showed that the tail strike damaged the chord, web, and stiffeners of the auxiliary power unit firewall bulkhead. Because the damage would adversely affect the structural strength of the bulkhead and require major repair or replacement, the damage was considered substantial. The investigation determined that the maintenance conducted prior to this test flight was not related to the accident. The aircraft was repaired and resumed regular service on 23 March 2024. Probable Cause: The crew's over-rotation of the aircraft pitch during takeoff which resulted in a tailstrike.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA24LA110 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA24LA110  https://www.flightaware.com/live/flight/N13138/history/20240226/0210Z/KSFO/KSFO History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  16 November 2021 N13138 United Airlines 0 Boston-Logan International Airport, MA (BOS/KBOS) min APU failure 9 February 2023 N13138 United Airlines 0 N of Tampa, FL non Turbulence Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates18-May-2024 18:22 Captain Adam Added 18-May-2024 19:08 ASN Updated [Location, Phase, Source, Narrative, ]20-Jul-2024 07:27 ASN Update Bot Updated [Time, Cn, Operator, Other fatalities, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, ]20-Jul-2024 08:04 ASN Updated [Source, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The Cessna crashed in Nairobi National Park, killing both occupants, and was destroyed. The Dash 8 safely returned to Wilson Airport. All 39 passengers and five crew on board were not injured. The aircraft sustained damage to the leading edge of the right-hand horizontal stabilizer. The Cessna operated on a training flight and was performing touch-and-goes on runway 07. The Safarilink Dash 8 was cleared for takeoff by the tower controller and the crew was told to look out for traffic upwind runway 07 (5Y-NNJ). The upwind traffic was also advised to look out for the DHC-8 departing runway 14.  According to the crew, while climbing through 400 ft, the captain had visual traffic to his 8 oâclock position which he described as being well clear of conflict. At approximately 6,000ft, the crew heard a loud bang and felt an impact. The PIC felt an imbalance (a yaw) and immediately tried to recover stability of the aircraft. The PIC stopped climbing and leveled off at 6,200ft.  The flight then returned to WIL after reported a possible collision with another aircraft. The collision is said to have occurred on the Cessna's early downwind leg.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAID Kenya Report number:  Status: Preliminary reportDuration: 1 monthDownload report:  Preliminary report Sources: https://www.kenyans.co.ke/news/98274-kenyan-airline-issues-update-after-reports-two-planes-collide-midair  https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/nairobi/article/2001490931/safarilink-plane-forced-to-turn-back-to-nairobi-after-mid-air-collision  https://www.thecitizen.co.tz/tanzania/news/east-africa-news/plane-turns-back-to-wilson-airport-after-mid-air-collision--4545998  https://twitter.com/CAA_Kenya/status/1764949671200346140  https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2024-03-05-two-dead-44-escape-unhurt-as-two-planes-collide-at-nairobi-national-park/ Media:Safarilink Incident: Update: 001.

The left main landing gear (MLG) departed the paved surface and contacted a concrete structure that was recessed into the ground, resulting in its separation.  The 6 crew and 160 passengers were deplaned via airstairs.  No injuries were reported.  The flight was a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 scheduled domestic passenger flight from Memphis International Airport (MEM), Memphis, Tennessee to IAH.  In response to the accident, the NTSB traveled to Houston. As part of the investigative process, the NTSB invited qualified parties to participate in the investigation. These included the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), United Airlines, The Boeing Company, and the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA). The parties were formed into specialized investigative groups led by NTSB group chairs in the areas of Operations, Human Performance, Systems, Structures, Digital Flight Data Recorder (DVDR) and Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR). History of Flight According to the flight crew, the captain was the pilot flying and the first officer (FO) was the pilot monitoring. The captain said he observed the reported runway surface condition codes when checking the automatic terminal information system (ATIS) via his electronic flight bag (EFB). For runway 26L and 26R, he recalled seeing codes of 3/3/3 and for runway 27 codes of 5/5/5. The actual runway surface condition codes being broadcasted on the ATIS for runway 27 at the time were 3/3/3 which according to the runway condition assessment matrix (RCAM) indicated the runway was slippery when wet and âbraking deceleration is noticeably reduced for the wheel braking effort applied or directional control is noticeably reduced.â When the crew checked in with Houston Approach Control, they were told to expect a landing on runway 26L. The captain asked the FO to request a landing on runway 27 instead. The FO made, and the controller approved the request and issued instructions for the instrument landing system (ILS) approach to runway 27. After checking in with Houston Tower (about 12,000 feet msl according to the FO), the captain asked the FO to request approval to roll to the end of runway 27. The FO made the request. A tower controller approved it and instructed them, âkeep your speed upâ. The captain changed the autobrake setting from 2 to 1 (which would command a reduced deceleration rate). The approach was conducted in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) and, according to the crew, the airplane broke out of the clouds between 800 and 1,000 feet msl. They reported that visibility under the clouds was good, and the captain recalled that the runway appeared dry. The FO recalled that the runway appeared wet. The crew stated that the touchdown was uneventful, at an appropriate speed, and within the touchdown zone. The speed brakes extended normally, and the thrust reversers were deployed to idle reverse thrust. The captain said that, shortly after touchdown, he retracted the speedbrakes by the action of moving the speedbrake lever to its down and locked position, which disabled the autobrakes. He did not âslow too much initiallyâ because the runway appeared dry, he wanted to expedite their time on the runway, and because he preferred decelerating gradually for passenger comfort.  The captain said he applied the brakes manually using the toe brakes at about 6,000 feet from the end of the runway but felt as if the deceleration was less than normal. DFDR data and automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) data indicated that after the disabling of the autobrakes occurred, manual braking did not begin until the airplane was about 4,000 feet from the end of the runway. The captain recalled hearing the runway awareness and advisory system (RAAS) alert indicating 1,000 ft of runway distance remaining. He became concerned and began applying more pressure to the brakes. As he approached the end of the runway, he elected to attempt to turn onto taxiway SC, by utilizing the steering tiller and rudder pedals while pushing aggressively on the brake pedals. During the turn onto the taxiway, he felt the fuselage and rudder/brake pedals begin to shake violently. He briefly released the brake pressure and the shaking ceased. He then reapplied aggressive brake pressure and the shaking resumed. The airplane slid off the runway and the left MLG tires and nose wheels tires entered the grass before the airplane came to a rest with its left wing low. A postaccident examination of the accident site revealed that the left MLG tires had impacted a large concrete âmanholeâ designed as an electrical junction box for lights/utilities at the airport. As a result of the impact, the left MLG separated from the airplane at the fuse pins near the rear spar as designed to prevent more severe damage to surrounding structures. The airplane came to rest on the left engine nacelle, left winglet, and aft fuselage and sustained substantial damage to the left wing and aft fuselage. Flight Crew The captain was 61 years old and held an airline transport pilot (ATP) certificate with a rating for multiengine-land, commercial privileges for airplane single engine land, and type ratings on the B-727, B-737, B-757, B-767 which included the limitation English Proficient. He held an FAA first-class medical certificate dated October 4, 2023, with the limitation of must use corrective lenses to meet vision standards at all required distances. The captain was hired by United Airlines on April 29, 1987, and had accumulated about 15,191 hours in B-737 aircraft with about 9,607 of those hours as pilot-in-command. The FO was 38 years old and held an ATP certificate with a rating for multi-engine land, commercial privileges for airplane single engine land, and type ratings in the B-737, and L-188 which included the limitation of B-737 Circling approach VMC Only, and English Proficient. He held an FAA first-class medical certificate dated June 8, 2023. The FO was hired by United Airlines on October 1, 2019, and had accumulated about 1,252 hours in B-737 aircraft. Weather Conditions and Flight Crew Procedures A Meteorological Aerodrome Report (METAR) at IAH was reporting at 0753 CST, wind from 190Â° at 5 knots, tower visibility 1 Â½ mile in mist, ceiling broken at 800 ft agl, overcast at 1,800 ft, temperature 23Â°C (73Â°F), dew point temperature 22Â°C (71Â°F), altimeter 29.71 inches of mercury. Remarks: automated observation system with a precipitation discriminator, surface visibility 2 Â½ miles, sea level pressure 1005.9-hPa, temperature 22.8Â°C, dew point 21.7Â°C. Photos and surveillance video during and immediately following the accident indicated wet runway and taxiway surface conditions. United Airlines supplementary flight crew procedures required for âLanding on Wet or Slippery Runwayâ stated in part: ??? ??????? ??????? ?????? ?? ???? ?? ???????? ????? ???? ????? ?????????. ?????? ????????? ??? ???? ????????? ?? ???? ?????. ?? ??? ???? ??? ??? ???? ????? ?? ?????????. ????????? ???????? ????????? ??? ???????? ???????? ?? ??? ??????? ?????? ???? ????? ??? ?????? ?? ????????? ??????? ?? 3 ?? ???, ?? ???????????. ?? ??? ????? ??????, ????????? ?????? ?????????? ?? ??????? ?????? ?????????, ?? ???????????? ??? ??? ??? ??????????. Data Data from the DFDR was sent to the NTSBâs Vehicle Recorder Laboratory in Washington, DC, for analysis. Data showed that at touchdown the speed brake lever position [Speed Brake Lever Pos] and auto brake parameters were full up and on for about 5 seconds before transitioning to down and locked and off for the remainder of the landing rollout. The engine thrust reversers were deployed for the left and right engines for about 27 and 26 seconds respectively at idle reverse. The left and right brake pressure increased to their maximum pressure consistent with aggressive manual braking before and as the airplaneâs heading changed consistent with a right turn. The CVR was removed from the airplane and sent to the NTSBâs Vehicle Recorder Laboratory in Washington, DC, for analysis. Certified ADS-B data, which records more accurate latitude and longitude data than the DFDR, was provided to the NTSB by the FAA. Analysis of the ADS-B and DFDR data shows that the airplane touched down about 1,000 feet from the runway threshold with a groundspeed of about 158 knots. With about 1,000 ft and 500 ft of runway remaining the airplane groundspeeds were about 72 kts and 57 kts respectively. The right turn to exit the runway was initiated at about 39 kts groundspeed and the aircraft departed the end of the paved surface at about 22 kts.METAR: weather about the incident time (1358Z): KIAH 081453Z 16005KT 1 1/2SM BR BKN008 OVC020 23/22 A2972 RMK AO2 SLP063 60002 T02280222 51014 KIAH 081353Z 19005KT 1 1/2SM BR BKN008 OVC018 23/22 A2971 RMK AO2 SFC VIS 2 1/2 SLP059 T02280217Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA24FA120 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: https://www.click2houston.com/news/local/2024/03/08/plane-goes-off-runway-at-bush-airport-no-injuries-reported/  https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/n27290#344859ac  Location  Media:So this happened todayâ¦#UnitedAirlines #imsafe #Houston #IAH #flying #plane #Memphisflight pic.twitter.com/gLKBsXnDTQâ Vicki.O (@VickiO_theDO) March 8, 2024 â¦@flightradar24â© UAL2477 (?) off the runway at IAH pic.twitter.com/d2w5g1D8Kbâ Ren Ganner (@RenGanner) March 8, 2024 Up close photos of @United Flight 2477 (Boeing 737 MAX 8) that left the runway and came to a stop in grass at George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH) in Houston. @KPRC2 has learned no one was injured. ?

The flight was a regularly scheduled passenger flight from Northwest Florida Beaches International Airport (ECP), Panama City, Florida to BWI. As a result of the turbulence, one flight attendant sustained serious injuries. The airplane was not damaged, and the flight continued to BWI without further incident.  The flight deck crew reported that they were aware of, and had received, pilot reports of turbulence at lower altitudes on arrival into BWI. They had coordinated with the cabin crew during their preflight briefing about securing the cabin early and reiterated this again (as well as asking them to take their seats afterward) just prior to starting a standard terminal arrival (the RAVNN SIX) into BWI. As they began the arrival, they learned of a pilot report of severe turbulence at flight level (FL) 250 from an airplane on arrival into nearby Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA), Arlington, Virginia.  While the cabin crew were securing the cabin and galleys, the airplane encountered severe turbulence as it descended through FL270. The captain immediately made a public address announcement to the cabin for the flight attendants to take their seats. Flight attendants B and C were âtossed aroundâ¦.sent into the airâ before landing on the floor of the aft galley. Flight attendant C sustained a hairline fracture to the left arm. A non-revenue Southwest Airlines flight attendant who was seated in the rear of the airplane rendered assistance to flight attendant C.  The captain declared a medical emergency and received an expedited approach into BWI. The first officer coordinated with airline operations and arranged for medical personnel to meet the airplane at the gate. A post-accident review of weather records revealed that there were four pilot reports of moderate to severe turbulence from FL160 to FL250 in an area to the southwest of the accident location. A high-resolution rapid refresh numerical model computed for the time and location of the accident revealed that conditions were conducive for moderate clear air turbulence from FL250 to FL280. Infrared and visible satellite imagery depicted a transverse wave cloud pattern (often observed in turbulent conditions) over the accident area. The cloud temperatures were consistent with cloud tops near 33,000 ft above mean sea level.  A graphical Airmenâs Meteorological (G-AIRMET) information Tango (turbulence), issued by the National Weather Service, valid at the time of the accident advised of occasional moderate turbulence between FL180 and FL380 for much of the mid-Atlantic and northeast states. Graphic turbulence guidance products predicted areas of moderate turbulence over central Virginia moving northwest between 1300 and 1400 eastern standard time, at FL240.

The airline transport pilot, commercial pilot, and three passengers were fatally injured. The airplane was operated by SkyJet Elite under the provisions of Title 1 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 as a personal flight. According to a representative of the operator, the flight crew itinerary for the day was for the pilots to fly from Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International Airport (FLL), Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to HSP. The passengers planned to attend a conference in Hot Springs, while the flight crew were scheduled to continue to Teterboro Airport (TEB), Teterboro, New Jersey. According to the operatorâs trip itinerary, both flights were non-revenue 14 CFR Part 91 flights. According to preliminary Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) air traffic control audio recordings and automatic dependent surveillance - broadcast (ADS-B) flight track data, the flight departed FLL about 1246 and proceeded on course to HSP. About 1430, the flight crew checked in with Washington Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC). At that time, the airplane was about 60 miles south of HSP, at flight level 210 (21,000 ft). The controller instructed the flight crew to advise when they had the current weather and NOTAM information at HSP, and to advise of which instrument approach they wanted to utilize. The flight crew acknowledged the instruction. About 1432, the controller queried the flight crew again about which approach they wanted to conduct at HSP, and if they had the current weather and NOTAMs at the airport. The flight crew responded that they had received the weather conditions at HSP airport, but the information was about an hour old, and they further advised they wanted to fly the ILS approach to runway 25. The controller subsequently cleared the flight to AHLER intersection, which was an initial fix for the ILS approach to runway 25, located about 10 miles northeast of the airport. About 1433 to 1439, the controller provided 5Â° to 10Â° right of course headings as the flight continued to AHLER intersection. The controller also instructed the flight crew to confirm they had the current weather and NOTAMs at HSP. About 1441, the flight crew advised they had the current weather and NOTAMs. About 1444, the flight crew requested to descend from 7,000 ft mean sea level (msl) to 6,000 ft msl. The controller responded by clearing the flight direct to AHLER intersection for the ILS runway 25 approach and to cross AHLER at or above 6,100 ft msl. The flight crew read back the clearance and requested radar vectors for the approach, but subsequently followed up that they were proceeding direct to AHLER and cleared for the approach. About 1447, the flight crew advised that they would cancel their IFR (instrument flight rules) flight plan once on the ground at HSP with the flight service station. The controller advised that they could still contact the controller while on the ground, and they could cancel the flight plan directly with him. Subsequently, the controller advised that there was no traffic observed between their position and the airport and to switch to the common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF). The flight crew readback the instruction and no further radio communications were recorded between the controller and the flight crew. According to an HSP airport staff member who was monitoring the CTAF, shortly before the accident he heard two radio calls from an airplane announcing that they were conducting an approach to land on runway 25. Shortly thereafter, he heard the airplaneâs impact with terrain and turned to see smoke rising from the approach end of runway 25. The airplaneâs ADS-B flight track revealed that the airplane proceeded about 15 miles northeast of the airport to conduct the ILS approach to runway 25, commencing the approach at the AHLER intersection. The airplaneâs altitude descended along the final approach course to runway 25. The final recorded ADS-B position was about 200 ft from the initial impact point with terrain. The wreckage debris path was oriented on a 250Â° to 255Â° magnetic heading and spanned about 150 ft from the initial impact point to the main wreckage. The initial impact point coincided with several trees that were located along a down sloping ravine about 300 ft from the runway threshold. The wreckage was heavily fragmented and was thermally damaged during a postimpact fire. All primary flight control surfaces and major portions of the airplane were located at the accident site. The right main landing gear was the only major portion of the airplane to have been located next to runway 25; it was located about 315 ft forward of the fuselage and about 10 ft to the right of the runway edge. Flight control continuity could not be established from the cockpit to the flight controls due to the extensive impact damage, however; continuity was observed at the flight control surfaces that remained partially intact. The configuration of the airplane at the time of impact was assessed to be landing gear down and flaps set to 40Â° as measured by actuator and jackscrew positions. The left wing outboard spoiler was observed retracted and its actuator position corresponded to a retracted position. The right wing spoilers were not identifiable due to the impact and thermal damage. The impact and thermal damage sustained to the cockpit prevented any data collection of instrument readings or switch positions. Both engines were located in the debris field with heavy impact and thermal damage observed. The left engine had separated into two pieces and the right engine remained mostly intact. Both engine spinners exhibited varying degrees of rotational scoring signatures. Both engine fan blade sections exhibited leading edge tearing, gouging, and battering damage, and several fan blades were observed to be bent opposite the direction of engine rotation. Review of the Aviation Routine Weather Reports (METARs) at the airport found two reports issued, with one issued about 20 minutes before the accident and another report issued a few minutes after the accident. At 1435, the wind was 270Â° at 21 knots, gusting to 31 knots, visibility was 10 statute miles, and no ceiling was reported. At 1455, the wind was 280Â° at 19 knots, gusting to 38 knots, visibility was 10 statute miles, and scattered clouds were reported 2,000 ft above ground level (agl), broken clouds 2,400 ft agl, and an overcast ceiling at 4,500 ft agl. According to FAA airman and operator records, the pilot in command (PIC) held an airline transport pilot certificate and held a PIC type rating in the accident airplane that was issued on January 28, 2024. The PIC was issued a first-class medical certificate on December 19, 2023, the application for which reported 13,655 total flight hours. According to an operatorâs electronic pilot logbook, a total of 65 hours, of which 55 hours were PIC hours, had been logged in the accident airplane make and model. The PIC also held the position of Chief Pilot for the operator. The second in command (SIC) held a commercial pilot certificate, with airplane single, multiengine land, and instrument airplane ratings. The SIC was issued a first-class medical certificate on April 4, 2023. He was issued a SIC type rating in the accident airplane on November 20, 2023. According to an operatorâs electronic pilot logbook, he had logged a total of 1,068 flight hours, of which 136 hours were in the accident airplane make and model as SIC. The airplaneâs cockpit voice recorder (CVR) was located in the debris and was forwarded to the National Transportation Safety Board Vehicle Recorderâs Laboratory in Washington, DC. The wreckage was retained for further examination.METAR: METAR: At 14:35 LT: METAR KHSP 101835Z AUTO 27021G31KT 10SM M02/M09 A2965 RMK AO2 T10161090 PWINO At 14:55 LT: METAR KHSP 101855Z AUTO 28019G38KT 10SM SCT020 BKN024 OVC045 M02/M08 A2965 RMK AO2 T10221078 At 15:15 LT: METAR KHSP 101915Z AUTO 27019G33KT 10SM BKN020 BKN028 OVC038 M02/M09 A2966 RMK AO2 T10211087Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA24FA136 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: https://abcnews.go.com/US/twin-engine-plane-carrying-5-crashes-virginia-airport/story?id=107982625  https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/10/us/hot-springs-virginia-plane-crash/index.html  https://www.wdbj7.com/2024/03/10/plane-crashes-ingalls-field-airport/  https://www.wsls.com/news/local/2024/03/10/plane-crashes-at-airport-in-hot-springs/  https://wset.com/news/local/wreckage-no-longer-resembles-an-aircraft-ntsb-shares-details-about-deadly-plane-crash-ingalls-field-airport-bath-county-virginia-state-police-march-2024  NTSB  https://registry.faa.gov/AircraftInquiry/Search/NNumberResult?nNumberTxt=1125A  https://www.faa.gov/about/officeorg/headquartersoffices/avs/faa-certificated-aircraft-operators-legal-part-135-holders  https://globe.adsbexchange.com/?icao=a036a9  Location  Media:NTSB investigating Sunday's crash of an Israel Aircraft Industries 1125 Westwind Astra airplane near Hot Springs, Virginia.â NTSB Newsroom (@NTSB_Newsroom) March 10, 2024 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates10-Mar-2024 20:10 Captain Adam Added 10-Mar-2024 20:43 vasilf Updated [Aircraft type, Source, ]11-Mar-2024 06:07 RobertMB Updated [Time, Aircraft type, Registration, Cn, Operator, Total fatalities, Total occupants, Phase, Nature, Departure airport, Source, Embed code, Damage, Narrative, ]11-Mar-2024 06:16 ASN Updated [Embed code, Narrative, ]11-Mar-2024 06:44 Captain Adam Updated [Source, Narrative, Category, ]11-Mar-2024 15:00 Anon.

Southwest Airlines reported that their flight attendant jumpseat positions are as follows on the 737-800 aircraft: the A and C FA's are positioned in the forward galley and the B and D FA's are positioned in the aft galley. The flight crew reported that before the flight, the captain briefed the two forward galley position FAs to expect a ârough' ride after departure on the initial climb and that if smooth air was encountered it would not last long. He also informed them of a line of convective weather that they would need to deviate through, and that they should expect turbulence until they were well clear of that weather. Although the captain was not able to meet with the two aft galley FAs before departure, he was assured that the preflight briefing would be relayed to them. The flight crew reported that the climb and initial cruise flight was turbulent; however, they briefly experienced a smooth ride for about 20 minutes before the flight was expected to encounter another area of turbulence.   The captain stated that he had notified the FA's that if they got up, he wanted them in their seats at least five minutes before the expected turbulence and provided a specific time for them to be seated. After the brief smooth ride, the flight experienced the expected continuous light to moderate turbulence as the flight crew navigated through a line of convective weather.  The turbulence persisted longer than initially anticipated, so the captain called the FA's to advise them to expect continued turbulence. At this time, the captain was informed that the D position FA had injured herself by splashing a pot of coffee onto her head, face, and shoulders.  The B position FA reported that the captain had notified the FA's that the flight might encounter turbulence and to remain seated if the rough air materialized. Due to the smooth air encountered during the initial cruise portion of the flight, the FA's were able to quickly complete a passenger service and be reseated. The B position FA recalled that the captain had asked the FA's to take their seats before the second area of turbulence was encountered. The D position FA reported that she brewed a fresh pot of hot coffee for the passengers. After brewing the coffee, she picked up the coffee pot by its handle to pour a cup. However, at that moment, the aircraft encountered turbulence, causing the coffee pot to strike a handle near the coffee machine.  As a result, hot coffee splashed on her.   Upon being notified of the injury, the captain messaged dispatch via the aircraft communications addressing and reporting system and coordinated to have medical personnel meet the airplane upon arrival at the gate. The aircraft was met by paramedics who immediately transported the injured FA to a hospital where she was diagnosed with second degree burns.

While flying direct to KRVUR, the flight crew said that Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Air Traffic Control (ATC) gave the flight permission to descend to FL 310. As the airplane was descending, it approached some clouds that were visible in the moon light, and the captain activated the seat belt sign, and made a brief announcement as a precaution. The flight crew said that they then requested that ATC allow them to deviate to the left to avoid the highest cloud peaks that they could see, however at no time did the weather radar indicate any significant moisture returns.  The flight crew said they were unable to avoid entering the clouds and the flight briefly encountered âmoderateâ turbulence. As the flight exited those cloud tops, they then saw more clouds ahead, along with some indirect lightning nearby. The captain made an announcement to the cabin for the flight attendants (FAs) to take their jump seats, and about a minute later they entered the next set of cloud tops and experienced brief, but severe turbulence. The first officer (FO) said that the turbulence encounter lasted about 10 to 15 seconds with the altitude deviating a little, and the airplane rolling about 10 to 15 degrees. He also added that the auto throttle system, increased the thrust setting, which required that they reduce it manually.  After the turbulence event, the flight crew stated that they received a call from the cabin crew notifying them that a FA was injured. The injured FA stated that after completing cabin service they stowed the beverage carts in the back galley and within one minute of stowing the carts, they encountered âvery severeâ and unexpected turbulence. He said that the seatbelt sign was off, and he could not sit in the jump seats closest to him because they were all occupied by other flight attendants. He added that the flight was full and there were no passenger seats available as well, and the only available jump seats were far away. He said that as he reached to grab a handle near the carts he was suddenly thrown by the turbulence. He hit his head on the ceiling and came down on his right foot, resulting in a broken fibula.  After the turbulence ended the flight crew gathered more information from the cabin and made a pilot report (PIREP) to ATC indicating that there was an injured FA aboard and requested that emergency medical services personnel meet the airplane at the gate.  The first officer added that from his perspective, there was no indication of possible turbulence in the vicinity, and if it wasn't for the moon light making the clouds visible, the seat belt sign would most likely have not been activated, because the radar showed no reflection of moisture in the clouds. Probable Cause: An inadvertent encounter with convective turbulence that resulted in a serious injury to a flight attendant.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA24LA135 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=194001  https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/n6705y#34898192  https://www.flightaware.com/live/flight/DAL1253/history/20240328/0240Z/KATL/KTPA  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates28-Mar-2024 15:21 ASN Added 29-Mar-2024 10:28 ASN Updated [Time, Location, ]29-Mar-2024 10:29 ASN Updated [Category, ]17-May-2024 16:11 Captain Adam Updated [Time, Total occupants, Location, Source, Accident report, ]18-Jan-2025 13:07 Captain Adam Updated [Source, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

Of the 5 crew and 140 passengers onboard, one flight attendant and one passenger sustained serious injuries, and one flight attendant sustained minor injuries. The aircraft was not damaged. The flight was operating under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 as a scheduled passenger flight. The day of the accident, a major cold front was traversing the southeastern United States. The squall line of rapidly developing thunderstorms associated with the front extended south several hundred miles into the Gulf of Mexico. A convective Significant Meteorological Information (SIGMET) was issued at 1155 UTC for the area, warning pilots of cloud tops above 45,000 ft. A post-accident review of the weather showed a rapidly developing cell in the area of the accident consistent with the accident pilotsâ recollection described in the next paragraph. The captain stated that when he met with the flight attendants before departure and briefed them on the weather conditions, they agreed that, at the 10,000 ft chime, the flight attendants would decide amongst themselves if the ride was smooth enough to start their inflight service. The captain informed them that if the ride became too uncomfortable that they should take their jump seats and let the cockpit know that they were seated. As the aircraft climbed to altitude, the aircraft encountered occasional chop. They leveled the aircraft at flight level (FL) 370, above the weather system with the tops of the clouds at FL340 â FL350. The fasten seatbelt sign remained illuminated the entire flight. About 40 minutes into the flight and approaching the REMIS waypoint, the flight began to encounter light turbulence and the crew began deviations around cells before waypoint ROZZI. The visibility was intermittent instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) and marginal visual meteorological conditions (VMC) with occasional light chop. As they returned to their route to REMIS, the visibility improved and they visually acquired a rapidly developing cloud top that was on their flight path, but not painting on the onboard radar. The captain made a passenger announcement to ensure those in the cabin were seated and then contacted air traffic control (ATC) to request the deviation. The first officer (FO) began a right turn to avoid the cell, however, was not able to complete the turn in time and entered the cloud buildup. They encountered severe turbulence that lasted about 10 seconds that resulted in fluctuations up to 30Â°of bank, 20 knots airspeed, and 200 ft of altitude. Moderate turbulence followed for about 1 minute. According to flight data, vertical acceleration ranged from -0.45 gravitational force equivalent (g) to +1.8g during the turbulence encounter. Following the event, the flight crew coordinated with dispatch and decided to divert to Tampa International Airport (TPA), Tampa, Florida. They informed ATC of their intentions and were routed to TPA where they performed an uneventful landing, and medical personnel met the aircraft at the gate. The following NTSB specialists were assigned to investigate the accident: air traffic control, meteorology, and flight data recorder. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Southwest Airlines, and the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) are parties to the investigation. The flight data recorder data for the flight was downloaded by the operator and sent to NTSB headquarters for analysis. This analysis is ongoing. At the time of the encounter with turbulence, the aircraft was in Jacksonville (JAX) Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) airspace. While crew statements indicated they were aware of and monitoring rapidly developing cells, ATC audio indicated that the air traffic controller overseeing the flight did not provide specific information about the developing weather cell the aircraft penetrated to encounter the accident turbulence. NTSB investigators travelled to JAX ARTCC and conducted interviews of ATC personnel controlling the flight during the turbulence encounter. The investigation found that while the target number of aircraft for the sector was set at 20 (down from 23 due to increased complexity), the controller had significantly more aircraft on the frequency in the timeframe surrounding the accident. The controllerâs workload was further increased due to technical limitations with the temporary very high frequency (VHF) communications antenna the ARTCC was relying on to communicate with traffic after the primary VHF antenna was rendered inoperative in a fire in October 2023. FAA telecommunications infrastructure (FTI) had provided a satellite relay connection to assist with provision of operational frequencies, typically used in case of emergency situations. This caused a delay of transmission by 600 milliseconds round trip, resulting in clipped communication with a number of aircraft on the frequency. The controller described that these limitations required him to issue multiple repeated calls to multiple aircraft on the frequency increasing his workload and frequency congestion. The investigation is continuing.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA24FA143 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: https://www.kitv.com/news/national/passenger-flight-attendant-injured-during-severe-turbulence-on-southwest-flight/article_a9583e2a-1e0f-5752-8edc-fa72a4834b1e.html  NTSB  https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/n567wn#349dff56  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates04-Apr-2024 06:48 ASN Added 04-Apr-2024 06:48 ASN Updated [Aircraft type, ]04-Apr-2024 13:55 ASN Updated [Total occupants, Source, Narrative, ]17-May-2024 16:06 Captain Adam Updated [Time, Total occupants, Source, Narrative, Category, Accident report, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The captain reported he recognized the flight might encounter turbulence since he had encountered it on his previous flight. He stated that during the preflight briefing he informed the cabin crew to remain seated because they were expecting rough air, and it was a short flight. The captain reported that the departure and cruise segments of the flight were smooth and uneventful. On descent, around 14,000 feet, the aircraft encountered moderate turbulence before going into a cloud layer. Following the encounter, the first officer called the lead flight attendant (FA) to ensure everyone was ok while the captain asked air traffic control (ATC) for a right turn to avoid an approaching cloud buildup. The lead FA first reported that everything was ok, however shortly after the initial call, she called again to report that one of the FAs might have a broken leg. The injured FA stated that she was seated in the back of the aircraft and completing her last safety check when the turbulence lifted her out of her seat, and she landed forcefully on her right leg. Another flight attendant hit her head on the ceiling and fell, hurting her lower back. The captain transferred flight and communication duties to the first officer while the captain coordinated paramedics for the arrival into AVL. The captain then reported the turbulence to ATC and reassumed flight duty. The aircraft landed and arrived at the gate with no further issues. The paramedics met the airplane at the gate, and the seriously injured flight attendant was transported to the hospital and diagnosed with multiple fractures in her right leg. Post accident weather analysis suggested that the turbulence was likely caused by windshear associated with an upper front. A pilot from a different flight had reported moderate turbulence between 11,000 and 8,000 feet in a nearby area. However, there were no active advisories for turbulence in the location where the accident aircraft encountered turbulence. Probable Cause: An encounter with clear air turbulence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA24LA144 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=194029  https://www.flightaware.com/live/flight/N899AT/history/20240403/0255Z/KATL/KAVL/tracklog  https://www.flightaware.com/live/flight/N899AT/history/20240403/1010Z/KAVL/KATL  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates29-Apr-2024 12:59 ASN Added 29-Apr-2024 13:00 ASN Updated [Departure airport, Destination airport, Narrative, ]29-Apr-2024 13:00 ASN Updated 17-May-2024 15:59 Captain Adam Updated [Time, Total occupants, Location, Phase, Departure airport, Destination airport, Narrative, Category, Accident report, ]16-Oct-2024 16:54 Captain Adam Updated [Source, Narrative, ]21-Oct-2024 08:29 ASN Updated [Accident report, ] Corrections or additions? ...

There were no injuries. The first officer (FO) was the pilot flying and the captain was the pilot monitoring on the flight. The flight crew had initially planned and set up for landing on runway 17L, but just before the descent, they were informed that the active runway had changed to runway 35R. They briefed the area navigation (required navigation performance) (RNAV [RNP]) Y approach for runway 35R before the descent. The approach was typical, with light turbulence in the descent. At approximately 6100 feet ASL, the landing gear was extended, flaps were set to 15Â°, and the propellers were set to 1020 rpm for landing. The approach speed was established at 132 knots indicated airspeed. The surface winds were reported to be from 330Â° at 10 knots, gusting to 20 knots. No additive for the gust was made to the approach speed. The autopilot was turned off at 500 feet above ground level (AGL) and the remainder of the approach was hand flown by the FO. From 500 feet AGL to touchdown, the power levers were adjusted up and down 12 times between 22% torque and 4% torque. Once below 350 feet AGL on approach, the aircraftâs descent path varied above and below the 3Â° approach descent path. During this time, the captain made 3 calls to the FO to increase power. The FO responded by increasing power each time; however, the last increase in power was quickly followed by a reduction in power to 4% torque. The aircraft crossed the runway 35R threshold at 65 feet AGL. Over the next 6 seconds, the aircraft experienced a performance-degrading wind gust with an approximate speed of 8 knots. The FO began to increase the nose-up attitude to start the flare, slowing the aircraft to 120 knots calibrated airspeed. Two seconds before touchdown, the pitch attitude increased from 5Â° to 8.3Â° and the power levers were advanced.

According to the pilots, a pilot-in-command proficiency check flight was being conducted, with a designated pilot examiner utilizing the flight deck jump seat. Prior to performing a simulated single engine approach to runway 17 at Ravalli County Airport (HRF), Hamilton, Montana, the pilot in command (PIC) noticed that the hydraulic reservoir display was âat the bottom limit in the yellow arc.â All pre-landing checklist items were completed, including brake function checks.  After landing on runway 17, during the landing roll, the airplane began to veer right of centerline, and the PIC added left rudder correction. A vibration developed and increased as the airplane continued to veer to the right. Despite the PICâs application of left brake and additional rudder inputs, the airplane continued to veer right, exited the runway, and struck a runway light, taxiway light and taxiway sign.  Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that the right stub wing bulkhead was substantially damaged.

The two pilots were fatally injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 flight.  The accident airplane, owned and operated by Alaska Air Fuel, Inc., was transporting 3,400 gallons of unleaded fuel and two 100-gallon propane tanks. The airplane departed from the Fairbanks International Airport (FAI) at about 0955 Alaska daylight time (AKDT) with a destination of the Kobuk Airport (OBU) Kobuk, Alaska. Shortly after takeoff an eyewitness reported seeing the airplane flying to the west, with the far left engine (No. 1) not running. The witness also noticed a small, white plume of smoke coming from that engine. The witness reported the airplane began a turn to the south at which point he noticed the engine was on fire. Recovered surveillance video shows white smoke behind the number one engine, followed by flames. The video also revealed that seconds later a bright white explosion is seen just behind the number one engine followed by fragments of airplane wreckage falling to the ground. The airplane then begins an uncontrolled descending left turn into terrain. The No. 1 engine separated from the wing about 100 ft above the ground and eventually came to rest on the frozen Tanana River.  A preliminary review of archived voice communication information from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) revealed that shortly after departure from FAI at 1,000, the pilot contacted the departure air traffic control (ATC) specialist on duty, stating that there was âa fire on boardâ and that they needed to return to the airport.  The accident airplane was equipped with Automatic Dependent SurveillanceâBroadcast (ADSâ B), which provides aircraft position information via satellite navigation or other sensors and periodically broadcasts it, enabling the aircraft to be tracked. The information can be received by air traffic control ground stations as a replacement for secondary surveillance radar, as no interrogation signal is needed from the ground. According to archived FAA ADS-B data, after the airplane departed FAI, it initially proceeded southwest, then it turned westbound. The airplane then began a left turn back to FAI. The ADSB data eventually stopped near where the witness observed the accident airplane impact terrain.  The accident airplane was also equipped was Spidertracks. Spidertracks enables real-time flight tracking, automated flight watch, two-way communication, and flight data monitoring (FDM) for aircraft. The operatorâs archived Spidertracks data has been collected for further analysis.  A large postcrash fire ensued, which incinerated much of the airplane's structure. The No.1 engine was recovered, and a detailed engine examination is pending.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ANC24FA029 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/douglas-dc-4-plane-crash-fairbanks-alaska/  https://alaskapublic.org/2024/04/23/rescuers-responding-to-plane-crash-along-tanana-river-near-fairbanks/  https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/plane-crash-fairbanks-alaska-rescue-b2533569.html  https://abc7news.com/alaska-news-pilot-reported-fire-onboard-plane-carrying-fuel-attempted-to-return-fairbanks-just-before-crash/14729111/?ex_cid=TA_KGO_TW&taid=6629e363029dc600017ab569  NTSB  https://registry.faa.gov/AircraftInquiry/Search/NNumberResult?nNumberTxt=N3054V  https://www.flightaware.com/live/flight/N3054V/history/20240423/1816Z/PAFA/L%2064.74248%20-148.08014~  https://cdn.jetphotos.com/full/5/2935864_1688407807.jpg (photo) History of this aircraft Ex N76AU, N62296, US Navy Bu:91994, Royal Air Force KL977, USAAF 42-72442 Location  Images: N3054V at Wasilla, June 2023; photo: King Hui (CC:by-sa) Media:A Douglas C-54 operated by Alaska Air Fuel, was destroyed when it crashed into a hill on the bank of the Tanana River, about six minutes after takeoff from Fairbanks International Airport, Alaska.

Hobby Airport (HOU/KHOU), Houston, TX -   United States of America","Landing","Passenger - Scheduled","Dallas-Love Field, TX (DAL/KDAL)","Houston-William P. Hobby Airport, TX (HOU/KHOU)"," NTSB","Information verified through data from accident investigation authorities","On May 3, 2024, about 1800 central daylight time (CDT), Delux Public Charter, doing business as JSX flight 284, an Embraer EMB-145LR experienced a left main landing gear (LMLG) collapse during landing at Houston Hobby International Airport (HOU), Houston, Texas. Of the 3 crew and 21 passengers onboard, one crew member sustained minor injuries. The aircraft was substantially damaged. The flight was a public charter sold by JSX, as the charter operator (subject to provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 380) and operated by Delux Public Charter, LLC as the direct air carrier (operating under the provisions of Title 14 CFR Part 135) as a nonscheduled passenger flight from Dallas Love Field airport (DAL), Dallas, Texas to HOU. The flight crew described an uneventful takeoff, climb, cruise, and descent. The flight data indicated the airspeed, vertical speed, and glide path were stabilized during the majority of the final approach. Surface winds during the approach at HOU were reported from 130 degrees at 16 knots, gusting to 24 knots. As the aircraft flew over the threshold of runway 4 at HOU, the flight crew described a feeling that there was something wrong, and the captain, who was the pilot flying, called for a go-around. The aircraft landed hard shortly thereafter. While the crew did not recall initiating the go-around, flight data showed an increase in throttle lever angle consistent with commanding go-around thrust that began shortly before impact. Flight data indicated that the vertical load factor during the touchdown was 3.9 gravitational constants (g). As the aircraft continued down the runway, the LMLG collapsed and punctured through the left-wing upper skin. The aircraft came to a stop on the left side of the runway about 567 ft from the end. Emergency personnel responded to the accident and assisted the passengers as they deplaned through the main cabin door (L1). The first officer was transported to a local hospital for minor injuries. Visual inspection of the LMLG showed structural damage and deformation, in addition to hydraulic fluid leakage. The left wing spar III, a principal structural element, was bent and fractured through at 2 locations and partially fractured at 3 additional locations. While there was damage to some of the left wingâs structural components, the fuel tank was not compromised during the event. Most of the structural damage to the inboard section of the wing was consistent with a strong upward force from the LMLG. Damage to the outboard section of the wing was consistent with the wing scraping the runway surface and impacting runway lights. The following NTSB specialists were assigned to investigate the accident: Airworthiness, Operations, Human Performance, Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR), and Flight Data Recorder (FDR). The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Delux Public Charter are parties to the investigation. The airplane was designed and manufactured in Brazil, and pursuant to International Civil Aviation Organization Annex 13, Centro de InvestigaÃ§Ã£o e PrevenÃ§Ã£o de Acidentes AeronÃ¡uticos (CENIPA) assigned an Accredited Representative to the investigation and designated Embraer as a technical advisor. The CVR and FDR were removed from the aircraft by NTSB investigators and were shipped to NTSB headquarters in Washington, DC where they were successfully downloaded. The aircraft wreckage was documented during the on-scene portion of the investigation and flight crew interviews were conducted via video conference on May 5, 2024.  The investigation continues.METAR: KHOU 032353Z 13009KT 10SM BKN100 BKN250 26/20 A2984 RMK AO2 SLP111 60006 T02560200 10272 20239 56019 KHOU 032253Z 13016G24KT 10SM SCT100 BKN250 26/20 A2985 RMK AO2 SLP112 T02610200Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA24FA179 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: https://www.fox26houston.com/news/small-plane-at-hobby-airport-has-landing-gear-collapse  https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/n942jx#350dbd1e  NTSB  Location  Media: Plane safely arrives at Hobby Airport after experiencing landing gear collapse, officials say https://t.co/aUEl12GKegâ ABC13 Houston (@abc13houston) May 4, 2024 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates04-May-2024 05:24 gerard57 Added 04-May-2024 06:27 ASN Updated [Aircraft type, Registration, Cn, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, ]04-May-2024 06:29 ASN Updated [Time, Location, Narrative, ]04-May-2024 06:31 ASN Updated [Embed code, ]04-May-2024 16:00 Aerossurance Updated [Embed code, ]05-May-2024 13:32 Captain Adam Updated [Location, Embed code, Damage, Narrative, Category, ]18-Jun-2024 23:00 Captain Adam Updated [Time, Source, Narrative, Accident report, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The eight occupants perished. Flighttracking data suggests that the aircraft entered a steep left descent from an altitude of about 10000 feet. The last data point shows an average rate of about -18000 fpm.  Investigators found that the Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS) was not available at the Maracaibo Airport Control Tower and not Aeronautical Meteorology Office was present at the Maracaibo Airport. After takeoff, the pilot did not continue the departure route authorized by the Air Traffic Controller, which was through the reporting point MAUROA 1, and requested a deviation to the north, heading directly into adverse weather conditions.

One passenger died, 30 other occupants suffered injuries requiring hospital treatment.  At 07:49:21 UTC the aircraft was passing over the south of Myanmar at 37,000 ft and likely flying over an area of developing convective activity. The Gravitational force (G), recorded as vertical accelerations, fluctuated between positive (+ve) 0.44G and +ve 1.57G for a period of about 19 seconds. This would have caused the flight to begin to experience slight vibration. Around the same time as the onset of the slight vibration, an uncommanded increase in aircraft altitude, reaching a peak of 37,362 ft, was recorded. In response to this uncommanded altitude increase, the autopilot pitched the aircraft downwards to descend back to the selected altitude of 37,000 ft.  In addition, the pilots observed an uncommanded increase in airspeed which they arrested by extending the speed brakes. While managing the airspeed, at 07:49:32 hr, it was heard that a pilot called out that the fasten seat belt sign had been switched on. This uncommanded increase in aircraft altitude and airspeed were most likely due to the aircraft being acted upon by an updraft (the upward movement of air). The autopilot was engaged during this period.  At 07:49:40 hr, the aircraft experienced a rapid change in G as recorded vertical acceleration decreased from +ve 1.35G to negative (-ve) 1.5G, within 0.6 sec. This likely resulted in the occupants who were not belted up to become airborne. At 07:49:41 hr, the vertical acceleration changed from -ve 1.5G to +ve 1.5G within 4 sec. This likely resulted in the occupants who were airborne to fall back down. The rapid changes in G over the 4.6 sec duration resulted in an altitude drop of 178 ft, from 37,362 ft to 37,184 ft. This sequence of events likely caused the injuries to the crew and passengers. In the midst of the sequence of rapid changes in G, recorded data indicated that the pilots initiated control inputs to stabilise the aircraft, disengaging the autopilot in this process. The pilots manually controlled the aircraft for 21 sec and reengaged the autopilot at 07:50:05 hr. The recorded vertical acceleration showed more gradual fluctuations over the next 24 sec, ranging from +ve 0.9G to +ve 1.1G, while the aircraft returned to 37,000 ft at 07:50:23 hr. After the pilots were informed by the cabin crew that there were injured passengers in the cabin, the decision was made to divert to Suvarnabhumi Airport, Bangkok, Thailand. On the way to Bangkok, the pilots requested for medical services to meet the aircraft on arrival. Approximately 17 minutes after the turbulence event, at 08:06:51 hr, the pilots initiated a normal, controlled descent from 37,000 ft and the aircraft reached 31,000 ft at 08:10:00 hr. The data showed that the aircraft did not encounter further severe turbulence during this diversion, and touched down in Suvarnabhumi Airport at 08:45:12 hr.Sources: https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/9v-swm#354eb60f  https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fsingaporeair%2Fposts%2Fpfbid01ETziy2xcUF8R5CKeg8CoKsqHsVHhhhw5Cp9UxvefpWmzCetfit82Xa2nUQ8LqVVl&show_text=true&width=500&is_preview=true  https://www.mot.gov.sg/news/details/transport-safety-investigation-bureau-preliminary-investigation-findings-of-incident-involving-sq321  Location  Media:Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates21-May-2024 11:32 TomPouce67 Added 21-May-2024 11:34 ASN Updated [Aircraft type, Cn, Operator, Source, Embed code, ]21-May-2024 11:36 ASN Updated [Narrative, ]21-May-2024 15:36 ASN Updated [Time, Location, Country, Narrative, Category, ]29-May-2024 16:13 ASN Updated [Source, Damage, Narrative, ]30-Dec-2024 16:33 Anon.

The aircraft departed Mzuzu Airport (ZZU) at 07:04  local time, and arrived at Lilongwe Airport (LLW) at 07:52.  The airplane was refuelled and the six passengers, among them the Vice President of Malawi, boarded the aircraft. The flight took off from LLW at 09:16 and received climb clearance to FL90. Later, the flight crew requested to maintain 7,000 ft AMSL. At about 09:23 the airplane reached a cruise level of about 7,300 ft (GPS altitude). At 09:50 hrs the aircraft began to deviate from the direct course to ZZU by entering a left-hand turn. From  then on the flight followed an erratic course at varying altitudes and several 360 degree turns. At 10:12 hrs, the flight crew had reported in on the Mzuzu Tower frequency and informed him that they were 20 NM away and intended an approach from the north. The Flight Information Officer communicated the weather information and that runway 17 was in use. He also informed them about his observation that east, south and west of the airport visibility was about 5 km.  Four minutes later the aircraft impacted a hillside, 34 km (18 NM) south-west of ZZU. First, the aircraft collided with the trunk of a tree with the outer part of the right wing at a height of about 4.5 m above ground. The airplaneâs lower fuselage surface then impacted the ground and the aircraft broke up until the main wreckage had come to rest on the slope about 80 m from the tree.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BFU Report number: BFU24-0508-DX Status: Preliminary reportDuration: 2 monthsDownload report:  Preliminary report Sources: https://mwnation.com/veep-chilimas-plane-goes-missing/  https://www.nyasatimes.com/teary-malawians-wait-with-unabated-breath-as-rescue-mission-continue-to-search-for-chilimas-missing-aircraft/  https://www.faceofmalawi.com/2024/06/11/chilima-dies-in-plane-crash/  https://malawi24.com/2024/06/11/chilima-crash-site-identified/  https://www.maravipost.com/tragic-malawi-veep-saulos-chilima-nine-others-die-in-plane-crash/  https://www.maravipost.com/mdf-confirms-chilimas-plane-crashed-in-chikangawa-forest/  https://www.africanews.com/2024/06/12/malawi-announces-state-funeral-and-21-days-of-mourning-for-vice-president-killed-in-a-plan/  https://www.bfu-web.de/DE/Home/Nachrichten/100724_Untersuchung_Malawi.html  https://www.scramble.nl/database/civil/details/do228_153  https://imgproc.airliners.net/photos/airliners/3/0/3/1096303.jpg (photo)  Images: Photo: BFU Media:Imaged below showing The missing plane in chikangawa forest..#breakingnews #malawi #missingplane #MbuziTvMw pic.twitter.com/zwXoTwJ9RDâ MbuziTv (@MbuziTvMw) June 11, 2024 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates10-Jun-2024 16:23 4Holerpoler Added 10-Jun-2024 16:25 ASN Updated [Aircraft type, Total fatalities, Location, Source, Damage, Narrative, ]10-Jun-2024 17:32 Ephata Updated [Country, ]11-Jun-2024 05:35 lagi Updated [Aircraft type, Registration, Cn, Source, Embed code, Narrative, ]11-Jun-2024 07:45 lagi Updated [Registration, Source, ]11-Jun-2024 09:54 Iceman 29 Updated [Total fatalities, Source, Embed code, Damage, ]11-Jun-2024 12:32 Rod K Updated [Embed code, Narrative, ]11-Jun-2024 14:12 lagi Updated [Location, Source, Embed code, Narrative, ]21-Jun-2024 08:40 luca Updated [Total fatalities, Total occupants, Source, Narrative, ]13-Jul-2024 14:20 ASN Updated [Source, Narrative, Photo, ]30-Aug-2024 11:24 ASN Updated [Time, Accident report, ]30-Aug-2024 16:33 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

On final approach to runway 19 the aircraft collided with a snow barrier 955 m short of the runway. It then touched down at 2.2 G with the left wing impacting the snow barrier. The aircraft swung and came to rest with the fuselage broken in two. The pilot-in-command, co-pilot and a passenger were seriously injured. Meteorological conditions at the time of the incident: visibility 2400 m, significant cloud haze 90 m, wind 8 m/s. Passengers were evacuated to the airport terminal building. The PIC, co-pilot and passenger (woman) were provided with medical assistance.  Utrenny Airport was constructed to allow shift workers to be flown to the Arctic LNG 2 project. Conclusion:  The aviation accident involving the An-26-100 RA-26662 aircraft occurred during the day, during an approach for landing in meteorological conditions below the established minimum operational limit of the airport. This resulted in the aircraft landing approximately 955 meters short of the runway threshold and colliding with a snow barrier.  Contributing factors included:  - The decision by the flight commander to continue the flight to the destination airport and to execute the landing approach, despite having information about meteorological conditions at the destination airport below the established operational minimum; - The crew's failure to maintain flight parameters that meet the criteria for a stabilized approach to landing, as well as their failure to go around when these were not met; - Descending below the established minimum descent altitude (MDA/H) with insufficient visual contact with ground landmarks necessary for making a landing decision; - The flight commander's (crew's) error in recognizing the runway and its landmarks; - Breakdowns in coordination, as well as insufficient crew resource management by the flight commander.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: https://t.me/aviaincident/32263  https://t.me/uraltransprok/5553  https://t.me/aviatorshina/4787  https://mak-iac.org/rassledovaniya/an-26-100-ra-26662-14-06-2024/  Preliminary Report: https://mak-iac.org/upload/iblock/bc9/8phss16w68qia8547ra6mt64nrxs49wi/pr_report_ra-26662.pdf  Final Report: https://mak-iac.org/upload/iblock/ff4/0dbgek9yrtmpufli1gaknx9e20pjn1mm/report_ra-26662.pdf   Location  Images: Photo: Ural Transport Prosecutor's Office Photo: MAK Media:#BREAKING ð·ðºâï¸| Russian An-26-100 made an emergency landing in Yamal.

While at cruise altitude, the Pilot Flying (the captain) briefed the area navigation global navigation satellite system (RNAV [GNSS]) Z approach to Runway 27. Based on the landing weight and the flaps set at 15Â°, the planned target landing reference speed (VREF) was 124 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS), and the flight crew added a 10-knot buffer, increasing the planned approach speed to 134 KIAS. At 1356, the flight was cleared to land, and the control tower reported the winds to be from 350Â° magnetic at 11 knots. At 13:59:30, when the aircraft was 267 feet above touchdown zone elevation (TDZE), the PF disconnected the autopilot and began to fly the approach manually. When the aircraft was 135 feet above the TDZE, the aircraft was travelling at 126 KIAS, the descent rate was 700 fpm, and the pitch was 3.2Â°. When the aircraft was 20 feet above the TDZE, it was travelling at 124 KIAS, the descent rate had increased to 980 fpm, and the pitch was 1.1Â°. The headwind component decreased from 5.5 knots to 0.5 knots within 3 seconds, increasing the maximum descent rate to 1050 fpm. In response, over a period of 2 seconds, the PF increased the pitch from 1.1Â° to 6.8Â°. The power was consistently at 14% torque. At 13:59:53, the right main landing gear contacted the runway, followed by the left main landing gear. A vertical acceleration of 3.51 g was recorded. After the initial contact with the runway, the aircraft bounced, and the flight crew initiated a go-around in accordance with Porter Airlinesâ standard operating procedures (SOPs). Two seconds later, a second runway contact occurred with a recorded vertical acceleration of 1.42 g. After the first touchdown, the TOUCHED RUNWAY warning light illuminated, indicating that a sensor near the tail section of the aircraft had been triggered by contact with the runway surface. In addition, the master warning light started flashing. During the climbout, the flight crew noticed the master warning and TOUCHED RUNWAY warning lights; however, they did not discuss the issue further at that time. The flight crew were cleared by the tower controller to conduct a visual flight rules circuit and return to land. The aircraft landed uneventfully at 1408, and the flight crew taxied the aircraft to the apron and shut it down. Damage to the lower portion of the aft fuselage section was identified and company flight operations personnel were notified.METAR: CYFC 281600Z AUTO 33015G20KT 9SM SCT066 SCT075 21/07 A2996 RMK SLP147 DENSITY ALT 700FT CYFC 281700Z AUTO 32014KT 9SM BKN071 BKN080 21/10 A2997 RMK SLP152 DENSITY ALT 800FT CYFC 281800Z AUTO 30009G16KT 9SM FEW066 21/08 A2998 RMK SLP153 DENSITY ALT 800FTAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A24A0038 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: https://www.reddit.com/r/rampagent/comments/1dqps00/just_witnessed_my_first_q400_tail_strike_at_work/  https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/c-glqp#35e5e56a Media:A Porter Airlines Dash 8-400 damaged following a tail-strike while landing at Fredericton Airport, Canada.Photo: Respective OwnerTelegram Channel: https://t.co/KUkXqwLO2W pic.twitter.com/XipAlwvw8vâ AviatorsMaldives (@AviatorsMaldive) June 29, 2024 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates03-Jul-2024 05:34 ASN Added 03-Jul-2024 05:35 ASN Updated [Location, Embed code, Narrative, ]16-Jul-2024 14:08 ASN Updated [Total occupants, Damage, Narrative, ]06-Feb-2025 15:25 ASN Updated [Narrative, Accident report, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The pilot landed the airplane on the grooved asphalt runway and observed that there was no standing water. During the landing roll, the airplane encountered heavy rain and the pilot stated that it began âhydroplaningâ toward the right side of the runway. The right wing of the airplane then impacted 3 edge lights and one location sign before the pilot was able to regain control and then taxi off the runway and to the ramp. The airplaneâs right wing was substantially damaged during the accident sequence. The pilot stated that there preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures of the airplane that would have precluded normal operation. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that there was no evidence of tread rubber reversion on either main landing gear tire that would be associated with hydroplaning during landing.

The airplane landed on runway 28L at PDX without further incident, and all occupants (2 flight crewmembers, 4 cabin crewmembers, and 171 passengers) deplaned at the gate. Seven passengers and one flight attendant received minor injuries. The flight was operated under Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 121 as a scheduled domestic passenger flight from PDX to Ontario, California (ONT). âââ â The separation of the MED plug from the airplane adversely affected the pressurization performance of the airplane and the damage to the MED plug adversely affected its structural strength, requiring replacement of the MED plug, resulting in a classification of substantial damage in accordance with Title 49 CFR Part 830. Both flight crewmembers held airline transport pilot (ATP) certificates. The captain had accumulated about 12,700 hours of flight experience, of which about 6,500 were in the accident airplane make and model. The first officer (FO) had accumulated about 8,300 hours total flight experience, of which about 1,500 were in the accident airplane make and model. The captain was the pilot flying and the FO was the pilot monitoring. The flight crew stated that the preflight inspection, engine start, taxi, takeoff, and departure climb were unremarkable. After takeoff, the flight crew checked in with Seattle Air Route Traffic Control Center and was cleared to flight level (FL)230 [23,000 feet]. The captain said that, while climbing through about 16,000 ft, there was a loud bang. The flight crew said their ears popped, and the captain said his head was pushed into the heads-up display (HUD) and his headset was pushed up, nearly falling off his head. The FO said her headset was completely removed due to the rapid outflow of air from the flight deck. Both flight crew said they immediately donned their oxygen masks. They added that the flight deck door was blown open and that it was very noisy and difficult to communicate. The flight crew immediately contacted air traffic control (ATC), declared an emergency, and requested a lower altitude. The flight was assigned 10,000 ft. The captain said he then requested the rapid decompression checklist, and the FO executed the required checklist from the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH). As the FO completed the checklist, the captain flew the airplane as they coordinated with ATC to return to the PDX airport. The flight landed on runway 28L without further incident and taxied to the gate. The CVR and FDR were removed from the airplane and brought to the NTSBâs Vehicle Recorder Laboratory in Washington, DC, for download of the data. The accident airplane was required to be equipped with a CVR that retained, at minimum, the last 2 hours of audio information, including flight crew communications and other sounds inside the cockpit. A CVR starts recording when the aircraft is powered on and will continue to record until the aircraft is powered down or the CVR is deactivated, either by a loss of electrical power after a major event or by manually deactivating the CVRâs circuit breaker after a less severe event. The CVR was downloaded successfully; however, it was determined that the audio from the accident flight had been overwritten. The CVR circuit breaker had not been manually deactivated after the airplane landed following the accident in time to preserve the accident flight recording. The accident airplane was required to be equipped with an FDR that recorded, at a minimum, 91 parameters and 25 hours of data. The accident airplaneâs FDR was successfully downloaded and had about 1800 parameters and was 68 hours in length. It contained 16.5 flights, and the oldest recorded flight was from December 30, 2023. A summary of the FDR data is as follows: o 17:06:47 PST: The airplane departed runway 28L at PDX. o 17:12:33 PST: The recorded cabin pressure dropped from 14.09 to 11.64 pounds per square inch (psi) when the airplane was at an altitude of about 14,830 ft and speed of 271 knots (kts). The âCabin Altitude Greater than (>) 10k ft Warningâ activated. Differential pressure was at 5.7 psi and rapidly decreased to 0 psi over the next few seconds o 17:12:34 PST: The Master Caution activated. The cabin pressure dropped to 9.08 psi at approximately 14,850 ft and 271 kts. The airplane magnetic heading was 123Â°. o 17:12:52 PST: The Master Caution deactivated. o 17:13:41 PST: The airplane continued to climb and reached a maximum altitude of 16,320 ft and began to descend. The airspeed was 276 kts on a magnetic heading of 120Â°. o 17:13:56 PST: The Selected Altitude changed from 23,000 ft to 10,000 ft. o 17:14:35 PST: The Master Caution activated for 3 seconds. o 17:16:56 PST: The airplane began a left turn from 121Â°. The altitude was approximately 10,120 ft. o 17:17:00 PST: The airplane descended below 10,000 ft. o 17:18:05 PST: The airplane altitude was approximately 9,050 ft and the airspeed was 271 kts. The âCabin Altitude Greater than (>) 10k ft Warningâ deactivated. The cabin pressure was 10.48 psi. o 17:26:46 PST: The airplane landed on runway 28L at PDX.  The airplane was equipped with a MED plug option, which Alaska Airlines had selected based on its desired seating configuration. Benefits afforded by the plug option include: 1. More passenger comfort because of the lower density of passengers and thus passengers having more space. 2. Reduced weight (63 lbs vs 150 lbs for the door configuration) and associated cost savings in operating the airplane. 3. A full-sized passenger window. 4. A structural component that does not have the complexity of a door with its associated parts, operations, and maintenance concerns. The accident airplane was equipped with 178 passenger seats, of which rows 1 through 4 were first class, rows 6 through 9 were premium seats, and rows 10 through 34 were economy class. The MED plugs, with a standard window each, were located at row 26 on the right and left sides of the airplane. Each door plug was about 29 inches wide and 59 inches high. The accident MED plug was manufactured by Spirit AeroSystems Malaysia on March 24, 2023, and was received at Spirit AeroSystems Wichita on May 10, 2023. The MED plug was then installed and rigged on the fuselage (Spirit AeroSystems Fuselage Line 8789) before it was shipped to Boeing on August 20, 2023. The fuselage arrived at Boeingâs Renton, Washington, facility on August 31, 2023. The MED plug is primarily constructed of aluminum and is installed in the fuselage by means of two upper guide fittings and two lower hinge fittings. The two upper guide fittings are located on the upper sides of the plug and engage with two upper guide rollers that are fixed to the upper sides of the fuselage opening. Two lower hinge guide fittings are fixed to the lower section of the plug and engage with the two lower hinge fittings that are attached to the bottom of the fuselage opening at the lower hinge bracket assemblies. Once the plug is in place, it is secured from moving vertically by a total of four bolts. There is a bolt installed through each upper guide fitting and each lower hinge guide fitting. Once these bolts are installed, they are secured using castle nuts and cotter pins. Outboard motion of the plug is prevented by 12 stop fittings (6 along each forward and aft edge) installed on the fuselage door frame structure. The door plug is only intended to be opened for maintenance and inspection, which requires removing the vertical movement arrestor bolts and upper guide track bolts. The strap assemblies below the second stop pad from the top restrict the plug from opening further than 15Â°, suitable for maintenance and inspection purposes. The NTSBâs investigative team conducted a postaccident examination of the aircraft structure, flight deck, cabin interior, cabin safety systems, and pressurization system. The cabin pressurization system maintains a safe, comfortable cabin pressure altitude and, under normal operations, the maximum cabin pressure altitude is around 8,000 ft. A postaccident review of cabin pressure/cabin altitude data before the decompression event showed that the cabin pressure control system had functioned per design with no cabin altitude or cabin rate exceedances. However, the NTSBâs examination of the airplaneâs maintenance logs identified entries indicating that a pressure controller light had illuminated on three previous flights. Pressurization on the 737-9 is managed by a triple-redundant system with two automated pressure controllers and a manual back-up system. An issue with one controller prompts the system to switch to the alternate controller automatically. If both automated pressure controllers fail, a manual back-up system can be used, which is operated by the pilots. Any one of these three systems is fully capable of maintaining safe cabin pressurization. To ensure a complete study of the pressurization system, the NTSB retained the two cabin pressure controllers and the outflow valve for further study. When the rapid decompression occurred, all flight attendant and passenger oxygen masks immediately deployed. Examination revealed that the masksâ associated chemical generators operated as designed and produced oxygen for the airplane occupants. In addition, the examination included cabin communications and lighting systems, emergency equipment, passenger safety information, the flight deck door, aircraft exits, and the condition of the cabin interior to include all seats, seat tracks, windows, doors, and interior paneling. The flight crew reported that the cockpit door had opened during the depressurization event. In a revision to the Flight Crew Operations Manual, issued on January 15, 2024, Boeing confirmed that the door functioned as designed. Damage to the passenger cabin included: damage in seat rows 25ABC and 26ABC as described below, deformation of the doorframe of the forward lavatory, and buckling and displacement of the sidewall panels and trim throughout the airplane. There were no indications of any other failures or malfunction of the airplane or any of its systems. Seat 25A was rotated out and aft approximately 10Â°â20Â° toward the opening. The seatback of Seat 26A was rotated forward and outboard.  The NTSB Structures and Materials specialists, along with representatives from parties to the investigation, examined the MED plug and associated components removed from the accident airplane. The MED plug was mostly intact with some damage from the event and appeared to be manufactured in accordance with the engineering drawings. The two vertical movement arrestor bolts, two upper guide track bolts, forward lower hinge guide fitting, and forward lift assist spring were missing and have not been recovered. Contact damage was noted on the lower sides of the 12 stop pins and fittings on the MED plug. Corresponding contact damage was noted on the 12 stop pads and fittings attached to the fuselage. Overall, the damage was consistent with the MED plug translating upward, outboard, and aft during the separation. Both upper guide fittings installed on the forward and aft sides of the MED plug, respectively, were fractured vertically through the inboard wall of the track. Examination revealed features consistent with overstress fracture and no evidence of pre-existing cracks or damage. The outboard upper guide track bolt holes were intact and exhibited no deformation. The paint in the upper guide track bolt hole bores was intact and showed no evidence of heavy contact damage. There were some light circular witness marks around the hole bores consistent with the presence of a washer at some time. The aft lower hinge guide fitting fractured from the MED plug during the event and remained attached to the aft hinge fitting. The forward lower hinge guide fitting fractured from the MED plug and separated from the forward hinge fitting. The forward hinge fitting shaft was bent inboard about 0.4Â° with corresponding contact damage noted to the MED plug lower beam. The vertical movement arrestor bolt hole bore in the forward hinge fitting was intact and undamaged. The aft hinge fitting was bent inboard about 3.7Â° with corresponding contact damage noted to the MED plug lower beam. Contact damage was noted on the inboard side of the hinge fitting shaft intersecting the vertical movement arrestor bolt hole consistent with contact with the MED plug, but the hole bore was otherwise undamaged. The outboard side of the vertical movement arrestor bolt hole was slightly elongated and exhibited small tensile cracks at the apex of the bend consistent with plastic deformation of the hinge fitting shaft. The hole bore was otherwise undamaged. The attachment flange on the aft lower hinge guide fitting was fractured at the two upper attach hole locations, and the bolts remained installed in the MED plug. The two lower attach bolts were fractured. A similar damage pattern was noted on the MED plug at the forward lower hinge guide fitting attachment location. All features were consistent with ductile overstress fracture. The vertical movement arrestor bolt holes in the aft lower hinge guide fitting were intact and undamaged. Overall, the observed damage patterns and absence of contact damage or deformation around holes associated with the vertical movement arrestor bolts and upper guide track bolts in the upper guide fittings, hinge fittings, and recovered aft lower hinge guide fitting indicate that the four bolts that prevent upward movement of the MED plug were missing before the MED plug moved upward off the stop pads. The Manufacturing Records Group traveled to Boeingâs Renton, Washington, facility to review manufacturing records for the accident airplane specific to the left MED plug area. According to records, the accident fuselage arrived at Boeingâs Renton facility by rail on August 31, 2023. During the manufacturing process, if any defects or discrepancies were found, a Non-Conformance Record (NCR) or a disposition required NCR were generated. On September 1, 2023, records show that NCR 1450292531 was created noting five damaged rivets on the edge frame forward of the left MED plug.  Documents and photos show that to perform the replacement of the damaged rivets, access to the rivets required opening the left MED plug. To open the MED plug, the two vertical movement arrestor bolts and two upper guide track bolts had to be removed. Records show the rivets were replaced per engineering requirements on Non-Conformance (NC) Order 145-8987-RSHK-1296-002NC completed on September 19, 2023, by Spirit AeroSystems personnel. Photo documentation obtained from Boeing shows evidence of theleft-hand MED plug closed with no retention hardware (bolts) in the three visible locations (the aft upper guide track is covered with insulation and cannot be seen in the photo). This image was attached to a text message between Boeing team members on September19, 2023, around 1839 local. These Boeing personnel were discussing interior restoration after the rivet rework was completed during second shift operations that day. The investigation continues to determine what manufacturing documents were used to authorize the opening and closing of the left MED plug during the rivet rework. The Human Performance Investigator joined the group to travel to Spirit AeroSystems, where they reviewed pertinent build work documents and observed a door plug installation. As mentioned earlier, the accident MED plug was manufactured by Spirit AeroSystems Malaysia on March 24, 2023, and received at Spirit AeroSystems Wichita on May 10, 2023. The MED plug was then installed and rigged on the fuselage prior to delivery to Boeing. During the build process, one quality notification (QN NW0002407062) was noted indicating the seal flushness was out of tolerance by 0.01 inches. No manufacturing rework was required, as Spirit AeroSystems Engineering determined the condition was structurally and functionally acceptable and did not adversely affect the form, fit, or function of the installation. There were no other QNs for the left MED plug before leaving Spirit AeroSystems. Fuselage Line 8789 was shipped to Boeing on August 20, 2023.  The group then traveled to AAR, Oklahoma City, where a wi-fi and PCS antenna was installed on the accident airplane from November 27, 2023, to December 7, 2023. The group reviewed applicable installation retrofit documents and received a presentation on AARâs quality assurance and safety management system (SMS) processes. The group also witnessed a wi-fi retrofit in progress. Facility representatives reported that they have modified approximately 60 Alaska Airlines 737-9 airplanes with the wi-fi and PCS antenna installation and have not had to remove or open any MED plugs for this work, to include the event airplane. The manufacturing/human performance group has done a complete records review from the time the event airplane left the Boeing factory to the time of the accident and found no evidence that the left MED plug was opened after leaving Boeingâs facility. Interviews of Boeing and Spirit AeroSystemsâ personnel will be scheduled at a future date. The group will also be looking at Boeingâs SMS and Spirit AeroSystemsâ ongoing development of its voluntary SMS program. The group will also assess the FAAâs involvement in the manufacturersâ development of their respective SMS programs and the level of oversight applied to each.  As a precaution, Alaska Airlines grounded its fleet of B737-9 airplanes to inspect the MED plugs soon after the event. Their inspections began Saturday morning, January 6, 2024. In addition, the FAA issued an emergency airworthiness directive on January 6 requiring all operators of 737-9 airplanes to conduct specific inspections before returning the airplanes to service. On January 21, 2024, the FAA published Safety Alert for Operators (SAFO) 24001 for operators that have the same MED plug as the accident airplane but on a different model of airplane. The SAFO is for Boeing 737-900ER airplanes and recommends that operators inspect, as soon as possible, the four locations where the retaining hardware secures the door to the airframe. Boeing issued multiple multi-operator messages (MOMs). The most recent, MOM 24-0010- 01B(R4) dated January 25, 2024, contains revised instructions for inspecting 737-9 airplanes that have the MED plugs. The NTSBâs investigation is ongoing.

The flight was a regularly scheduled domestic passenger flight from Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport (PHX), Phoenix, Arizona to IAH. The flight crew statements and flight data showed a stable approach to the landing flare. The first officer was pilot flying and stated he began the flare slightly late. Both crewmembers stated the touchdown was firm with a slight ânose-highâ bounce. The flight crew was not aware the airplaneâs tail had impacted the runway until the ground crew at the gate notified them. Flight data showed that the airplane touched down on the runway with a 6.5-degree nose-up attitude and vertical acceleration of 1.87g. The speed brakes deployed two seconds after the initial touchdown. At the same time, the aircraft became airborne again and the nose began to lower. Two seconds later, as the speed brakes retracted, the airplaneâs pitch began to increase, and the airplane touched down a second time with pitch of 7.2 degrees and a vertical acceleration of about 2.87g. The airplane became airborne for a 3rd time for about a second before it touched down for the final time. The nose was lowered to the ground, and speed brakes were extended again. Post-accident assessment of the aircraft revealed substantial damage to the auxiliary power unit (APU) firewall bulkhead that occurred as a result of the aircraftâs aft fuselageâs contact with the runway.  Probable Cause: The airplaneâs aft fuselage impacted the runway as a result of a delayed flare and subsequent nose-high pitch inputs during the aircraftâs multiple touchdowns.METAR: Weather about the incident time (1610Z): KIAH 101553Z 16009KT 10SM FEW150 SCT250 13/01 A2996 RMK AO2 SLP145 T01280011 KIAH 101653Z 18009KT 10SM FEW250 17/03 A2995 RMK AO2 SLP142 T01670028Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA24LA065 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA24LA065  https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=193637  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates20-Jan-2024 19:54 harro Added 08-Feb-2024 19:50 Captain Adam Updated [Time, Damage, Category, Accident report, ]04-May-2024 17:30 ASN Updated [Narrative, ]18-May-2024 19:24 Captain Adam Updated [Time, Total occupants, Location, Source, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

Once clear of clouds and with the runway in sight, the pilot canceled the instrument flight rules clearance, announced their position over the airportâs common traffic advisory frequency and received a reply with a report of 1/4 inch of dry snow covering the runway, unplowed. During the landing roll, they applied brakes, extended spoilers, and thrust reversers. Initially the airplane slowed; however, about halfway down the runway, the airplaneâs antiskid system was functioning continuously, and the airplaneâs rate of deceleration decreased. The pilot was unsure if the thrust reversers deployed, and he cycled the thrust reversers and did not feel any effects. The pilot stated that, in his experience, the airplaneâs thrust reversers do not feel very effective. The pilot considered aborting the landing, started to clean up the airplane but thought it was too late. The airplane overran the departure end of the runway, onto a grass covered area and into a deep ravine, resulting in substantial damage to the fuselage and both wings. The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation. The automated weather observation station located on the airport reported that, about 44 minutes before the accident, the wind was from 090Â° at 12 knots. The same automated station reported that, about 16 minutes after the accident, the wind was from 090Â° at 12 knots. The airplane landed on runway 22. The fixed based operator owner reported that, on the day of the accident, his review of the runway conditions at the airport appeared to be around an inch of snow on the runway surface. Additionally, plowing at the airport so far this year had been âabysmal.â Big windrows and ice chunks have been left; taxiway corners had been built up to the point there could be an occurrence should an airplane be taxiing by. Earlier this year, several departures were delayed due to the runway not being plowed. According to the chairman of the airport board, there is no formal process to conduct runway assessments. However, an airport board member lives in the area and routinely visits the airport to conduct runway assessments. The runway assessments and frequency of the observations are not documented but are conveyed verbally to the airport board via cell phone. To the best of his knowledge, there is no formal snow or ice removal plan. When the runway is required to be cleared, a board member will use county provided equipment to clear the runway. The frequency of the snow removal is not documented. The airport snow removal equipment is limited to clear substance to Â½ inch of the runway surface. On the day of the accident, he was not aware of a Notice to Air Misson (NOTAM) issued for the conditions of the runway environment. According to the airplane manufacturer, the estimated landing distance on a dry runway was about 3,350 ft, with loose snow and no tailwind the estimated landing distance was about 6,700 ft, and on loose snow with tailwind, the estimated landing distance was 7,531 ft. According to the Federal Aviation Administration, the airport is not required to have a snow and ice control plan. However, the airport was provided federal funds (grant) to purchase/acquire a snowplow to maintain the airport surfaces during inclement weather conditions. There may be times where issues arise, and action is delayed. In that case it is expected that a NOTAM be issued as outlined in the grant agreement. Probable Cause: The flight crewâs decision to land on a snow-covered runway with a tailwind, resulting in a runway excursion and subsequent impact with terrain. Contributing to the accident, was the failure of the airport authority to plow the runway.METAR: KLVM 111553Z AUTO 09012KT 10SM OVC019 M17/M19 A2968 RMK AO2 SLP131 T11671194 KLVM 111453Z AUTO 09012KT 10SM OVC019 M16/M19 A2967 RMK AO2 SLP127 60000 T11611189 53012Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: WPR24LA071 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: https://www.krtv.com/news/montana-and-regional-news/small-plane-ends-up-in-a-ravine-at-livingston-airport  https://www.kbzk.com/news/local-news/airplane-crashes-at-livingston-airport-after-missing-runway-passengers-injured  https://www.mclarens.com/auctions/1983-learjet-55-n558ra-s-n-086/  https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=193641  https://www.flightaware.com/live/flight/RAX698/history/20240111/1145Z/KPTK/KLVM  https://www.flightradar24.com/data/flights/rax698#33954ab0  Location  Images: Photos: NTSB Photos: NTSB Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates12-Jan-2024 03:43 Geno Added 12-Jan-2024 07:31 gianniprof Updated [Date, ]12-Jan-2024 07:37 harro Updated [Aircraft type, Registration, Cn, Operator, Other fatalities, Departure airport, Source, Damage, Narrative, ]12-Jan-2024 07:41 harro Updated [Other fatalities, Source, Narrative, ]12-Jan-2024 07:45 harro Updated [Other fatalities, Narrative, Category, ]12-Jan-2024 14:40 Anon.

The commercial pilot was seriously injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135 on-demand cargo flight. According to preliminary information from Federal Aviation Administration air traffic control (ATC), the airplane departed Manchester Boston Regional Airport (MHT), Manchester, New Hampshire, at 0710, destined for Presque Isle International Airport (PQI), Presque Isle, Maine. Immediately after takeoff, the airplane broadcast an emergency transponder code. The airplane then flew erratically for 16 minutes while the ATC controller attempted to establish radio contact, before it collided with wooded terrain about 5 miles south of MHT. A debris path was observed, beginning with a damaged fiber optic line about 75 ft high. The debris path extended on a magnetic course of 140Â° for about 200 ft through wooded terrain. The right aileron was found near the beginning of the debris path, suspended in a tree. The wreckage came to rest upright and oriented south at the end of the debris path. The airplaneâs left side (pilot side) cockpit door/hatch was subsequently located in a residential yard about 10 miles north of the main wreckage. Additionally, the airplane was equipped with a portable ladder for pilot entry, which secured to the fuselage under the cockpit door/hatch and was supposed to be stowed inside the cockpit before takeoff. The portable ladder was found outside and aft of the cockpit, resting against the left engine nacelle. The wreckage was retained for further examination.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA24FA097 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/plane-crash-londonderry-new-hampshire-nh-colonial-drive-beechcraft-99-faa/  NTSB  https://registry.faa.gn53rpov/AircraftInquiry/Search/NNumberResult?nNumberTxt=53RP  https://www.flightaware.com/live/flight/N53RP/history/20240126/1120Z/KMHT/KPQI  https://www.instagram.com/p/C2mp5HyO_GQ/  https://cdn.jetphotos.com/full/6/73675_1520438478.jpg (photo) History of this aircraft Ex N64977 Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  2 February 2012 N53RP UAS Transervices Inc, opf.

The airline transport pilot, commercial co-pilot, and two passengers were not injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14Code of Federal Regulations Part 135 on-demand passenger flight. The left seat pilot, who was the pilot flying (PF), reported that when the flight was about 1 hour 15 minutes from MCO, the pilot monitoring (PM) checked the automated terminal information service which advised that the wind was from 270Â° at 14 knots, gusting to 24 knots. After reviewing the runway configuration at MCO they determined the gust value was beyond limits of the airplane, but they then reviewed the operatorâs crosswind performance limits (CPL) and determined it was acceptable to continue to the planned destination. The PF planned to obtain a wind check on final approach at MCO, and if the wind was out of limits the flight would proceed to Executive Airport (ORL), Orlando, Florida, which had a more favorable runway configuration. The PF and PM briefed the arrival and while approaching MCO they checked the automated weather observing system (AWOS) several times. They noted only one instance of wind gusts reported, and that the AWOS was mostly reporting wind from 270Â° to 280Â° at 13 or 14 knots. The flight continued and was cleared for a visual approach. The PM requested a wind check and the local controller replied 290Â° at 21 knots. The PF recalled their previous review of the CPL and noted the wind was at the 19 to 20 knots crosswind component, but then referenced the wind vector on the primary flight display (PFD) and noted an 18-knot crosswind component. The PF elected to continue the approach to runway 36L as the wind was âwithin limits.â He referenced the wind vector on the PFD a final time as the flight crossed the threshold and noted the crosswind was 17 knots. The flight landed on the runway centerline in the touchdown zone and the PF applied left aileron control input to counter the crosswind and deployed the speedbrake. The airplane began drifting left, which the PF attempted to correct with right rudder input but with no effect. The airplane departed the left side of the runway surface, rolled onto grass, and impacted a runway distance remaining sign. The PF was then able to correct to the right, travel back onto the runway, then taxi off the runway at taxiway E and stop where the airplane was secured and then evacuated. According to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) audio communications from the MCO air traffic control tower local west position, at the initial contact with the local controller about 1620, the flight crew were advised the wind was from 290Â° at 21 knots. At 1622:06, a voice from an unidentified aircraft asked for a wind check on the same frequency, and the controller responded 290Â° at 19 knots ânow gusting two fourâ knots. At 1622:06, the accident airplane was about 1.24 nautical miles from the runway 36L threshold. After the accident the flight crew was asked by the controller if they experienced a flat tire, a flight crew member responded, ânegative, weâre not sure, it could have been a gust, but ah weâre not sure.â The operator reported there was no airplane or airplane systemâs warnings or malfunctions before touchdown. Examination of the airplane by an FAA inspector and a representative of the airplane manufacturer revealed no evidence of any failures or malfunctions of the primary or secondary flight controls. The rudder and aileron trims had been set at the neutral position. According to the airplane manufacturer, the left wing forward spar exhibited cracks and deformation. The airplane was equipped with a cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder which were retained for read-out. The airplane flight manual specified the crosswind limitation as 20 knots.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA24LA100 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: NTSB  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates12-Apr-2024 20:37 Captain Adam Added 11-Oct-2024 11:59 ASN Updated Corrections or additions? ...

The captain and co-pilot were fatally injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 positioning flight. The airplane, which was operated by Vici Aviation, LLC and managed by Clay Lacy Aviation, Inc., arrived at West Star Aviationâs facility at Grand Junction Regional Airport (GJT), Grand Junction, Colorado on December 20, 2023 for routine maintenance. According to preliminary information from the maintenance facility, multiple routine inspections had been completed on the airplane including a requirement to remove the wing leading edges and TKS panels to inspect for cracks and signs of corrosion. After the inspections were completed, the airplane was returned to service on February 6, 2024. The flight crew had planned to fly the airplane from GJT to Gig Harbor, Washington on the day of the accident, during which time they would perform a stall warning and systems check in accordance with the airframe manufacturerâs requirements. These requirements, which were listed in the pilotâs operating manual, included a required altitude above 10,000 ft above ground level, 10,000 ft above clouds and below 18,000 ft mean sea level. In addition, this check flight could only be conducted during day visual meteorological conditions with a good visual horizon, with the autopilot disengaged, an operative stall identification system, the external surfaces free of ice, the ventral tank empty and weather radar on standby. According to preliminary automatic dependent system broadcast (ADS-B) data, the airplane departed GJT at 1037 and entered a climb on a southeast heading. The flight crew asked air traffic control (ATC) for a block of altitude from FL180 to FL200 and ATC approved the request. The airplane circled to the northwest as it continued to climb and subsequently leveled off at 1043:49, near the top of the altitude block. At 1046:47 the flight track data showed the airplane begin a rapid descent in circular pattern that resembled the shape of a corkscrew. The airplane made multiple rotations before the track ceased at 1047:44. The airplane came to rest in flat open terrain about 25 nm northwest of GJT at an elevation of about 4,800 ft mean sea level and oriented on a west heading. The airplaneâs major structures were all accounted for at the accident site. A debris path was traced from the main wreckage to the end of a burn area that was about 200 ft long and 175 ft wide at the widest point, oriented on a magnetic heading of 345Â°. A silhouette of the left wing, fuselage and both engines was located about 10 ft south of the main wreckage. The airplaneâs flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder were both recovered from the accident site. The wreckage has also been retained for further examination.METAR: Weather at the departure airport about the departure (1737Z) and accident time (1747Z): KGJT 071753Z 35008KT 10SM -RA BKN037 OVC055 07/02 A2959 RMK AO2 RAE08B26 SLP994 P0000 60001 T00670017 10083 20044 51013 KGJT 071653Z 17009KT 10SM -RA BKN047 OVC085 07/00 A2957 RMK AO2 RAB37 SLP988 P0001 T00720000Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: WPR24FA083 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: https://www.kkco11news.com/2024/02/07/possible-plane-crash-reported-near-loma/  NTSB  https://globe.adsbexchange.com/?icao=ac7108&lat=39.123&lon=-108.648&zoom=8.4&showTrace=2024-02-07&trackLabels  Location  Media: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates07-Feb-2024 19:53 Captain Adam Added 07-Feb-2024 20:50 nhofmann54 Updated [Registration, Cn, Operator, Phase, Departure airport, Source, Damage, ]07-Feb-2024 20:56 ASN Updated [Time, Phase, Departure airport, Narrative, ]07-Feb-2024 21:00 ASN Updated [Source, ]07-Feb-2024 21:40 Anon.

While taxiing within the Amelia Earhart de-icing pad area, the left winglet of JetBlue Airways flight 777 collided with the right horizontal stabilizer and elevator of JetBlue Airways flight 551. There were no injuries to the 210 passengers and crew on flight 551 or the 154 passengers and crew on flight 777. The flight crew of flight 551 stated that, following a normal preflight and uneventful taxi from the gate to the de-icing pad, they were guided by a 'follow me' vehicle. The flight crew proceeded to follow the vehicle to the D2 parking spot. A yellow painted 'T' inside a black square marked the proper stopping point location for the airplane's nose tires when parked. Nearing the stopping point, the 'follow me' vehicle turned to the right and stopped with its headlights facing toward the back of the airplane. The driver of the 'follow me' vehicle communicated with the flight crew via radio and began a 'countdown' for when the captain should stop the airplane.  Upon the verbal stop command, the captain stopped the airplane and set the parking brake. After the de-ice procedure was complete, the flight crew received instructions to taxi the airplane to runway 9 for departure. Immediately after releasing the airplane's parking brake, the flight crew felt jolts and vibrations and the airplane swayed back and forth. The captain set the parking brake and the first officer (FO) contacted air traffic control (ATC) and was informed they had been struck by another aircraft. In a post-accident statement, the driver of the 'follow me' vehicle indicated that he stopped the airplane (flight 551) at what he thought was the normal stopping point.  He had difficulty seeing the yellow 'T' -bar due to the dark night conditions and the de-icing fluid that was present on the ground. A post-accident inspection found that the airplane was about 35 ft short of the normal stopping point.  The flight crew of flight 777 indicated that after a normal preflight and uneventful taxi from the gate to the de-icing pad they were guided to the D1 spot by a 'follow me' vehicle. The captain stated spacing appeared to be tight and he focused on the yellow taxi line to ensure proper clearance from other airplanes in the area. Shortly thereafter, while taxiing, the flight crew heard a grinding noise and felt a vibration. While still moving forward, they heard another aircraft on the radio frequency ask if something had struck their airplane. The flight crew of flight 777 stopped their airplane and set the parking brake. The captain had difficulty seeing the left winglet due to the dark night conditions but noted that it was intact. In addition, he was unable to see the empennage of flight 551 parked at the D2 location as it was behind them. Flight 551 (N956JT) sustained substantial damage to the left horizontal stabilizer and the left elevator. As a result of this event, Aeromag investigated and produced a February 12, 2024, memo to their BOS-JBU [JetBlue] operations staff discussing an amendment to the Coordinator of Traffic and Movement (CTM) phraseology and aircraft stopping procedures. The memo outlined the updated procedures and phraseology as: â¢	âFollow meâ truck is now required to verbally confirm with the flight crew that the aircraft is correctly stopped on the deicing âTâ-Bar. â¢	JetBlue will add to the Airport Briefing Guide (ABG) that the pilot will not configure the aircraft until confirmation that the aircraft is correctly stopped on the deicing âTâ-Bar. â¢	The âfollow meâ truck is required to check the rear of the aircraft to ensure that it is within the bay and clear of the zipper line before confirming brake set.  â¢	Safety Lead will perform a secondary check, reconfirming with the CTM that the aircraft has stopped on the deicing âTâ-Bar. Safety Lead will also verify that the rear of the aircraft is clear of the zipper line and within the bay.  â¢	Truck positioning and aircraft deicing will commence after these checks have been completed. Additionally, once CTM has confirmed with the flight crew that they have a visual on the âfollow meâ truck, the âfollow meâ truck operator will follow these steps: 1. Guide the aircraft into the assigned bay.  2. Ensure the aircraft is properly stopped on the deicing âTâ-Bar.  3. Confirm that the rear of the aircraft is within the bay, clear of the zipper line, before bringing any other aircraft in. Finally, the Safety Lead will:  1. Inspect and confirm with CTM that the aircraft is properly stopped on the deicing âTâ-Bar.  2. Inspect that the rear of the aircraft is well within the bay and clear of the zipper line. Aeromag also increased its daily roster to include sufficient qualified staff to allocate a Safety Lead dedicated to each operational bay regardless of operating conditions. Long term prevention strategies identified were: â¢	Repainting and reviewing the color format of the delineated markings using high-visibility paint and/or reflective inset markers. â¢	Investigating the feasibility of adding high mast lighting for the Earhart facility. â¢	Operational audits to focus on the correct positioning of aircraft while maintaining the safety buffer zones. â¢	Explore opportunities to locate Aeromag tower personnel in elevated positions. Probable Cause: The 'follow me' driver stopping the airplane (flight 551) about 35 feet from the normal stopping point due to a difficulty in seeing the yellow 'T'-bar because of the dark night conditions and the presence of de-icing fluid on the ground.METAR: Weather about the time of the incident: KBOS 081054Z 13003KT 10SM FEW070 FEW250 M02/M03 A3032 RMK AO2 SLP265 T10171028 KBOS 081154Z 00000KT 10SM FEW040 SCT070 M02/M03 A3032 RMK AO2 SLP267 T10171028 10006 21022 53002 KBOS 081254Z 00000KT 10SM BKN055 01/M02 A3034 RMK AO2 SLP274 T00111017Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA24LA092B Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: https://www.boston25news.com/news/local/two-jet-blue-planes-collide-ground-bostons-logan-airport/DNURNM3MMVCKFC25DX2VLOMM2Q/  https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=193765  https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/n2157j#33eb1f23  Location  Media:#BREAKINGNEWS: Two Jet Blue planes collided on the ground at Logan Airport on Thursday morning, FAA says?Dave Sauter, Real Ryan B, and Scott Pickard https://t.co/BNaicCKSgY pic.twitter.com/sskdKm9znXâ Boston 25 News (@boston25) February 8, 2024 Aircraft incident #Boston Logan airport.

The two pilots were fatally injured. The cabin attendant and the two passengers sustained minor injuries, and one person on the ground suffered minor injury.  The airplane was returning to Naples Municipal Airport (APF), Naples, Florida, from Ohio State University Airport (OSU), Columbus, Ohio, where it had flown earlier in the day. The airplane was serviced with 350 gallons of fuel before departure from OSU. The flight crew contacted the ATC tower at APF while on a right downwind leg of the approach to the airport and maneuvering for a 5-mile final approach to runway 23. At 15:08, the tower controller cleared the flight to land. The airplane was about 6.5 miles north of APF as it turned for the base leg of the traffic pattern. A preliminary review by the NTSB of the FDR data revealed that the first of three Master Warnings was recorded at 1509:33 (L ENGINE OIL PRESSURE), the second immediately following at 1509:34 (R ENGINE OIL PRESSURE), and at 1509:40 (ENGINE). The system alerted pilots with illumination of a âMaster Warningâ light on the glareshield, a corresponding red message on the crew alerting system page and a triple chime voice advisory (âEngine oilâ). Twenty seconds later, at 1510:05, about 1,000 ft msl and 122 kts, on a shallow intercept angle for the final approach course, the crew announced, ââ¦lost both enginesâ¦ emergencyâ¦ making an emergency landingâ. The tower controller acknowledged the call and cleared the airplane to land. At 1510:12, about 900 ft and 115 knots, the crew replied, âWe are cleared to land but we are not going to make the runwayâ¦ ahâ¦ we have lost both engines.â There were no further transmissions from the flight crew. The aircraft descended towards Interstate 75 and touched down aligned with traffic travelling the southbound lanes. The left main landing gear touched down first in the center of the three lanes, and then the right main landing gear touched down in the right lane. The airplane continued through the break-down lane and into the grass shoulder area before impacting a concrete sound barrier. After the airplane came to rest, the cabin attendant stated that she identified that the cabin and emergency exits were blocked by fire and coordinated the successful egress of her passengers and herself through the baggage compartment door in the tail section of the airplane. An inspection of the engine, fuel system and oil filters revealed no immediate anomalies. The MFCs and main fuel pumps from both engines, the fuel injectors from both engines, and all collected fuel samples were retained by the NTSB for further examination. Both engines were also retained for additional examination.METAR: Weather about the accident time (2010Z) KAPF 092053Z 18009KT 10SM BKN050 26/14 A3012 RMK AO2 SLP199 T02560139 56018 KAPF 091953Z 22010KT 10SM SCT050 24/14 A3013 RMK AO2 SLP202 T02440144Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA24FA110 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: https://winknews.com/2024/02/09/plane-crash-i-75-collier-county/  https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/09/us/plane-crash-florida-highway-naples.html  https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/02/09/plane-crash-i-75-naples-florida/72542835007/  NTSB  https://registry.faa.gov/AircraftInquiry/Search/NNumberResult?nNumberTxt=823KD  https://www.flightaware.com/live/flight/HPJ823/history/20240209/1730Z/KOSU/KAPF  https://archive.liveatc.net/kapf/KAPF1-Tower-Feb-09-2024-2000Z.mp3   https://cdn.jetphotos.com/full/5/707837_1706244336.jpg (photo)  https://www.hopajetworldwide.com/aircraft/n823kd/ History of this aircraft Ex (N316KD), N823KD, N828KD, C-FAWU, C-GLXM Location  Media: BREAKING: We're learning more about a plane crash in Naples on I-75. pic.twitter.com/3slB22MMgLâ ABC7 Sarasota (@mysuncoast) February 9, 2024 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates09-Feb-2024 20:32 ASN Added 09-Feb-2024 20:33 ASN Updated [Embed code, Damage, Category, ]09-Feb-2024 20:37 ASN Updated [Aircraft type, Source, Embed code, Narrative, ]09-Feb-2024 20:40 ASN Updated [Aircraft type, Registration, Cn, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, ]09-Feb-2024 20:42 ASN Updated [Time, Operator, Phase, Narrative, ]09-Feb-2024 20:47 ASN Updated [Narrative, ]09-Feb-2024 20:52 ASN Updated [Source, Embed code, ]09-Feb-2024 21:02 ASN Updated [Location, Embed code, Narrative, Category, ]09-Feb-2024 21:04 ASN Updated 09-Feb-2024 22:14 nhofmann54 Updated [Total fatalities, Total occupants, Other fatalities, Source, ]10-Feb-2024 07:35 Vice Captain Edmond Updated [Nature, Narrative, ]10-Feb-2024 07:37 ASN Updated [Narrative, ]10-Feb-2024 09:05 RobertMB Updated [Time, Aircraft type, Operator, Location, Nature, Source, Narrative, ]10-Feb-2024 10:14 Captain Adam Updated [Source, Narrative, ]10-Feb-2024 15:42 Iceman 29 Updated [Embed code, ]11-Feb-2024 10:11 Anon.

The flight crew performed a go-around and proceeded for a landing on runway 26R, 18 minutes later.  The aircraft operated on a flight from Tel Aviv (TLV) with the captain being Pilot Monitoring (PM) and the first officer being Pilot Flying (PF). At 17:22, the pilots performed the approach briefing. At 17:47, the airplane captured the localizer and the pilots received the clearance for an ILS approach 26L. Two minutes later the PM reported âlocalizer establishedâ. The approach was flown manually and the engine thrust levers were controlled manually. During the approach, the landing checklist was completed and at 17:53:20, at 1,000 ft, the co-pilot, as Pilot Flying (PF), determined the approach as stabilised. The PM confirmed it and the approach was continued. As the runway was reached, the PF initiated the flare of the airplane and attempted to align it with the runway from a crosswind approach. At 17:54:31, the airplane touched down for the first time. It lifted off again, rolled right and at 17:54:34, touched down again. At 17:54:37, both pilots almost simultaneously said âgo-aroundâ and the captain intervened in the steering.  During the second bounce the nose was pitched up and at the same time the ground spoilers extended. The combination of both caused the nose to pitch up to +13.7 degrees and the tail strike occurred. The captain then performed the go-around and acted as PF until the landing at 18:12.

Of the 280 passengers and crew, two flight attendants received serious injuries and one received a minor injury. The flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 as a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), Los Angeles, California to EWR. The first officer (FO) was the pilot flying and the captain was the pilot monitoring. The flight crew stated that the departure from LAX was uneventful and the flight leveled off at a cruise altitude of FL350. The FO stated that he was responsible for briefing the approach/arrival into EWR and in preparation for the brief, checked for potential turbulence using the Weather Services International (WSI) application (APP) and used the Skypath APP to see if there were any reports of turbulence. Neither application revealed any significant indications of turbulence along their route. After the brief, the captain turned the onboard weather radar ON for the eventual descent into EWR. The FO stated that while descending through about FL270, the captain announced via the passenger address (PA) system for the flight attendants (FA) to prepare the cabin for landing. Following the announcement, the captain turned the seatbelt sign ON. The FO stated that he observed an overcast layer of clouds ahead and below that the flight would penetrate on their descent to EWR. However, there was no indication of potential turbulence as nothing showed on the aircraft's weather radar or the Skypath APP. Additionally, there were no reports of turbulence from ATC or dispatch. The pilots reported that while descending through about FL210 in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), the flight encountered moderate turbulence lasting a few seconds that caused unsecured items on the flightdeck to be thrown about. After the event, the captain immediately called the cabin crew and was informed of multiple injuries with one flight attendant sustaining a head laceration. Upon being notified of the injuries, the flight crew declared a medical emergency and requested paramedics meet the aircraft at the gate in EWR. Post-flight, two FAâs were diagnosed with fracture injuries and a third was diagnosed with a sub-cranial bleed. Postaccident examination of the weather in the area revealed a frontal boundary moving eastward across New York state. In addition, an upper-level jet stream maximum was located above the accident site. Satellite and weather radar imagery, along with lightning and surface data depicted strong cells in the vicinity of the flight. The U.S National Weather Service (NWS) had issued current Significant Meteorological (SIGMET) warning for embedded thunderstorms with tops reaching FL280 over the region. NTSB group chairs in the areas of air traffic control, operations, meteorology, survival factors, and flight data recorder were assigned.Qualified parties were invited to participate in the investigation. These included the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), United Airlines, The Boeing Company, Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), and the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA). Certified ADS-B data and audio recordings were provided to the NTSB by the FAA. The NTSB is currently analyzing this data. At the time of the accident, flight 1890 was being controlled by air traffic control located at the Boston Air Route Traffic Control Center (ZBW ARTCC). During the week of March 4th, 2024, the ATC group and meteorology specialist traveled to Nashua, New Hampshire to interview personnel at the control center. Data from the digital flight data recorder (DFDR) and the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) were sent to the NTSBâs Vehicle Recorder Laboratory in Washington, DC, for analysis. The investigation continues.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA24LA097 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: FAA  https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/n788ua#33f25f48 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  30 September 2024 N788UA United Airlines 0 148 nm NW of Calgary, AB non Fumes/smoke/odor event Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates12-Feb-2024 20:43 ASN Added 13-Feb-2024 07:31 ASN Updated [Time, Location, Narrative, ]16-Feb-2024 12:29 harro Updated [Other fatalities, ]12-Mar-2024 20:14 Captain Adam Updated [Time, Location, Narrative, Category, Accident report, ]01-Apr-2024 09:10 ASN Updated Corrections or additions? ...

There were no injuries. During the flight preparation, the crew planned to take off from runway 30L, intersection D6. The Take-Off Run Available (TORA) distance at D6 is 2349 meters. The  flight parameter calculations for this intersection were double-checked by the crew. The crew then received instructions from ATC to taxi to position D6 for runway 30L via taxiways F, G, and A, which the crew correctly read back.  At 16:35 UTC, the crew informed the ATC unit that they were approaching intersection D6: ""Air Serbia 86C, approaching  D6, ready."" The controller responded by instructing the flight to hold short, followed by a clearance to line up and wait via D6. At 16:36 UTC, ATC urgently contacted the crew, inquiring if they were aware they were at intersection D5 instead of D6. The crew quickly responded, thanking for the information. ATC immediately contacted the crew again, informing them that the available takeoff length from the given intersection was 1,273 meters, suggesting it was insufficient for a safe takeoff.  The crew requested a minute to perform checks. According to the crew's statement, they then performed flight parameter calculations using the copilot's tablet. During this time, ATC instructed the crew to perform necessary calculations and to contact them, with the option to backtrack to D6 if needed.  Thirty seconds later, the crew contacted the ATC, confirming they were ready for takeoff. ATC acknowledged, asking if they could take off from position/intersection D5, which the crew immediately confirmed. ATC then cleared the flight to take off from runway 30L from position D5, informing them of no wind.  At 16:38 UTC, the aircraft began its takeoff roll.  During the takeoff roll the flight crew made engine thrust changes to achieve a higher speed. At 80 knots, the crew stated everything was normal, but at 100 knots, they noticed insufficient runway length. Considering the available runway length and the aircraft's speed, the crew decided it was safer to continue the takeoff, estimating the aircraft would soon become airborne. They set the engine thrust to maximum and decided to delay rotating the nose of the aircraft to utilize the maximum available runway length and asphalt area beyond the runway. Shortly after leaving the runway and asphalt area, according to the flight crew's statement, the aircraft began to shake, followed by a sound of impact against an object. The plane quickly became airborne, during which the crew continuously heard an unfamiliar noise from the aircraft's body, with interruptions in the operation of the left wing lights. Upon receiving information about issues with several systems, including flaps and engine bleed air, the crew followed the indicated checklist procedures for troubleshooting. Shortly after takeoff, ATC contacted the crew, inquiring about the deviation from the approved flight vector during takeoff. The crew replied that they were unsure but would likely need to return to the airport. Soon after, the crew informed ATC that they needed to return because they had hit something on the ground during takeoff. A little later, they declared a mayday. ATC suggested the crew check the landing gear, with the possibility of a low pass by the control tower. The crew requested time for additional checks, performing two circuits southeast of the airport. According to the crew's statements, they checked the aircraft using checklists to locate the problem. Meanwhile, ATC prepared for the emergency landing. The aircraft then performed a low pass over the runway heading 300 with the landing gear extended, with no issues identified by ATC regarding the landing gear. During descent and flight, the crew reported problems with the flaps and increased aircraft vibrations. After the flyby, the crew decided to land, proceeding with a left turn into the airport circuit, followed by landing on the left runway, runway 30L, at 17:36 UTC. According to the crew's statement, they opted for a slightly higher landing speed due to problems with the flaps, but within prescribed limits, experiencing only vibrations as an issue. After landing, the crew had no further problems with the aircraft and, following communication with ATC, agreed to park at parking position C2. Upon stopping, the crew received information from ground personnel that fuel was leaking from the left wing, quickly shutting down the engines and other systems. During the inspection, significant damage to the aircraft's fuselage was discovered, including multiple punctures on the left side, damage to the root of the left wing with aerodynamic fairing damage at the fuselage-wing junction, punctures in the aircraft's fairing, and damage to the aircraft systems below the fairing, damage to the leading edge of the wing adjacent to the fuselage. During the inspection of airport surfaces in the direction of the aircraft's takeoff from RWY30L, damage to the approach lights for RWY12R was found - the extreme right lights in all three rows (or extreme left in the direction of the aircraft's takeoff) with damage to the control boxes located in the middle of the lights. During rotation, the left wing root hit the support for the Instrument Landing System (ILS) monitor antenna. The antenna broke off, the larger part of which remained embedded in the aircraft. PROBABLE CAUSE (preliminary, the investigation is ongoing): One of the likely causes of this accident is the inadequate assessment of parameters for takeoff during pre-flight preparation by the flight crew of the aircraft, following the decision to take off from a shorter length of the runway in relation to the initially planned one.METAR: METARs about the incident time (1638Z): LYBE 181700Z 02002KT CAVOK 10/04 Q1030 NOSIG= LYBE 181630Z 33002KT CAVOK 10/04 Q1030 NOSIG=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CINS Report number: 01-24 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/oy-gdc#340bbf81  https://globe.adsbexchange.com/?icao=459c83&lat=44.824&lon=20.291&zoom=16.3&showTrace=2024-02-18&trackLabels  https://www.exyuaviation.com/2024/02/marathon-e195-operating-for-air-serbia.html History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  16 October 2017 G-FBEM Flybe 0 near Dublin Airport (EIDW) non Fumes/smoke/odor event Location  Images: Media:??Runway excursion Accident Embraer ERJ-195LR OY-GDC.

The flight was a local maintenance test flight. The purpose of the test flight was to validate maintenance conducted after a write-up for abnormal flight deck noises that occurred on a previous flight.  According to the flight crew, they conducted a flaps 5, reduced power takeoff from runway 28R. The captain recalled the aircraft accelerated faster than normal and had the propensity to lift off prior to the rotation speed of 127 knots. At rotation speed, the captain began a normal aft pull on the control yoke and the pitch attitude increased faster than expected. The captain just called âpositive rate' when the crew heard and felt a âboom.' As this flight was a test flight, it was not loaded with passengers and cargo to a takeoff weight typical of flights the pilot flying normally flew. The pilot flying rotated at a rate ânormal' to his experience, however because the accident aircraft was loaded lighter than normal, the normal rotation inputs resulted in an over-rotation.    The crew assessed the instruments and controllability and decided to continue their climb to flight level (FL) 190 [19,000 feet] where they conducted the tailstrike checklist. They returned to SFO and conducted a flaps 30 landing with no further incident. Prior to leaving the flight deck after the flight, the first officer received the pitch report for takeoff which showed that tail contact occurred about 12.2 degrees during departure and the actual pitch for this departure reached 15.3 degrees.  Inspection of the aircraft showed that the tail strike damaged the chord, web, and stiffeners of the auxiliary power unit firewall bulkhead. Because the damage would adversely affect the structural strength of the bulkhead and require major repair or replacement, the damage was considered substantial. The investigation determined that the maintenance conducted prior to this test flight was not related to the accident. The aircraft was repaired and resumed regular service on 23 March 2024. Probable Cause: The crew's over-rotation of the aircraft pitch during takeoff which resulted in a tailstrike.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA24LA110 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA24LA110  https://www.flightaware.com/live/flight/N13138/history/20240226/0210Z/KSFO/KSFO History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  16 November 2021 N13138 United Airlines 0 Boston-Logan International Airport, MA (BOS/KBOS) min APU failure 9 February 2023 N13138 United Airlines 0 N of Tampa, FL non Turbulence Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates18-May-2024 18:22 Captain Adam Added 18-May-2024 19:08 ASN Updated [Location, Phase, Source, Narrative, ]20-Jul-2024 07:27 ASN Update Bot Updated [Time, Cn, Operator, Other fatalities, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, ]20-Jul-2024 08:04 ASN Updated [Source, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The Cessna crashed in Nairobi National Park, killing both occupants, and was destroyed. The Dash 8 safely returned to Wilson Airport. All 39 passengers and five crew on board were not injured. The aircraft sustained damage to the leading edge of the right-hand horizontal stabilizer. The Cessna operated on a training flight and was performing touch-and-goes on runway 07. The Safarilink Dash 8 was cleared for takeoff by the tower controller and the crew was told to look out for traffic upwind runway 07 (5Y-NNJ). The upwind traffic was also advised to look out for the DHC-8 departing runway 14.  According to the crew, while climbing through 400 ft, the captain had visual traffic to his 8 oâclock position which he described as being well clear of conflict. At approximately 6,000ft, the crew heard a loud bang and felt an impact. The PIC felt an imbalance (a yaw) and immediately tried to recover stability of the aircraft. The PIC stopped climbing and leveled off at 6,200ft.  The flight then returned to WIL after reported a possible collision with another aircraft.

The left main landing gear (MLG) departed the paved surface and contacted a concrete structure that was recessed into the ground, resulting in its separation.  The 6 crew and 160 passengers were deplaned via airstairs.  No injuries were reported.  The flight was a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 scheduled domestic passenger flight from Memphis International Airport (MEM), Memphis, Tennessee to IAH.  In response to the accident, the NTSB traveled to Houston. As part of the investigative process, the NTSB invited qualified parties to participate in the investigation. These included the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), United Airlines, The Boeing Company, and the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA). The parties were formed into specialized investigative groups led by NTSB group chairs in the areas of Operations, Human Performance, Systems, Structures, Digital Flight Data Recorder (DVDR) and Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR). History of Flight According to the flight crew, the captain was the pilot flying and the first officer (FO) was the pilot monitoring. The captain said he observed the reported runway surface condition codes when checking the automatic terminal information system (ATIS) via his electronic flight bag (EFB). For runway 26L and 26R, he recalled seeing codes of 3/3/3 and for runway 27 codes of 5/5/5. The actual runway surface condition codes being broadcasted on the ATIS for runway 27 at the time were 3/3/3 which according to the runway condition assessment matrix (RCAM) indicated the runway was slippery when wet and âbraking deceleration is noticeably reduced for the wheel braking effort applied or directional control is noticeably reduced.â When the crew checked in with Houston Approach Control, they were told to expect a landing on runway 26L. The captain asked the FO to request a landing on runway 27 instead. The FO made, and the controller approved the request and issued instructions for the instrument landing system (ILS) approach to runway 27. After checking in with Houston Tower (about 12,000 feet msl according to the FO), the captain asked the FO to request approval to roll to the end of runway 27. The FO made the request. A tower controller approved it and instructed them, âkeep your speed upâ. The captain changed the autobrake setting from 2 to 1 (which would command a reduced deceleration rate). The approach was conducted in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) and, according to the crew, the airplane broke out of the clouds between 800 and 1,000 feet msl. They reported that visibility under the clouds was good, and the captain recalled that the runway appeared dry. The FO recalled that the runway appeared wet. The crew stated that the touchdown was uneventful, at an appropriate speed, and within the touchdown zone. The speed brakes extended normally, and the thrust reversers were deployed to idle reverse thrust. The captain said that, shortly after touchdown, he retracted the speedbrakes by the action of moving the speedbrake lever to its down and locked position, which disabled the autobrakes. He did not âslow too much initiallyâ because the runway appeared dry, he wanted to expedite their time on the runway, and because he preferred decelerating gradually for passenger comfort.  The captain said he applied the brakes manually using the toe brakes at about 6,000 feet from the end of the runway but felt as if the deceleration was less than normal. DFDR data and automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) data indicated that after the disabling of the autobrakes occurred, manual braking did not begin until the airplane was about 4,000 feet from the end of the runway. The captain recalled hearing the runway awareness and advisory system (RAAS) alert indicating 1,000 ft of runway distance remaining. He became concerned and began applying more pressure to the brakes. As he approached the end of the runway, he elected to attempt to turn onto taxiway SC, by utilizing the steering tiller and rudder pedals while pushing aggressively on the brake pedals. During the turn onto the taxiway, he felt the fuselage and rudder/brake pedals begin to shake violently. He briefly released the brake pressure and the shaking ceased. He then reapplied aggressive brake pressure and the shaking resumed. The airplane slid off the runway and the left MLG tires and nose wheels tires entered the grass before the airplane came to a rest with its left wing low. A postaccident examination of the accident site revealed that the left MLG tires had impacted a large concrete âmanholeâ designed as an electrical junction box for lights/utilities at the airport. As a result of the impact, the left MLG separated from the airplane at the fuse pins near the rear spar as designed to prevent more severe damage to surrounding structures. The airplane came to rest on the left engine nacelle, left winglet, and aft fuselage and sustained substantial damage to the left wing and aft fuselage. Flight Crew The captain was 61 years old and held an airline transport pilot (ATP) certificate with a rating for multiengine-land, commercial privileges for airplane single engine land, and type ratings on the B-727, B-737, B-757, B-767 which included the limitation English Proficient. He held an FAA first-class medical certificate dated October 4, 2023, with the limitation of must use corrective lenses to meet vision standards at all required distances. The captain was hired by United Airlines on April 29, 1987, and had accumulated about 15,191 hours in B-737 aircraft with about 9,607 of those hours as pilot-in-command. The FO was 38 years old and held an ATP certificate with a rating for multi-engine land, commercial privileges for airplane single engine land, and type ratings in the B-737, and L-188 which included the limitation of B-737 Circling approach VMC Only, and English Proficient. He held an FAA first-class medical certificate dated June 8, 2023. The FO was hired by United Airlines on October 1, 2019, and had accumulated about 1,252 hours in B-737 aircraft. Weather Conditions and Flight Crew Procedures A Meteorological Aerodrome Report (METAR) at IAH was reporting at 0753 CST, wind from 190Â° at 5 knots, tower visibility 1 Â½ mile in mist, ceiling broken at 800 ft agl, overcast at 1,800 ft, temperature 23Â°C (73Â°F), dew point temperature 22Â°C (71Â°F), altimeter 29.71 inches of mercury. Remarks: automated observation system with a precipitation discriminator, surface visibility 2 Â½ miles, sea level pressure 1005.9-hPa, temperature 22.8Â°C, dew point 21.7Â°C. Photos and surveillance video during and immediately following the accident indicated wet runway and taxiway surface conditions. United Airlines supplementary flight crew procedures required for âLanding on Wet or Slippery Runwayâ stated in part: ??? ??????? ??????? ?????? ?? ???? ?? ???????? ????? ???? ????? ?????????. ?????? ????????? ??? ???? ????????? ?? ???? ?????. ?? ??? ???? ??? ??? ???? ????? ?? ?????????. ????????? ???????? ????????? ??? ???????? ???????? ?? ??? ??????? ?????? ???? ????? ??? ?????? ?? ????????? ??????? ?? 3 ?? ???, ?? ???????????. ?? ??? ????? ??????, ????????? ?????? ?????????? ?? ??????? ?????? ?????????, ?? ???????????? ??? ??? ??? ??????????. Data Data from the DFDR was sent to the NTSBâs Vehicle Recorder Laboratory in Washington, DC, for analysis. Data showed that at touchdown the speed brake lever position [Speed Brake Lever Pos] and auto brake parameters were full up and on for about 5 seconds before transitioning to down and locked and off for the remainder of the landing rollout. The engine thrust reversers were deployed for the left and right engines for about 27 and 26 seconds respectively at idle reverse. The left and right brake pressure increased to their maximum pressure consistent with aggressive manual braking before and as the airplaneâs heading changed consistent with a right turn. The CVR was removed from the airplane and sent to the NTSBâs Vehicle Recorder Laboratory in Washington, DC, for analysis. Certified ADS-B data, which records more accurate latitude and longitude data than the DFDR, was provided to the NTSB by the FAA. Analysis of the ADS-B and DFDR data shows that the airplane touched down about 1,000 feet from the runway threshold with a groundspeed of about 158 knots. With about 1,000 ft and 500 ft of runway remaining the airplane groundspeeds were about 72 kts and 57 kts respectively. The right turn to exit the runway was initiated at about 39 kts groundspeed and the aircraft departed the end of the paved surface at about 22 kts.METAR: weather about the incident time (1358Z): KIAH 081453Z 16005KT 1 1/2SM BR BKN008 OVC020 23/22 A2972 RMK AO2 SLP063 60002 T02280222 51014 KIAH 081353Z 19005KT 1 1/2SM BR BKN008 OVC018 23/22 A2971 RMK AO2 SFC VIS 2 1/2 SLP059 T02280217Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA24FA120 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: https://www.click2houston.com/news/local/2024/03/08/plane-goes-off-runway-at-bush-airport-no-injuries-reported/  https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/n27290#344859ac  Location  Media:So this happened todayâ¦#UnitedAirlines #imsafe #Houston #IAH #flying #plane #Memphisflight pic.twitter.com/gLKBsXnDTQâ Vicki.O (@VickiO_theDO) March 8, 2024 â¦@flightradar24â© UAL2477 (?) off the runway at IAH pic.twitter.com/d2w5g1D8Kbâ Ren Ganner (@RenGanner) March 8, 2024 Up close photos of @United Flight 2477 (Boeing 737 MAX 8) that left the runway and came to a stop in grass at George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH) in Houston. @KPRC2 has learned no one was injured. ?

The flight was a regularly scheduled passenger flight from Northwest Florida Beaches International Airport (ECP), Panama City, Florida to BWI. As a result of the turbulence, one flight attendant sustained serious injuries. The airplane was not damaged, and the flight continued to BWI without further incident.  The flight deck crew reported that they were aware of, and had received, pilot reports of turbulence at lower altitudes on arrival into BWI. They had coordinated with the cabin crew during their preflight briefing about securing the cabin early and reiterated this again (as well as asking them to take their seats afterward) just prior to starting a standard terminal arrival (the RAVNN SIX) into BWI. As they began the arrival, they learned of a pilot report of severe turbulence at flight level (FL) 250 from an airplane on arrival into nearby Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA), Arlington, Virginia.  While the cabin crew were securing the cabin and galleys, the airplane encountered severe turbulence as it descended through FL270. The captain immediately made a public address announcement to the cabin for the flight attendants to take their seats. Flight attendants B and C were âtossed aroundâ¦.sent into the airâ before landing on the floor of the aft galley. Flight attendant C sustained a hairline fracture to the left arm. A non-revenue Southwest Airlines flight attendant who was seated in the rear of the airplane rendered assistance to flight attendant C.  The captain declared a medical emergency and received an expedited approach into BWI. The first officer coordinated with airline operations and arranged for medical personnel to meet the airplane at the gate. A post-accident review of weather records revealed that there were four pilot reports of moderate to severe turbulence from FL160 to FL250 in an area to the southwest of the accident location. A high-resolution rapid refresh numerical model computed for the time and location of the accident revealed that conditions were conducive for moderate clear air turbulence from FL250 to FL280. Infrared and visible satellite imagery depicted a transverse wave cloud pattern (often observed in turbulent conditions) over the accident area. The cloud temperatures were consistent with cloud tops near 33,000 ft above mean sea level.  A graphical Airmenâs Meteorological (G-AIRMET) information Tango (turbulence), issued by the National Weather Service, valid at the time of the accident advised of occasional moderate turbulence between FL180 and FL380 for much of the mid-Atlantic and northeast states. Graphic turbulence guidance products predicted areas of moderate turbulence over central Virginia moving northwest between 1300 and 1400 eastern standard time, at FL240.

The airline transport pilot, commercial pilot, and three passengers were fatally injured. The airplane was operated by SkyJet Elite under the provisions of Title 1 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 as a personal flight. According to a representative of the operator, the flight crew itinerary for the day was for the pilots to fly from Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International Airport (FLL), Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to HSP. The passengers planned to attend a conference in Hot Springs, while the flight crew were scheduled to continue to Teterboro Airport (TEB), Teterboro, New Jersey. According to the operatorâs trip itinerary, both flights were non-revenue 14 CFR Part 91 flights. According to preliminary Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) air traffic control audio recordings and automatic dependent surveillance - broadcast (ADS-B) flight track data, the flight departed FLL about 1246 and proceeded on course to HSP. About 1430, the flight crew checked in with Washington Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC). At that time, the airplane was about 60 miles south of HSP, at flight level 210 (21,000 ft). The controller instructed the flight crew to advise when they had the current weather and NOTAM information at HSP, and to advise of which instrument approach they wanted to utilize. The flight crew acknowledged the instruction. About 1432, the controller queried the flight crew again about which approach they wanted to conduct at HSP, and if they had the current weather and NOTAMs at the airport. The flight crew responded that they had received the weather conditions at HSP airport, but the information was about an hour old, and they further advised they wanted to fly the ILS approach to runway 25. The controller subsequently cleared the flight to AHLER intersection, which was an initial fix for the ILS approach to runway 25, located about 10 miles northeast of the airport. About 1433 to 1439, the controller provided 5Â° to 10Â° right of course headings as the flight continued to AHLER intersection. The controller also instructed the flight crew to confirm they had the current weather and NOTAMs at HSP. About 1441, the flight crew advised they had the current weather and NOTAMs. About 1444, the flight crew requested to descend from 7,000 ft mean sea level (msl) to 6,000 ft msl. The controller responded by clearing the flight direct to AHLER intersection for the ILS runway 25 approach and to cross AHLER at or above 6,100 ft msl. The flight crew read back the clearance and requested radar vectors for the approach, but subsequently followed up that they were proceeding direct to AHLER and cleared for the approach. About 1447, the flight crew advised that they would cancel their IFR (instrument flight rules) flight plan once on the ground at HSP with the flight service station. The controller advised that they could still contact the controller while on the ground, and they could cancel the flight plan directly with him. Subsequently, the controller advised that there was no traffic observed between their position and the airport and to switch to the common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF). The flight crew readback the instruction and no further radio communications were recorded between the controller and the flight crew. According to an HSP airport staff member who was monitoring the CTAF, shortly before the accident he heard two radio calls from an airplane announcing that they were conducting an approach to land on runway 25. Shortly thereafter, he heard the airplaneâs impact with terrain and turned to see smoke rising from the approach end of runway 25. The airplaneâs ADS-B flight track revealed that the airplane proceeded about 15 miles northeast of the airport to conduct the ILS approach to runway 25, commencing the approach at the AHLER intersection. The airplaneâs altitude descended along the final approach course to runway 25. The final recorded ADS-B position was about 200 ft from the initial impact point with terrain. The wreckage debris path was oriented on a 250Â° to 255Â° magnetic heading and spanned about 150 ft from the initial impact point to the main wreckage. The initial impact point coincided with several trees that were located along a down sloping ravine about 300 ft from the runway threshold. The wreckage was heavily fragmented and was thermally damaged during a postimpact fire. All primary flight control surfaces and major portions of the airplane were located at the accident site. The right main landing gear was the only major portion of the airplane to have been located next to runway 25; it was located about 315 ft forward of the fuselage and about 10 ft to the right of the runway edge. Flight control continuity could not be established from the cockpit to the flight controls due to the extensive impact damage, however; continuity was observed at the flight control surfaces that remained partially intact. The configuration of the airplane at the time of impact was assessed to be landing gear down and flaps set to 40Â° as measured by actuator and jackscrew positions. The left wing outboard spoiler was observed retracted and its actuator position corresponded to a retracted position. The right wing spoilers were not identifiable due to the impact and thermal damage. The impact and thermal damage sustained to the cockpit prevented any data collection of instrument readings or switch positions. Both engines were located in the debris field with heavy impact and thermal damage observed. The left engine had separated into two pieces and the right engine remained mostly intact. Both engine spinners exhibited varying degrees of rotational scoring signatures. Both engine fan blade sections exhibited leading edge tearing, gouging, and battering damage, and several fan blades were observed to be bent opposite the direction of engine rotation. Review of the Aviation Routine Weather Reports (METARs) at the airport found two reports issued, with one issued about 20 minutes before the accident and another report issued a few minutes after the accident. At 1435, the wind was 270Â° at 21 knots, gusting to 31 knots, visibility was 10 statute miles, and no ceiling was reported. At 1455, the wind was 280Â° at 19 knots, gusting to 38 knots, visibility was 10 statute miles, and scattered clouds were reported 2,000 ft above ground level (agl), broken clouds 2,400 ft agl, and an overcast ceiling at 4,500 ft agl. According to FAA airman and operator records, the pilot in command (PIC) held an airline transport pilot certificate and held a PIC type rating in the accident airplane that was issued on January 28, 2024. The PIC was issued a first-class medical certificate on December 19, 2023, the application for which reported 13,655 total flight hours. According to an operatorâs electronic pilot logbook, a total of 65 hours, of which 55 hours were PIC hours, had been logged in the accident airplane make and model. The PIC also held the position of Chief Pilot for the operator. The second in command (SIC) held a commercial pilot certificate, with airplane single, multiengine land, and instrument airplane ratings. The SIC was issued a first-class medical certificate on April 4, 2023. He was issued a SIC type rating in the accident airplane on November 20, 2023. According to an operatorâs electronic pilot logbook, he had logged a total of 1,068 flight hours, of which 136 hours were in the accident airplane make and model as SIC. The airplaneâs cockpit voice recorder (CVR) was located in the debris and was forwarded to the National Transportation Safety Board Vehicle Recorderâs Laboratory in Washington, DC. The wreckage was retained for further examination.METAR: METAR: At 14:35 LT: METAR KHSP 101835Z AUTO 27021G31KT 10SM M02/M09 A2965 RMK AO2 T10161090 PWINO At 14:55 LT: METAR KHSP 101855Z AUTO 28019G38KT 10SM SCT020 BKN024 OVC045 M02/M08 A2965 RMK AO2 T10221078 At 15:15 LT: METAR KHSP 101915Z AUTO 27019G33KT 10SM BKN020 BKN028 OVC038 M02/M09 A2966 RMK AO2 T10211087Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA24FA136 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: https://abcnews.go.com/US/twin-engine-plane-carrying-5-crashes-virginia-airport/story?id=107982625  https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/10/us/hot-springs-virginia-plane-crash/index.html  https://www.wdbj7.com/2024/03/10/plane-crashes-ingalls-field-airport/  https://www.wsls.com/news/local/2024/03/10/plane-crashes-at-airport-in-hot-springs/  https://wset.com/news/local/wreckage-no-longer-resembles-an-aircraft-ntsb-shares-details-about-deadly-plane-crash-ingalls-field-airport-bath-county-virginia-state-police-march-2024  NTSB  https://registry.faa.gov/AircraftInquiry/Search/NNumberResult?nNumberTxt=1125A  https://www.faa.gov/about/officeorg/headquartersoffices/avs/faa-certificated-aircraft-operators-legal-part-135-holders  https://globe.adsbexchange.com/?icao=a036a9  Location  Media:NTSB investigating Sunday's crash of an Israel Aircraft Industries 1125 Westwind Astra airplane near Hot Springs, Virginia.â NTSB Newsroom (@NTSB_Newsroom) March 10, 2024 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates10-Mar-2024 20:10 Captain Adam Added 10-Mar-2024 20:43 vasilf Updated [Aircraft type, Source, ]11-Mar-2024 06:07 RobertMB Updated [Time, Aircraft type, Registration, Cn, Operator, Total fatalities, Total occupants, Phase, Nature, Departure airport, Source, Embed code, Damage, Narrative, ]11-Mar-2024 06:16 ASN Updated [Embed code, Narrative, ]11-Mar-2024 06:44 Captain Adam Updated [Source, Narrative, Category, ]11-Mar-2024 15:00 Anon.

As a result, 3 cabin crew members and 10 passengers were injured to varying degrees (1 cabin crew member, 2 passengers were hospitalised due to the seriousness of their injuries). At the time of the occurrence, the aircraft was established at FL410. The left-hand cockpit seat initiated an involuntary forward movement. The recovery of the aircraft by the flight crew from the subsequent involuntary descent condition of approximately 400 feet did not exceed the positive or negative loads allowed by the manufacturer for this type of flight condition. Weather conditions and the lack of turbulence on the route at the time of the occurrence were not causal or contributing factors in the operation.

The aircraft was equipped with legacy Soloviev D-30 engines from the Soviet era, as opposed to the newer Aviadvigatel PS-90 engine used on new-build aircraft (Il-76MD-90A). The circumstances of the aircraft crash are similar to the accident of another Il-76 in 2022: https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20220624-0Sources: https://orenburg.ru/presscenter/news/157431/  https://78.ru/news/2024-03-12/orenburgskie-letchiki-pogibli-v-rezultate-krusheniya-il76  https://t.me/bazabazon/25782  https://t.me/bazabazon/25784  https://t.me/bazabazon/25785  https://t.me/bazabazon/25786  https://t.me/bazabazon/25789  https://t.me/izvestia/163781  https://t.me/readovkanews/75588  https://t.me/warhistoryalconafter/151720  https://t.me/breakingmash/52326  https://t.me/breakingmash/52328  https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/cargo-plane-crashes-russias-ivanovo-region-brief-2024-03-12/  https://t.me/vchkogpu/46574  Location  Media:Une vidÃ©o du crash de l'Il-76 dans la rÃ©gion d'Ivanovo a Ã©tÃ© publiÃ©e.16 personnes Ã  bord mortes.La principale version est un dysfonctionnement technique.

Southwest Airlines reported that their flight attendant jumpseat positions are as follows on the 737-800 aircraft: the A and C FA's are positioned in the forward galley and the B and D FA's are positioned in the aft galley. The flight crew reported that before the flight, the captain briefed the two forward galley position FAs to expect a ârough' ride after departure on the initial climb and that if smooth air was encountered it would not last long. He also informed them of a line of convective weather that they would need to deviate through, and that they should expect turbulence until they were well clear of that weather. Although the captain was not able to meet with the two aft galley FAs before departure, he was assured that the preflight briefing would be relayed to them. The flight crew reported that the climb and initial cruise flight was turbulent; however, they briefly experienced a smooth ride for about 20 minutes before the flight was expected to encounter another area of turbulence.   The captain stated that he had notified the FA's that if they got up, he wanted them in their seats at least five minutes before the expected turbulence and provided a specific time for them to be seated. After the brief smooth ride, the flight experienced the expected continuous light to moderate turbulence as the flight crew navigated through a line of convective weather.  The turbulence persisted longer than initially anticipated, so the captain called the FA's to advise them to expect continued turbulence. At this time, the captain was informed that the D position FA had injured herself by splashing a pot of coffee onto her head, face, and shoulders.  The B position FA reported that the captain had notified the FA's that the flight might encounter turbulence and to remain seated if the rough air materialized. Due to the smooth air encountered during the initial cruise portion of the flight, the FA's were able to quickly complete a passenger service and be reseated. The B position FA recalled that the captain had asked the FA's to take their seats before the second area of turbulence was encountered. The D position FA reported that she brewed a fresh pot of hot coffee for the passengers. After brewing the coffee, she picked up the coffee pot by its handle to pour a cup. However, at that moment, the aircraft encountered turbulence, causing the coffee pot to strike a handle near the coffee machine.  As a result, hot coffee splashed on her.   Upon being notified of the injury, the captain messaged dispatch via the aircraft communications addressing and reporting system and coordinated to have medical personnel meet the airplane upon arrival at the gate. The aircraft was met by paramedics who immediately transported the injured FA to a hospital where she was diagnosed with second degree burns.

While flying direct to KRVUR, the flight crew said that Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Air Traffic Control (ATC) gave the flight permission to descend to FL 310. As the airplane was descending, it approached some clouds that were visible in the moon light, and the captain activated the seat belt sign, and made a brief announcement as a precaution. The flight crew said that they then requested that ATC allow them to deviate to the left to avoid the highest cloud peaks that they could see, however at no time did the weather radar indicate any significant moisture returns.  The flight crew said they were unable to avoid entering the clouds and the flight briefly encountered âmoderateâ turbulence. As the flight exited those cloud tops, they then saw more clouds ahead, along with some indirect lightning nearby. The captain made an announcement to the cabin for the flight attendants (FAs) to take their jump seats, and about a minute later they entered the next set of cloud tops and experienced brief, but severe turbulence. The first officer (FO) said that the turbulence encounter lasted about 10 to 15 seconds with the altitude deviating a little, and the airplane rolling about 10 to 15 degrees. He also added that the auto throttle system, increased the thrust setting, which required that they reduce it manually.  After the turbulence event, the flight crew stated that they received a call from the cabin crew notifying them that a FA was injured. The injured FA stated that after completing cabin service they stowed the beverage carts in the back galley and within one minute of stowing the carts, they encountered âvery severeâ and unexpected turbulence. He said that the seatbelt sign was off, and he could not sit in the jump seats closest to him because they were all occupied by other flight attendants. He added that the flight was full and there were no passenger seats available as well, and the only available jump seats were far away. He said that as he reached to grab a handle near the carts he was suddenly thrown by the turbulence. He hit his head on the ceiling and came down on his right foot, resulting in a broken fibula.  After the turbulence ended the flight crew gathered more information from the cabin and made a pilot report (PIREP) to ATC indicating that there was an injured FA aboard and requested that emergency medical services personnel meet the airplane at the gate.  The first officer added that from his perspective, there was no indication of possible turbulence in the vicinity, and if it wasn't for the moon light making the clouds visible, the seat belt sign would most likely have not been activated, because the radar showed no reflection of moisture in the clouds. Probable Cause: An inadvertent encounter with convective turbulence that resulted in a serious injury to a flight attendant.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA24LA135 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=194001  https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/n6705y#34898192  https://www.flightaware.com/live/flight/DAL1253/history/20240328/0240Z/KATL/KTPA  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates28-Mar-2024 15:21 ASN Added 29-Mar-2024 10:28 ASN Updated [Time, Location, ]29-Mar-2024 10:29 ASN Updated [Category, ]17-May-2024 16:11 Captain Adam Updated [Time, Total occupants, Location, Source, Accident report, ]18-Jan-2025 13:07 Captain Adam Updated [Source, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

Of the 5 crew and 140 passengers onboard, one flight attendant and one passenger sustained serious injuries, and one flight attendant sustained minor injuries. The aircraft was not damaged. The flight was operating under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 as a scheduled passenger flight. The day of the accident, a major cold front was traversing the southeastern United States. The squall line of rapidly developing thunderstorms associated with the front extended south several hundred miles into the Gulf of Mexico. A convective Significant Meteorological Information (SIGMET) was issued at 1155 UTC for the area, warning pilots of cloud tops above 45,000 ft. A post-accident review of the weather showed a rapidly developing cell in the area of the accident consistent with the accident pilotsâ recollection described in the next paragraph. The captain stated that when he met with the flight attendants before departure and briefed them on the weather conditions, they agreed that, at the 10,000 ft chime, the flight attendants would decide amongst themselves if the ride was smooth enough to start their inflight service. The captain informed them that if the ride became too uncomfortable that they should take their jump seats and let the cockpit know that they were seated. As the aircraft climbed to altitude, the aircraft encountered occasional chop. They leveled the aircraft at flight level (FL) 370, above the weather system with the tops of the clouds at FL340 â FL350. The fasten seatbelt sign remained illuminated the entire flight. About 40 minutes into the flight and approaching the REMIS waypoint, the flight began to encounter light turbulence and the crew began deviations around cells before waypoint ROZZI. The visibility was intermittent instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) and marginal visual meteorological conditions (VMC) with occasional light chop. As they returned to their route to REMIS, the visibility improved and they visually acquired a rapidly developing cloud top that was on their flight path, but not painting on the onboard radar. The captain made a passenger announcement to ensure those in the cabin were seated and then contacted air traffic control (ATC) to request the deviation. The first officer (FO) began a right turn to avoid the cell, however, was not able to complete the turn in time and entered the cloud buildup. They encountered severe turbulence that lasted about 10 seconds that resulted in fluctuations up to 30Â°of bank, 20 knots airspeed, and 200 ft of altitude. Moderate turbulence followed for about 1 minute. According to flight data, vertical acceleration ranged from -0.45 gravitational force equivalent (g) to +1.8g during the turbulence encounter. Following the event, the flight crew coordinated with dispatch and decided to divert to Tampa International Airport (TPA), Tampa, Florida. They informed ATC of their intentions and were routed to TPA where they performed an uneventful landing, and medical personnel met the aircraft at the gate. The following NTSB specialists were assigned to investigate the accident: air traffic control, meteorology, and flight data recorder. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Southwest Airlines, and the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) are parties to the investigation. The flight data recorder data for the flight was downloaded by the operator and sent to NTSB headquarters for analysis. This analysis is ongoing. At the time of the encounter with turbulence, the aircraft was in Jacksonville (JAX) Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) airspace. While crew statements indicated they were aware of and monitoring rapidly developing cells, ATC audio indicated that the air traffic controller overseeing the flight did not provide specific information about the developing weather cell the aircraft penetrated to encounter the accident turbulence. NTSB investigators travelled to JAX ARTCC and conducted interviews of ATC personnel controlling the flight during the turbulence encounter. The investigation found that while the target number of aircraft for the sector was set at 20 (down from 23 due to increased complexity), the controller had significantly more aircraft on the frequency in the timeframe surrounding the accident. The controllerâs workload was further increased due to technical limitations with the temporary very high frequency (VHF) communications antenna the ARTCC was relying on to communicate with traffic after the primary VHF antenna was rendered inoperative in a fire in October 2023. FAA telecommunications infrastructure (FTI) had provided a satellite relay connection to assist with provision of operational frequencies, typically used in case of emergency situations. This caused a delay of transmission by 600 milliseconds round trip, resulting in clipped communication with a number of aircraft on the frequency. The controller described that these limitations required him to issue multiple repeated calls to multiple aircraft on the frequency increasing his workload and frequency congestion. The investigation is continuing.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA24FA143 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: https://www.kitv.com/news/national/passenger-flight-attendant-injured-during-severe-turbulence-on-southwest-flight/article_a9583e2a-1e0f-5752-8edc-fa72a4834b1e.html  NTSB  https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/n567wn#349dff56  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates04-Apr-2024 06:48 ASN Added 04-Apr-2024 06:48 ASN Updated [Aircraft type, ]04-Apr-2024 13:55 ASN Updated [Total occupants, Source, Narrative, ]17-May-2024 16:06 Captain Adam Updated [Time, Total occupants, Source, Narrative, Category, Accident report, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The captain reported he recognized the flight might encounter turbulence since he had encountered it on his previous flight. He stated that during the preflight briefing he informed the cabin crew to remain seated because they were expecting rough air, and it was a short flight. The captain reported that the departure and cruise segments of the flight were smooth and uneventful. On descent, around 14,000 feet, the aircraft encountered moderate turbulence before going into a cloud layer. Following the encounter, the first officer called the lead flight attendant (FA) to ensure everyone was ok while the captain asked air traffic control (ATC) for a right turn to avoid an approaching cloud buildup. The lead FA first reported that everything was ok, however shortly after the initial call, she called again to report that one of the FAs might have a broken leg. The injured FA stated that she was seated in the back of the aircraft and completing her last safety check when the turbulence lifted her out of her seat, and she landed forcefully on her right leg. Another flight attendant hit her head on the ceiling and fell, hurting her lower back. The captain transferred flight and communication duties to the first officer while the captain coordinated paramedics for the arrival into AVL. The captain then reported the turbulence to ATC and reassumed flight duty. The aircraft landed and arrived at the gate with no further issues. The paramedics met the airplane at the gate, and the seriously injured flight attendant was transported to the hospital and diagnosed with multiple fractures in her right leg. Post accident weather analysis suggested that the turbulence was likely caused by windshear associated with an upper front. A pilot from a different flight had reported moderate turbulence between 11,000 and 8,000 feet in a nearby area. However, there were no active advisories for turbulence in the location where the accident aircraft encountered turbulence. Probable Cause: An encounter with clear air turbulence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA24LA144 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=194029  https://www.flightaware.com/live/flight/N899AT/history/20240403/0255Z/KATL/KAVL/tracklog  https://www.flightaware.com/live/flight/N899AT/history/20240403/1010Z/KAVL/KATL  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates29-Apr-2024 12:59 ASN Added 29-Apr-2024 13:00 ASN Updated [Departure airport, Destination airport, Narrative, ]29-Apr-2024 13:00 ASN Updated 17-May-2024 15:59 Captain Adam Updated [Time, Total occupants, Location, Phase, Departure airport, Destination airport, Narrative, Category, Accident report, ]16-Oct-2024 16:54 Captain Adam Updated [Source, Narrative, ]21-Oct-2024 08:29 ASN Updated [Accident report, ] Corrections or additions? ...

There were no injuries. The first officer (FO) was the pilot flying and the captain was the pilot monitoring on the flight. The flight crew had initially planned and set up for landing on runway 17L, but just before the descent, they were informed that the active runway had changed to runway 35R. They briefed the area navigation (required navigation performance) (RNAV [RNP]) Y approach for runway 35R before the descent. The approach was typical, with light turbulence in the descent. At approximately 6100 feet ASL, the landing gear was extended, flaps were set to 15Â°, and the propellers were set to 1020 rpm for landing. The approach speed was established at 132 knots indicated airspeed. The surface winds were reported to be from 330Â° at 10 knots, gusting to 20 knots. No additive for the gust was made to the approach speed. The autopilot was turned off at 500 feet above ground level (AGL) and the remainder of the approach was hand flown by the FO. From 500 feet AGL to touchdown, the power levers were adjusted up and down 12 times between 22% torque and 4% torque. Once below 350 feet AGL on approach, the aircraftâs descent path varied above and below the 3Â° approach descent path. During this time, the captain made 3 calls to the FO to increase power. The FO responded by increasing power each time; however, the last increase in power was quickly followed by a reduction in power to 4% torque. The aircraft crossed the runway 35R threshold at 65 feet AGL. Over the next 6 seconds, the aircraft experienced a performance-degrading wind gust with an approximate speed of 8 knots. The FO began to increase the nose-up attitude to start the flare, slowing the aircraft to 120 knots calibrated airspeed. Two seconds before touchdown, the pitch attitude increased from 5Â° to 8.3Â° and the power levers were advanced. At touchdown, the power increased to 8% torque, and then up to 18% torque after touchdown. At 14:52:26, the aft fuselage of the aircraft contacted the runway approximately 1070 feet beyond the threshold.METAR: CYYC 131900Z VRB02KT 40SM FEW079 BKN250 14/M07 A2980 RMK AC1CI6 CONTRAILS SLP108 DENSITY ALT 4500FT CYYC 132000Z 27003KT 190V330 40SM FEW090 FEW190 BKN250 15/M07 A2978 RMK AC1AC2CI5 AC TR CONTRAILS SLP104 DENSITY ALT 4700FT CYYC 132100Z 33012G20KT 260V350 40SM FEW110 BKN200 17/M08 A2978 RMK AC1CC7 AC TR SLP102 DENSITY ALT 4800FTAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A24W0038 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: TSB A24W0038  https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/c-gjwe#34c2b0df History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  15 February 2019 C-GJWE WestJet Encore 0 Fort St. John Airport, BC (YXJ/CYXJ) min Collision with Ground support equipment 28 September 2021 C-GJWE WestJet 0 37 nm SSE of Terrace, BC non Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates05-Jun-2024 19:07 ASN Added 05-Jun-2024 19:08 ASN Updated [Time, Location, Source, Damage, ]05-Jun-2024 19:09 ASN Updated 26-Nov-2024 19:40 ASN Updated [Total occupants, Accident report, ]26-Nov-2024 20:17 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

According to the pilots, a pilot-in-command proficiency check flight was being conducted, with a designated pilot examiner utilizing the flight deck jump seat. Prior to performing a simulated single engine approach to runway 17 at Ravalli County Airport (HRF), Hamilton, Montana, the pilot in command (PIC) noticed that the hydraulic reservoir display was âat the bottom limit in the yellow arc.â All pre-landing checklist items were completed, including brake function checks.  After landing on runway 17, during the landing roll, the airplane began to veer right of centerline, and the PIC added left rudder correction. A vibration developed and increased as the airplane continued to veer to the right. Despite the PICâs application of left brake and additional rudder inputs, the airplane continued to veer right, exited the runway, and struck a runway light, taxiway light and taxiway sign.

The two pilots were fatally injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 flight.  The accident airplane, owned and operated by Alaska Air Fuel, Inc., was transporting 3,400 gallons of unleaded fuel and two 100-gallon propane tanks. The airplane departed from the Fairbanks International Airport (FAI) at about 0955 Alaska daylight time (AKDT) with a destination of the Kobuk Airport (OBU) Kobuk, Alaska. Shortly after takeoff an eyewitness reported seeing the airplane flying to the west, with the far left engine (No. 1) not running. The witness also noticed a small, white plume of smoke coming from that engine. The witness reported the airplane began a turn to the south at which point he noticed the engine was on fire. Recovered surveillance video shows white smoke behind the number one engine, followed by flames. The video also revealed that seconds later a bright white explosion is seen just behind the number one engine followed by fragments of airplane wreckage falling to the ground. The airplane then begins an uncontrolled descending left turn into terrain. The No. 1 engine separated from the wing about 100 ft above the ground and eventually came to rest on the frozen Tanana River.  A preliminary review of archived voice communication information from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) revealed that shortly after departure from FAI at 1,000, the pilot contacted the departure air traffic control (ATC) specialist on duty, stating that there was âa fire on boardâ and that they needed to return to the airport.  The accident airplane was equipped with Automatic Dependent SurveillanceâBroadcast (ADSâ B), which provides aircraft position information via satellite navigation or other sensors and periodically broadcasts it, enabling the aircraft to be tracked. The information can be received by air traffic control ground stations as a replacement for secondary surveillance radar, as no interrogation signal is needed from the ground. According to archived FAA ADS-B data, after the airplane departed FAI, it initially proceeded southwest, then it turned westbound. The airplane then began a left turn back to FAI. The ADSB data eventually stopped near where the witness observed the accident airplane impact terrain.  The accident airplane was also equipped was Spidertracks. Spidertracks enables real-time flight tracking, automated flight watch, two-way communication, and flight data monitoring (FDM) for aircraft. The operatorâs archived Spidertracks data has been collected for further analysis.  A large postcrash fire ensued, which incinerated much of the airplane's structure. The No.1 engine was recovered, and a detailed engine examination is pending.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ANC24FA029 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/douglas-dc-4-plane-crash-fairbanks-alaska/  https://alaskapublic.org/2024/04/23/rescuers-responding-to-plane-crash-along-tanana-river-near-fairbanks/  https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/plane-crash-fairbanks-alaska-rescue-b2533569.html  https://abc7news.com/alaska-news-pilot-reported-fire-onboard-plane-carrying-fuel-attempted-to-return-fairbanks-just-before-crash/14729111/?ex_cid=TA_KGO_TW&taid=6629e363029dc600017ab569  NTSB  https://registry.faa.gov/AircraftInquiry/Search/NNumberResult?nNumberTxt=N3054V  https://www.flightaware.com/live/flight/N3054V/history/20240423/1816Z/PAFA/L%2064.74248%20-148.08014~  https://cdn.jetphotos.com/full/5/2935864_1688407807.jpg (photo) History of this aircraft Ex N76AU, N62296, US Navy Bu:91994, Royal Air Force KL977, USAAF 42-72442 Location  Images: N3054V at Wasilla, June 2023; photo: King Hui (CC:by-sa) Media:A Douglas C-54 operated by Alaska Air Fuel, was destroyed when it crashed into a hill on the bank of the Tanana River, about six minutes after takeoff from Fairbanks International Airport, Alaska.

Hobby Airport (HOU/KHOU), Houston, TX -   United States of America","Landing","Passenger - Scheduled","Dallas-Love Field, TX (DAL/KDAL)","Houston-William P. Hobby Airport, TX (HOU/KHOU)"," NTSB","Information verified through data from accident investigation authorities","On May 3, 2024, about 1800 central daylight time (CDT), Delux Public Charter, doing business as JSX flight 284, an Embraer EMB-145LR experienced a left main landing gear (LMLG) collapse during landing at Houston Hobby International Airport (HOU), Houston, Texas. Of the 3 crew and 21 passengers onboard, one crew member sustained minor injuries. The aircraft was substantially damaged. The flight was a public charter sold by JSX, as the charter operator (subject to provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 380) and operated by Delux Public Charter, LLC as the direct air carrier (operating under the provisions of Title 14 CFR Part 135) as a nonscheduled passenger flight from Dallas Love Field airport (DAL), Dallas, Texas to HOU. The flight crew described an uneventful takeoff, climb, cruise, and descent. The flight data indicated the airspeed, vertical speed, and glide path were stabilized during the majority of the final approach. Surface winds during the approach at HOU were reported from 130 degrees at 16 knots, gusting to 24 knots. As the aircraft flew over the threshold of runway 4 at HOU, the flight crew described a feeling that there was something wrong, and the captain, who was the pilot flying, called for a go-around. The aircraft landed hard shortly thereafter. While the crew did not recall initiating the go-around, flight data showed an increase in throttle lever angle consistent with commanding go-around thrust that began shortly before impact. Flight data indicated that the vertical load factor during the touchdown was 3.9 gravitational constants (g). As the aircraft continued down the runway, the LMLG collapsed and punctured through the left-wing upper skin. The aircraft came to a stop on the left side of the runway about 567 ft from the end. Emergency personnel responded to the accident and assisted the passengers as they deplaned through the main cabin door (L1). The first officer was transported to a local hospital for minor injuries. Visual inspection of the LMLG showed structural damage and deformation, in addition to hydraulic fluid leakage. The left wing spar III, a principal structural element, was bent and fractured through at 2 locations and partially fractured at 3 additional locations. While there was damage to some of the left wingâs structural components, the fuel tank was not compromised during the event. Most of the structural damage to the inboard section of the wing was consistent with a strong upward force from the LMLG. Damage to the outboard section of the wing was consistent with the wing scraping the runway surface and impacting runway lights. The following NTSB specialists were assigned to investigate the accident: Airworthiness, Operations, Human Performance, Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR), and Flight Data Recorder (FDR). The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Delux Public Charter are parties to the investigation. The airplane was designed and manufactured in Brazil, and pursuant to International Civil Aviation Organization Annex 13, Centro de InvestigaÃ§Ã£o e PrevenÃ§Ã£o de Acidentes AeronÃ¡uticos (CENIPA) assigned an Accredited Representative to the investigation and designated Embraer as a technical advisor. The CVR and FDR were removed from the aircraft by NTSB investigators and were shipped to NTSB headquarters in Washington, DC where they were successfully downloaded. The aircraft wreckage was documented during the on-scene portion of the investigation and flight crew interviews were conducted via video conference on May 5, 2024.  The investigation continues.METAR: KHOU 032353Z 13009KT 10SM BKN100 BKN250 26/20 A2984 RMK AO2 SLP111 60006 T02560200 10272 20239 56019 KHOU 032253Z 13016G24KT 10SM SCT100 BKN250 26/20 A2985 RMK AO2 SLP112 T02610200Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA24FA179 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: https://www.fox26houston.com/news/small-plane-at-hobby-airport-has-landing-gear-collapse  https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/n942jx#350dbd1e  NTSB  Location  Media: Plane safely arrives at Hobby Airport after experiencing landing gear collapse, officials say https://t.co/aUEl12GKegâ ABC13 Houston (@abc13houston) May 4, 2024 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates04-May-2024 05:24 gerard57 Added 04-May-2024 06:27 ASN Updated [Aircraft type, Registration, Cn, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, ]04-May-2024 06:29 ASN Updated [Time, Location, Narrative, ]04-May-2024 06:31 ASN Updated [Embed code, ]04-May-2024 16:00 Aerossurance Updated [Embed code, ]05-May-2024 13:32 Captain Adam Updated [Location, Embed code, Damage, Narrative, Category, ]18-Jun-2024 23:00 Captain Adam Updated [Time, Source, Narrative, Accident report, ] Corrections or additions? ...

One passenger died, 30 other occupants suffered injuries requiring hospital treatment.  At 07:49:21 UTC the aircraft was passing over the south of Myanmar at 37,000 ft and likely flying over an area of developing convective activity. The Gravitational force (G), recorded as vertical accelerations, fluctuated between positive (+ve) 0.44G and +ve 1.57G for a period of about 19 seconds. This would have caused the flight to begin to experience slight vibration. Around the same time as the onset of the slight vibration, an uncommanded increase in aircraft altitude, reaching a peak of 37,362 ft, was recorded. In response to this uncommanded altitude increase, the autopilot pitched the aircraft downwards to descend back to the selected altitude of 37,000 ft.  In addition, the pilots observed an uncommanded increase in airspeed which they arrested by extending the speed brakes. While managing the airspeed, at 07:49:32 hr, it was heard that a pilot called out that the fasten seat belt sign had been switched on. This uncommanded increase in aircraft altitude and airspeed were most likely due to the aircraft being acted upon by an updraft (the upward movement of air). The autopilot was engaged during this period.  At 07:49:40 hr, the aircraft experienced a rapid change in G as recorded vertical acceleration decreased from +ve 1.35G to negative (-ve) 1.5G, within 0.6 sec. This likely resulted in the occupants who were not belted up to become airborne. At 07:49:41 hr, the vertical acceleration changed from -ve 1.5G to +ve 1.5G within 4 sec. This likely resulted in the occupants who were airborne to fall back down. The rapid changes in G over the 4.6 sec duration resulted in an altitude drop of 178 ft, from 37,362 ft to 37,184 ft. This sequence of events likely caused the injuries to the crew and passengers. In the midst of the sequence of rapid changes in G, recorded data indicated that the pilots initiated control inputs to stabilise the aircraft, disengaging the autopilot in this process. The pilots manually controlled the aircraft for 21 sec and reengaged the autopilot at 07:50:05 hr. The recorded vertical acceleration showed more gradual fluctuations over the next 24 sec, ranging from +ve 0.9G to +ve 1.1G, while the aircraft returned to 37,000 ft at 07:50:23 hr. After the pilots were informed by the cabin crew that there were injured passengers in the cabin, the decision was made to divert to Suvarnabhumi Airport, Bangkok, Thailand. On the way to Bangkok, the pilots requested for medical services to meet the aircraft on arrival. Approximately 17 minutes after the turbulence event, at 08:06:51 hr, the pilots initiated a normal, controlled descent from 37,000 ft and the aircraft reached 31,000 ft at 08:10:00 hr. The data showed that the aircraft did not encounter further severe turbulence during this diversion, and touched down in Suvarnabhumi Airport at 08:45:12 hr.Sources: https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/9v-swm#354eb60f  https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fsingaporeair%2Fposts%2Fpfbid01ETziy2xcUF8R5CKeg8CoKsqHsVHhhhw5Cp9UxvefpWmzCetfit82Xa2nUQ8LqVVl&show_text=true&width=500&is_preview=true  https://www.mot.gov.sg/news/details/transport-safety-investigation-bureau-preliminary-investigation-findings-of-incident-involving-sq321  Location  Media:Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates21-May-2024 11:32 TomPouce67 Added 21-May-2024 11:34 ASN Updated [Aircraft type, Cn, Operator, Source, Embed code, ]21-May-2024 11:36 ASN Updated [Narrative, ]21-May-2024 15:36 ASN Updated [Time, Location, Country, Narrative, Category, ]29-May-2024 16:13 ASN Updated [Source, Damage, Narrative, ]30-Dec-2024 16:33 Anon.

The aircraft departed Mzuzu Airport (ZZU) at 07:04  local time, and arrived at Lilongwe Airport (LLW) at 07:52.  The airplane was refuelled and the six passengers, among them the Vice President of Malawi, boarded the aircraft. The flight took off from LLW at 09:16 and received climb clearance to FL90. Later, the flight crew requested to maintain 7,000 ft AMSL. At about 09:23 the airplane reached a cruise level of about 7,300 ft (GPS altitude). At 09:50 hrs the aircraft began to deviate from the direct course to ZZU by entering a left-hand turn. From  then on the flight followed an erratic course at varying altitudes and several 360 degree turns. At 10:12 hrs, the flight crew had reported in on the Mzuzu Tower frequency and informed him that they were 20 NM away and intended an approach from the north. The Flight Information Officer communicated the weather information and that runway 17 was in use. He also informed them about his observation that east, south and west of the airport visibility was about 5 km.  Four minutes later the aircraft impacted a hillside, 34 km (18 NM) south-west of ZZU. First, the aircraft collided with the trunk of a tree with the outer part of the right wing at a height of about 4.5 m above ground. The airplaneâs lower fuselage surface then impacted the ground and the aircraft broke up until the main wreckage had come to rest on the slope about 80 m from the tree.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BFU Report number: BFU24-0508-DX Status: Preliminary reportDuration: 2 monthsDownload report:  Preliminary report Sources: https://mwnation.com/veep-chilimas-plane-goes-missing/  https://www.nyasatimes.com/teary-malawians-wait-with-unabated-breath-as-rescue-mission-continue-to-search-for-chilimas-missing-aircraft/  https://www.faceofmalawi.com/2024/06/11/chilima-dies-in-plane-crash/  https://malawi24.com/2024/06/11/chilima-crash-site-identified/  https://www.maravipost.com/tragic-malawi-veep-saulos-chilima-nine-others-die-in-plane-crash/  https://www.maravipost.com/mdf-confirms-chilimas-plane-crashed-in-chikangawa-forest/  https://www.africanews.com/2024/06/12/malawi-announces-state-funeral-and-21-days-of-mourning-for-vice-president-killed-in-a-plan/  https://www.bfu-web.de/DE/Home/Nachrichten/100724_Untersuchung_Malawi.html  https://www.scramble.nl/database/civil/details/do228_153  https://imgproc.airliners.net/photos/airliners/3/0/3/1096303.jpg (photo)  Images: Photo: BFU Media:Imaged below showing The missing plane in chikangawa forest..#breakingnews #malawi #missingplane #MbuziTvMw pic.twitter.com/zwXoTwJ9RDâ MbuziTv (@MbuziTvMw) June 11, 2024 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates10-Jun-2024 16:23 4Holerpoler Added 10-Jun-2024 16:25 ASN Updated [Aircraft type, Total fatalities, Location, Source, Damage, Narrative, ]10-Jun-2024 17:32 Ephata Updated [Country, ]11-Jun-2024 05:35 lagi Updated [Aircraft type, Registration, Cn, Source, Embed code, Narrative, ]11-Jun-2024 07:45 lagi Updated [Registration, Source, ]11-Jun-2024 09:54 Iceman 29 Updated [Total fatalities, Source, Embed code, Damage, ]11-Jun-2024 12:32 Rod K Updated [Embed code, Narrative, ]11-Jun-2024 14:12 lagi Updated [Location, Source, Embed code, Narrative, ]21-Jun-2024 08:40 luca Updated [Total fatalities, Total occupants, Source, Narrative, ]13-Jul-2024 14:20 ASN Updated [Source, Narrative, Photo, ]30-Aug-2024 11:24 ASN Updated [Time, Accident report, ]30-Aug-2024 16:33 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

On final approach to runway 19 the aircraft collided with a snow barrier 955 m short of the runway. It then touched down at 2.2 G with the left wing impacting the snow barrier. The aircraft swung and came to rest with the fuselage broken in two. The pilot-in-command, co-pilot and a passenger were seriously injured. Meteorological conditions at the time of the incident: visibility 2400 m, significant cloud haze 90 m, wind 8 m/s. Passengers were evacuated to the airport terminal building. The PIC, co-pilot and passenger (woman) were provided with medical assistance.  Utrenny Airport was constructed to allow shift workers to be flown to the Arctic LNG 2 project. Conclusion:  The aviation accident involving the An-26-100 RA-26662 aircraft occurred during the day, during an approach for landing in meteorological conditions below the established minimum operational limit of the airport. This resulted in the aircraft landing approximately 955 meters short of the runway threshold and colliding with a snow barrier.  Contributing factors included:  - The decision by the flight commander to continue the flight to the destination airport and to execute the landing approach, despite having information about meteorological conditions at the destination airport below the established operational minimum; - The crew's failure to maintain flight parameters that meet the criteria for a stabilized approach to landing, as well as their failure to go around when these were not met; - Descending below the established minimum descent altitude (MDA/H) with insufficient visual contact with ground landmarks necessary for making a landing decision; - The flight commander's (crew's) error in recognizing the runway and its landmarks; - Breakdowns in coordination, as well as insufficient crew resource management by the flight commander.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: https://t.me/aviaincident/32263  https://t.me/uraltransprok/5553  https://t.me/aviatorshina/4787  https://mak-iac.org/rassledovaniya/an-26-100-ra-26662-14-06-2024/  Preliminary Report: https://mak-iac.org/upload/iblock/bc9/8phss16w68qia8547ra6mt64nrxs49wi/pr_report_ra-26662.pdf  Final Report: https://mak-iac.org/upload/iblock/ff4/0dbgek9yrtmpufli1gaknx9e20pjn1mm/report_ra-26662.pdf   Location  Images: Photo: Ural Transport Prosecutor's Office Photo: MAK Media:#BREAKING ð·ðºâï¸| Russian An-26-100 made an emergency landing in Yamal.

While at cruise altitude, the Pilot Flying (the captain) briefed the area navigation global navigation satellite system (RNAV [GNSS]) Z approach to Runway 27. Based on the landing weight and the flaps set at 15Â°, the planned target landing reference speed (VREF) was 124 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS), and the flight crew added a 10-knot buffer, increasing the planned approach speed to 134 KIAS. At 1356, the flight was cleared to land, and the control tower reported the winds to be from 350Â° magnetic at 11 knots. At 13:59:30, when the aircraft was 267 feet above touchdown zone elevation (TDZE), the PF disconnected the autopilot and began to fly the approach manually. When the aircraft was 135 feet above the TDZE, the aircraft was travelling at 126 KIAS, the descent rate was 700 fpm, and the pitch was 3.2Â°. When the aircraft was 20 feet above the TDZE, it was travelling at 124 KIAS, the descent rate had increased to 980 fpm, and the pitch was 1.1Â°. The headwind component decreased from 5.5 knots to 0.5 knots within 3 seconds, increasing the maximum descent rate to 1050 fpm. In response, over a period of 2 seconds, the PF increased the pitch from 1.1Â° to 6.8Â°. The power was consistently at 14% torque. At 13:59:53, the right main landing gear contacted the runway, followed by the left main landing gear. A vertical acceleration of 3.51 g was recorded. After the initial contact with the runway, the aircraft bounced, and the flight crew initiated a go-around in accordance with Porter Airlinesâ standard operating procedures (SOPs). Two seconds later, a second runway contact occurred with a recorded vertical acceleration of 1.42 g. After the first touchdown, the TOUCHED RUNWAY warning light illuminated, indicating that a sensor near the tail section of the aircraft had been triggered by contact with the runway surface. In addition, the master warning light started flashing. During the climbout, the flight crew noticed the master warning and TOUCHED RUNWAY warning lights; however, they did not discuss the issue further at that time. The flight crew were cleared by the tower controller to conduct a visual flight rules circuit and return to land. The aircraft landed uneventfully at 1408, and the flight crew taxied the aircraft to the apron and shut it down. Damage to the lower portion of the aft fuselage section was identified and company flight operations personnel were notified.METAR: CYFC 281600Z AUTO 33015G20KT 9SM SCT066 SCT075 21/07 A2996 RMK SLP147 DENSITY ALT 700FT CYFC 281700Z AUTO 32014KT 9SM BKN071 BKN080 21/10 A2997 RMK SLP152 DENSITY ALT 800FT CYFC 281800Z AUTO 30009G16KT 9SM FEW066 21/08 A2998 RMK SLP153 DENSITY ALT 800FTAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A24A0038 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: https://www.reddit.com/r/rampagent/comments/1dqps00/just_witnessed_my_first_q400_tail_strike_at_work/  https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/c-glqp#35e5e56a Media:A Porter Airlines Dash 8-400 damaged following a tail-strike while landing at Fredericton Airport, Canada.Photo: Respective OwnerTelegram Channel: https://t.co/KUkXqwLO2W pic.twitter.com/XipAlwvw8vâ AviatorsMaldives (@AviatorsMaldive) June 29, 2024 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates03-Jul-2024 05:34 ASN Added 03-Jul-2024 05:35 ASN Updated [Location, Embed code, Narrative, ]16-Jul-2024 14:08 ASN Updated [Total occupants, Damage, Narrative, ]06-Feb-2025 15:25 ASN Updated [Narrative, Accident report, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The pilot continued the approach and while in visual flight rules conditions and noted rain over the runway about 1,000 ft from the threshold. The pilot landed the airplane on the grooved asphalt runway and observed that there was no standing water. During the landing roll, the airplane encountered heavy rain and the pilot stated that it began âhydroplaningâ toward the right side of the runway. The right wing of the airplane then impacted 3 edge lights and one location sign before the pilot was able to regain control and then taxi off the runway and to the ramp. The airplaneâs right wing was substantially damaged during the accident sequence. The pilot stated that there preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures of the airplane that would have precluded normal operation. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that there was no evidence of tread rubber reversion on either main landing gear tire that would be associated with hydroplaning during landing.

A safe landing was made back at SOC 80 minutes after takeoff. While climbing through FL343 to the intended cruising altitude of FL380, the aircraft experienced an engine malfunction. The ECAM indicated 'ENG 1 STALL', and immediately a strong vibration was felt, followed by the 'ENG1 Fail' indication on the ECAM. After performing the ECAM procedures, the flight crew decided to return to Solo with engine no.1 inoperative. During descent, the vibration level was not reduced. While approaching Solo, a spurious 'ENG 1 fire' appeared on the ECAM with 'ENG 1 LOOP B FAULT', but no fire was observed on the engine during visual check by the other crewmembers. The aircraft landed and stopped on the runway, then after a few minutes, smoke, fire and flames appeared on the engine no. 1.Sources: https://twitter.com/GerryS/status/1808139448326279252  https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/t7-mmm#35f48d5e  https://bea.aero/en/investigation-reports/notified-events/detail/accident-to-the-airbus-a330-registered-t7-mmm-operated-by-garuda-on-02-07-2024-at-surakarta/ History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  22 May 2020 B-LNM Hong Kong Airlines 0 Hong Kong International Airport non Runway incursion Images: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates02-Jul-2024 15:56 ASN Added 02-Jul-2024 17:56 Anon.

The airplane landed on runway 28L at PDX without further incident, and all occupants (2 flight crewmembers, 4 cabin crewmembers, and 171 passengers) deplaned at the gate. Seven passengers and one flight attendant received minor injuries. The flight was operated under Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 121 as a scheduled domestic passenger flight from PDX to Ontario, California (ONT). âââ â The separation of the MED plug from the airplane adversely affected the pressurization performance of the airplane and the damage to the MED plug adversely affected its structural strength, requiring replacement of the MED plug, resulting in a classification of substantial damage in accordance with Title 49 CFR Part 830. Both flight crewmembers held airline transport pilot (ATP) certificates. The captain had accumulated about 12,700 hours of flight experience, of which about 6,500 were in the accident airplane make and model. The first officer (FO) had accumulated about 8,300 hours total flight experience, of which about 1,500 were in the accident airplane make and model. The captain was the pilot flying and the FO was the pilot monitoring. The flight crew stated that the preflight inspection, engine start, taxi, takeoff, and departure climb were unremarkable. After takeoff, the flight crew checked in with Seattle Air Route Traffic Control Center and was cleared to flight level (FL)230 [23,000 feet]. The captain said that, while climbing through about 16,000 ft, there was a loud bang. The flight crew said their ears popped, and the captain said his head was pushed into the heads-up display (HUD) and his headset was pushed up, nearly falling off his head. The FO said her headset was completely removed due to the rapid outflow of air from the flight deck. Both flight crew said they immediately donned their oxygen masks. They added that the flight deck door was blown open and that it was very noisy and difficult to communicate. The flight crew immediately contacted air traffic control (ATC), declared an emergency, and requested a lower altitude. The flight was assigned 10,000 ft. The captain said he then requested the rapid decompression checklist, and the FO executed the required checklist from the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH). As the FO completed the checklist, the captain flew the airplane as they coordinated with ATC to return to the PDX airport. The flight landed on runway 28L without further incident and taxied to the gate. The CVR and FDR were removed from the airplane and brought to the NTSBâs Vehicle Recorder Laboratory in Washington, DC, for download of the data. The accident airplane was required to be equipped with a CVR that retained, at minimum, the last 2 hours of audio information, including flight crew communications and other sounds inside the cockpit. A CVR starts recording when the aircraft is powered on and will continue to record until the aircraft is powered down or the CVR is deactivated, either by a loss of electrical power after a major event or by manually deactivating the CVRâs circuit breaker after a less severe event. The CVR was downloaded successfully; however, it was determined that the audio from the accident flight had been overwritten. The CVR circuit breaker had not been manually deactivated after the airplane landed following the accident in time to preserve the accident flight recording. The accident airplane was required to be equipped with an FDR that recorded, at a minimum, 91 parameters and 25 hours of data. The accident airplaneâs FDR was successfully downloaded and had about 1800 parameters and was 68 hours in length. It contained 16.5 flights, and the oldest recorded flight was from December 30, 2023. A summary of the FDR data is as follows: o 17:06:47 PST: The airplane departed runway 28L at PDX. o 17:12:33 PST: The recorded cabin pressure dropped from 14.09 to 11.64 pounds per square inch (psi) when the airplane was at an altitude of about 14,830 ft and speed of 271 knots (kts). The âCabin Altitude Greater than (>) 10k ft Warningâ activated. Differential pressure was at 5.7 psi and rapidly decreased to 0 psi over the next few seconds o 17:12:34 PST: The Master Caution activated. The cabin pressure dropped to 9.08 psi at approximately 14,850 ft and 271 kts. The airplane magnetic heading was 123Â°. o 17:12:52 PST: The Master Caution deactivated. o 17:13:41 PST: The airplane continued to climb and reached a maximum altitude of 16,320 ft and began to descend. The airspeed was 276 kts on a magnetic heading of 120Â°. o 17:13:56 PST: The Selected Altitude changed from 23,000 ft to 10,000 ft. o 17:14:35 PST: The Master Caution activated for 3 seconds. o 17:16:56 PST: The airplane began a left turn from 121Â°. The altitude was approximately 10,120 ft. o 17:17:00 PST: The airplane descended below 10,000 ft. o 17:18:05 PST: The airplane altitude was approximately 9,050 ft and the airspeed was 271 kts. The âCabin Altitude Greater than (>) 10k ft Warningâ deactivated. The cabin pressure was 10.48 psi. o 17:26:46 PST: The airplane landed on runway 28L at PDX.  The airplane was equipped with a MED plug option, which Alaska Airlines had selected based on its desired seating configuration. Benefits afforded by the plug option include: 1. More passenger comfort because of the lower density of passengers and thus passengers having more space. 2. Reduced weight (63 lbs vs 150 lbs for the door configuration) and associated cost savings in operating the airplane. 3. A full-sized passenger window. 4. A structural component that does not have the complexity of a door with its associated parts, operations, and maintenance concerns. The accident airplane was equipped with 178 passenger seats, of which rows 1 through 4 were first class, rows 6 through 9 were premium seats, and rows 10 through 34 were economy class. The MED plugs, with a standard window each, were located at row 26 on the right and left sides of the airplane. Each door plug was about 29 inches wide and 59 inches high. The accident MED plug was manufactured by Spirit AeroSystems Malaysia on March 24, 2023, and was received at Spirit AeroSystems Wichita on May 10, 2023. The MED plug was then installed and rigged on the fuselage (Spirit AeroSystems Fuselage Line 8789) before it was shipped to Boeing on August 20, 2023. The fuselage arrived at Boeingâs Renton, Washington, facility on August 31, 2023. The MED plug is primarily constructed of aluminum and is installed in the fuselage by means of two upper guide fittings and two lower hinge fittings. The two upper guide fittings are located on the upper sides of the plug and engage with two upper guide rollers that are fixed to the upper sides of the fuselage opening. Two lower hinge guide fittings are fixed to the lower section of the plug and engage with the two lower hinge fittings that are attached to the bottom of the fuselage opening at the lower hinge bracket assemblies. Once the plug is in place, it is secured from moving vertically by a total of four bolts. There is a bolt installed through each upper guide fitting and each lower hinge guide fitting. Once these bolts are installed, they are secured using castle nuts and cotter pins. Outboard motion of the plug is prevented by 12 stop fittings (6 along each forward and aft edge) installed on the fuselage door frame structure. The door plug is only intended to be opened for maintenance and inspection, which requires removing the vertical movement arrestor bolts and upper guide track bolts. The strap assemblies below the second stop pad from the top restrict the plug from opening further than 15Â°, suitable for maintenance and inspection purposes. The NTSBâs investigative team conducted a postaccident examination of the aircraft structure, flight deck, cabin interior, cabin safety systems, and pressurization system. The cabin pressurization system maintains a safe, comfortable cabin pressure altitude and, under normal operations, the maximum cabin pressure altitude is around 8,000 ft. A postaccident review of cabin pressure/cabin altitude data before the decompression event showed that the cabin pressure control system had functioned per design with no cabin altitude or cabin rate exceedances. However, the NTSBâs examination of the airplaneâs maintenance logs identified entries indicating that a pressure controller light had illuminated on three previous flights. Pressurization on the 737-9 is managed by a triple-redundant system with two automated pressure controllers and a manual back-up system. An issue with one controller prompts the system to switch to the alternate controller automatically. If both automated pressure controllers fail, a manual back-up system can be used, which is operated by the pilots. Any one of these three systems is fully capable of maintaining safe cabin pressurization. To ensure a complete study of the pressurization system, the NTSB retained the two cabin pressure controllers and the outflow valve for further study. When the rapid decompression occurred, all flight attendant and passenger oxygen masks immediately deployed. Examination revealed that the masksâ associated chemical generators operated as designed and produced oxygen for the airplane occupants. In addition, the examination included cabin communications and lighting systems, emergency equipment, passenger safety information, the flight deck door, aircraft exits, and the condition of the cabin interior to include all seats, seat tracks, windows, doors, and interior paneling. The flight crew reported that the cockpit door had opened during the depressurization event. In a revision to the Flight Crew Operations Manual, issued on January 15, 2024, Boeing confirmed that the door functioned as designed. Damage to the passenger cabin included: damage in seat rows 25ABC and 26ABC as described below, deformation of the doorframe of the forward lavatory, and buckling and displacement of the sidewall panels and trim throughout the airplane. There were no indications of any other failures or malfunction of the airplane or any of its systems. Seat 25A was rotated out and aft approximately 10Â°â20Â° toward the opening. The seatback of Seat 26A was rotated forward and outboard.  The NTSB Structures and Materials specialists, along with representatives from parties to the investigation, examined the MED plug and associated components removed from the accident airplane. The MED plug was mostly intact with some damage from the event and appeared to be manufactured in accordance with the engineering drawings. The two vertical movement arrestor bolts, two upper guide track bolts, forward lower hinge guide fitting, and forward lift assist spring were missing and have not been recovered. Contact damage was noted on the lower sides of the 12 stop pins and fittings on the MED plug. Corresponding contact damage was noted on the 12 stop pads and fittings attached to the fuselage. Overall, the damage was consistent with the MED plug translating upward, outboard, and aft during the separation. Both upper guide fittings installed on the forward and aft sides of the MED plug, respectively, were fractured vertically through the inboard wall of the track. Examination revealed features consistent with overstress fracture and no evidence of pre-existing cracks or damage. The outboard upper guide track bolt holes were intact and exhibited no deformation. The paint in the upper guide track bolt hole bores was intact and showed no evidence of heavy contact damage. There were some light circular witness marks around the hole bores consistent with the presence of a washer at some time. The aft lower hinge guide fitting fractured from the MED plug during the event and remained attached to the aft hinge fitting. The forward lower hinge guide fitting fractured from the MED plug and separated from the forward hinge fitting. The forward hinge fitting shaft was bent inboard about 0.4Â° with corresponding contact damage noted to the MED plug lower beam. The vertical movement arrestor bolt hole bore in the forward hinge fitting was intact and undamaged. The aft hinge fitting was bent inboard about 3.7Â° with corresponding contact damage noted to the MED plug lower beam. Contact damage was noted on the inboard side of the hinge fitting shaft intersecting the vertical movement arrestor bolt hole consistent with contact with the MED plug, but the hole bore was otherwise undamaged. The outboard side of the vertical movement arrestor bolt hole was slightly elongated and exhibited small tensile cracks at the apex of the bend consistent with plastic deformation of the hinge fitting shaft. The hole bore was otherwise undamaged. The attachment flange on the aft lower hinge guide fitting was fractured at the two upper attach hole locations, and the bolts remained installed in the MED plug. The two lower attach bolts were fractured. A similar damage pattern was noted on the MED plug at the forward lower hinge guide fitting attachment location. All features were consistent with ductile overstress fracture. The vertical movement arrestor bolt holes in the aft lower hinge guide fitting were intact and undamaged. Overall, the observed damage patterns and absence of contact damage or deformation around holes associated with the vertical movement arrestor bolts and upper guide track bolts in the upper guide fittings, hinge fittings, and recovered aft lower hinge guide fitting indicate that the four bolts that prevent upward movement of the MED plug were missing before the MED plug moved upward off the stop pads. The Manufacturing Records Group traveled to Boeingâs Renton, Washington, facility to review manufacturing records for the accident airplane specific to the left MED plug area. According to records, the accident fuselage arrived at Boeingâs Renton facility by rail on August 31, 2023. During the manufacturing process, if any defects or discrepancies were found, a Non-Conformance Record (NCR) or a disposition required NCR were generated. On September 1, 2023, records show that NCR 1450292531 was created noting five damaged rivets on the edge frame forward of the left MED plug.  Documents and photos show that to perform the replacement of the damaged rivets, access to the rivets required opening the left MED plug. To open the MED plug, the two vertical movement arrestor bolts and two upper guide track bolts had to be removed. Records show the rivets were replaced per engineering requirements on Non-Conformance (NC) Order 145-8987-RSHK-1296-002NC completed on September 19, 2023, by Spirit AeroSystems personnel. Photo documentation obtained from Boeing shows evidence of theleft-hand MED plug closed with no retention hardware (bolts) in the three visible locations (the aft upper guide track is covered with insulation and cannot be seen in the photo). This image was attached to a text message between Boeing team members on September19, 2023, around 1839 local. These Boeing personnel were discussing interior restoration after the rivet rework was completed during second shift operations that day. The investigation continues to determine what manufacturing documents were used to authorize the opening and closing of the left MED plug during the rivet rework. The Human Performance Investigator joined the group to travel to Spirit AeroSystems, where they reviewed pertinent build work documents and observed a door plug installation. As mentioned earlier, the accident MED plug was manufactured by Spirit AeroSystems Malaysia on March 24, 2023, and received at Spirit AeroSystems Wichita on May 10, 2023. The MED plug was then installed and rigged on the fuselage prior to delivery to Boeing. During the build process, one quality notification (QN NW0002407062) was noted indicating the seal flushness was out of tolerance by 0.01 inches. No manufacturing rework was required, as Spirit AeroSystems Engineering determined the condition was structurally and functionally acceptable and did not adversely affect the form, fit, or function of the installation. There were no other QNs for the left MED plug before leaving Spirit AeroSystems. Fuselage Line 8789 was shipped to Boeing on August 20, 2023.  The group then traveled to AAR, Oklahoma City, where a wi-fi and PCS antenna was installed on the accident airplane from November 27, 2023, to December 7, 2023. The group reviewed applicable installation retrofit documents and received a presentation on AARâs quality assurance and safety management system (SMS) processes. The group also witnessed a wi-fi retrofit in progress. Facility representatives reported that they have modified approximately 60 Alaska Airlines 737-9 airplanes with the wi-fi and PCS antenna installation and have not had to remove or open any MED plugs for this work, to include the event airplane. The manufacturing/human performance group has done a complete records review from the time the event airplane left the Boeing factory to the time of the accident and found no evidence that the left MED plug was opened after leaving Boeingâs facility. Interviews of Boeing and Spirit AeroSystemsâ personnel will be scheduled at a future date. The group will also be looking at Boeingâs SMS and Spirit AeroSystemsâ ongoing development of its voluntary SMS program. The group will also assess the FAAâs involvement in the manufacturersâ development of their respective SMS programs and the level of oversight applied to each.  As a precaution, Alaska Airlines grounded its fleet of B737-9 airplanes to inspect the MED plugs soon after the event. Their inspections began Saturday morning, January 6, 2024. In addition, the FAA issued an emergency airworthiness directive on January 6 requiring all operators of 737-9 airplanes to conduct specific inspections before returning the airplanes to service. On January 21, 2024, the FAA published Safety Alert for Operators (SAFO) 24001 for operators that have the same MED plug as the accident airplane but on a different model of airplane. The SAFO is for Boeing 737-900ER airplanes and recommends that operators inspect, as soon as possible, the four locations where the retaining hardware secures the door to the airframe. Boeing issued multiple multi-operator messages (MOMs). The most recent, MOM 24-0010- 01B(R4) dated January 25, 2024, contains revised instructions for inspecting 737-9 airplanes that have the MED plugs. The NTSBâs investigation is ongoing.

The flight was a regularly scheduled domestic passenger flight from Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport (PHX), Phoenix, Arizona to IAH. The flight crew statements and flight data showed a stable approach to the landing flare. The first officer was pilot flying and stated he began the flare slightly late. Both crewmembers stated the touchdown was firm with a slight ânose-highâ bounce. The flight crew was not aware the airplaneâs tail had impacted the runway until the ground crew at the gate notified them. Flight data showed that the airplane touched down on the runway with a 6.5-degree nose-up attitude and vertical acceleration of 1.87g. The speed brakes deployed two seconds after the initial touchdown. At the same time, the aircraft became airborne again and the nose began to lower. Two seconds later, as the speed brakes retracted, the airplaneâs pitch began to increase, and the airplane touched down a second time with pitch of 7.2 degrees and a vertical acceleration of about 2.87g. The airplane became airborne for a 3rd time for about a second before it touched down for the final time. The nose was lowered to the ground, and speed brakes were extended again. Post-accident assessment of the aircraft revealed substantial damage to the auxiliary power unit (APU) firewall bulkhead that occurred as a result of the aircraftâs aft fuselageâs contact with the runway.  Probable Cause: The airplaneâs aft fuselage impacted the runway as a result of a delayed flare and subsequent nose-high pitch inputs during the aircraftâs multiple touchdowns.METAR: Weather about the incident time (1610Z): KIAH 101553Z 16009KT 10SM FEW150 SCT250 13/01 A2996 RMK AO2 SLP145 T01280011 KIAH 101653Z 18009KT 10SM FEW250 17/03 A2995 RMK AO2 SLP142 T01670028Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA24LA065 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA24LA065  https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=193637  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates20-Jan-2024 19:54 harro Added 08-Feb-2024 19:50 Captain Adam Updated [Time, Damage, Category, Accident report, ]04-May-2024 17:30 ASN Updated [Narrative, ]18-May-2024 19:24 Captain Adam Updated [Time, Total occupants, Location, Source, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

Once clear of clouds and with the runway in sight, the pilot canceled the instrument flight rules clearance, announced their position over the airportâs common traffic advisory frequency and received a reply with a report of 1/4 inch of dry snow covering the runway, unplowed. During the landing roll, they applied brakes, extended spoilers, and thrust reversers. Initially the airplane slowed; however, about halfway down the runway, the airplaneâs antiskid system was functioning continuously, and the airplaneâs rate of deceleration decreased. The pilot was unsure if the thrust reversers deployed, and he cycled the thrust reversers and did not feel any effects. The pilot stated that, in his experience, the airplaneâs thrust reversers do not feel very effective. The pilot considered aborting the landing, started to clean up the airplane but thought it was too late. The airplane overran the departure end of the runway, onto a grass covered area and into a deep ravine, resulting in substantial damage to the fuselage and both wings. The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation. The automated weather observation station located on the airport reported that, about 44 minutes before the accident, the wind was from 090Â° at 12 knots. The same automated station reported that, about 16 minutes after the accident, the wind was from 090Â° at 12 knots. The airplane landed on runway 22. The fixed based operator owner reported that, on the day of the accident, his review of the runway conditions at the airport appeared to be around an inch of snow on the runway surface. Additionally, plowing at the airport so far this year had been âabysmal.â Big windrows and ice chunks have been left; taxiway corners had been built up to the point there could be an occurrence should an airplane be taxiing by. Earlier this year, several departures were delayed due to the runway not being plowed. According to the chairman of the airport board, there is no formal process to conduct runway assessments. However, an airport board member lives in the area and routinely visits the airport to conduct runway assessments. The runway assessments and frequency of the observations are not documented but are conveyed verbally to the airport board via cell phone. To the best of his knowledge, there is no formal snow or ice removal plan. When the runway is required to be cleared, a board member will use county provided equipment to clear the runway. The frequency of the snow removal is not documented. The airport snow removal equipment is limited to clear substance to Â½ inch of the runway surface. On the day of the accident, he was not aware of a Notice to Air Misson (NOTAM) issued for the conditions of the runway environment. According to the airplane manufacturer, the estimated landing distance on a dry runway was about 3,350 ft, with loose snow and no tailwind the estimated landing distance was about 6,700 ft, and on loose snow with tailwind, the estimated landing distance was 7,531 ft. According to the Federal Aviation Administration, the airport is not required to have a snow and ice control plan. However, the airport was provided federal funds (grant) to purchase/acquire a snowplow to maintain the airport surfaces during inclement weather conditions. There may be times where issues arise, and action is delayed. In that case it is expected that a NOTAM be issued as outlined in the grant agreement. Probable Cause: The flight crewâs decision to land on a snow-covered runway with a tailwind, resulting in a runway excursion and subsequent impact with terrain. Contributing to the accident, was the failure of the airport authority to plow the runway.METAR: KLVM 111553Z AUTO 09012KT 10SM OVC019 M17/M19 A2968 RMK AO2 SLP131 T11671194 KLVM 111453Z AUTO 09012KT 10SM OVC019 M16/M19 A2967 RMK AO2 SLP127 60000 T11611189 53012Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: WPR24LA071 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: https://www.krtv.com/news/montana-and-regional-news/small-plane-ends-up-in-a-ravine-at-livingston-airport  https://www.kbzk.com/news/local-news/airplane-crashes-at-livingston-airport-after-missing-runway-passengers-injured  https://www.mclarens.com/auctions/1983-learjet-55-n558ra-s-n-086/  https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=193641  https://www.flightaware.com/live/flight/RAX698/history/20240111/1145Z/KPTK/KLVM  https://www.flightradar24.com/data/flights/rax698#33954ab0  Location  Images: Photos: NTSB Photos: NTSB Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates12-Jan-2024 03:43 Geno Added 12-Jan-2024 07:31 gianniprof Updated [Date, ]12-Jan-2024 07:37 harro Updated [Aircraft type, Registration, Cn, Operator, Other fatalities, Departure airport, Source, Damage, Narrative, ]12-Jan-2024 07:41 harro Updated [Other fatalities, Source, Narrative, ]12-Jan-2024 07:45 harro Updated [Other fatalities, Narrative, Category, ]12-Jan-2024 14:40 Anon.

The commercial pilot was seriously injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135 on-demand cargo flight. According to preliminary information from Federal Aviation Administration air traffic control (ATC), the airplane departed Manchester Boston Regional Airport (MHT), Manchester, New Hampshire, at 0710, destined for Presque Isle International Airport (PQI), Presque Isle, Maine. Immediately after takeoff, the airplane broadcast an emergency transponder code. The airplane then flew erratically for 16 minutes while the ATC controller attempted to establish radio contact, before it collided with wooded terrain about 5 miles south of MHT. A debris path was observed, beginning with a damaged fiber optic line about 75 ft high. The debris path extended on a magnetic course of 140Â° for about 200 ft through wooded terrain. The right aileron was found near the beginning of the debris path, suspended in a tree. The wreckage came to rest upright and oriented south at the end of the debris path. The airplaneâs left side (pilot side) cockpit door/hatch was subsequently located in a residential yard about 10 miles north of the main wreckage. Additionally, the airplane was equipped with a portable ladder for pilot entry, which secured to the fuselage under the cockpit door/hatch and was supposed to be stowed inside the cockpit before takeoff. The portable ladder was found outside and aft of the cockpit, resting against the left engine nacelle. The wreckage was retained for further examination.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA24FA097 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/plane-crash-londonderry-new-hampshire-nh-colonial-drive-beechcraft-99-faa/  NTSB  https://registry.faa.gn53rpov/AircraftInquiry/Search/NNumberResult?nNumberTxt=53RP  https://www.flightaware.com/live/flight/N53RP/history/20240126/1120Z/KMHT/KPQI  https://www.instagram.com/p/C2mp5HyO_GQ/  https://cdn.jetphotos.com/full/6/73675_1520438478.jpg (photo) History of this aircraft Ex N64977 Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  2 February 2012 N53RP UAS Transervices Inc, opf.

The airline transport pilot, commercial co-pilot, and two passengers were not injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14Code of Federal Regulations Part 135 on-demand passenger flight. The left seat pilot, who was the pilot flying (PF), reported that when the flight was about 1 hour 15 minutes from MCO, the pilot monitoring (PM) checked the automated terminal information service which advised that the wind was from 270Â° at 14 knots, gusting to 24 knots. After reviewing the runway configuration at MCO they determined the gust value was beyond limits of the airplane, but they then reviewed the operatorâs crosswind performance limits (CPL) and determined it was acceptable to continue to the planned destination. The PF planned to obtain a wind check on final approach at MCO, and if the wind was out of limits the flight would proceed to Executive Airport (ORL), Orlando, Florida, which had a more favorable runway configuration. The PF and PM briefed the arrival and while approaching MCO they checked the automated weather observing system (AWOS) several times. They noted only one instance of wind gusts reported, and that the AWOS was mostly reporting wind from 270Â° to 280Â° at 13 or 14 knots. The flight continued and was cleared for a visual approach. The PM requested a wind check and the local controller replied 290Â° at 21 knots. The PF recalled their previous review of the CPL and noted the wind was at the 19 to 20 knots crosswind component, but then referenced the wind vector on the primary flight display (PFD) and noted an 18-knot crosswind component. The PF elected to continue the approach to runway 36L as the wind was âwithin limits.â He referenced the wind vector on the PFD a final time as the flight crossed the threshold and noted the crosswind was 17 knots. The flight landed on the runway centerline in the touchdown zone and the PF applied left aileron control input to counter the crosswind and deployed the speedbrake. The airplane began drifting left, which the PF attempted to correct with right rudder input but with no effect. The airplane departed the left side of the runway surface, rolled onto grass, and impacted a runway distance remaining sign. The PF was then able to correct to the right, travel back onto the runway, then taxi off the runway at taxiway E and stop where the airplane was secured and then evacuated. According to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) audio communications from the MCO air traffic control tower local west position, at the initial contact with the local controller about 1620, the flight crew were advised the wind was from 290Â° at 21 knots. At 1622:06, a voice from an unidentified aircraft asked for a wind check on the same frequency, and the controller responded 290Â° at 19 knots ânow gusting two fourâ knots. At 1622:06, the accident airplane was about 1.24 nautical miles from the runway 36L threshold. After the accident the flight crew was asked by the controller if they experienced a flat tire, a flight crew member responded, ânegative, weâre not sure, it could have been a gust, but ah weâre not sure.â The operator reported there was no airplane or airplane systemâs warnings or malfunctions before touchdown. Examination of the airplane by an FAA inspector and a representative of the airplane manufacturer revealed no evidence of any failures or malfunctions of the primary or secondary flight controls. The rudder and aileron trims had been set at the neutral position. According to the airplane manufacturer, the left wing forward spar exhibited cracks and deformation. The airplane was equipped with a cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder which were retained for read-out. The airplane flight manual specified the crosswind limitation as 20 knots.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA24LA100 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: NTSB  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates12-Apr-2024 20:37 Captain Adam Added 11-Oct-2024 11:59 ASN Updated Corrections or additions? ...

The captain and co-pilot were fatally injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 positioning flight. The airplane, which was operated by Vici Aviation, LLC and managed by Clay Lacy Aviation, Inc., arrived at West Star Aviationâs facility at Grand Junction Regional Airport (GJT), Grand Junction, Colorado on December 20, 2023 for routine maintenance. According to preliminary information from the maintenance facility, multiple routine inspections had been completed on the airplane including a requirement to remove the wing leading edges and TKS panels to inspect for cracks and signs of corrosion. After the inspections were completed, the airplane was returned to service on February 6, 2024. The flight crew had planned to fly the airplane from GJT to Gig Harbor, Washington on the day of the accident, during which time they would perform a stall warning and systems check in accordance with the airframe manufacturerâs requirements. These requirements, which were listed in the pilotâs operating manual, included a required altitude above 10,000 ft above ground level, 10,000 ft above clouds and below 18,000 ft mean sea level. In addition, this check flight could only be conducted during day visual meteorological conditions with a good visual horizon, with the autopilot disengaged, an operative stall identification system, the external surfaces free of ice, the ventral tank empty and weather radar on standby. According to preliminary automatic dependent system broadcast (ADS-B) data, the airplane departed GJT at 1037 and entered a climb on a southeast heading. The flight crew asked air traffic control (ATC) for a block of altitude from FL180 to FL200 and ATC approved the request. The airplane circled to the northwest as it continued to climb and subsequently leveled off at 1043:49, near the top of the altitude block. At 1046:47 the flight track data showed the airplane begin a rapid descent in circular pattern that resembled the shape of a corkscrew. The airplane made multiple rotations before the track ceased at 1047:44. The airplane came to rest in flat open terrain about 25 nm northwest of GJT at an elevation of about 4,800 ft mean sea level and oriented on a west heading. The airplaneâs major structures were all accounted for at the accident site. A debris path was traced from the main wreckage to the end of a burn area that was about 200 ft long and 175 ft wide at the widest point, oriented on a magnetic heading of 345Â°. A silhouette of the left wing, fuselage and both engines was located about 10 ft south of the main wreckage. The airplaneâs flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder were both recovered from the accident site. The wreckage has also been retained for further examination.METAR: Weather at the departure airport about the departure (1737Z) and accident time (1747Z): KGJT 071753Z 35008KT 10SM -RA BKN037 OVC055 07/02 A2959 RMK AO2 RAE08B26 SLP994 P0000 60001 T00670017 10083 20044 51013 KGJT 071653Z 17009KT 10SM -RA BKN047 OVC085 07/00 A2957 RMK AO2 RAB37 SLP988 P0001 T00720000Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: WPR24FA083 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: https://www.kkco11news.com/2024/02/07/possible-plane-crash-reported-near-loma/  NTSB  https://globe.adsbexchange.com/?icao=ac7108&lat=39.123&lon=-108.648&zoom=8.4&showTrace=2024-02-07&trackLabels  Location  Media: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates07-Feb-2024 19:53 Captain Adam Added 07-Feb-2024 20:50 nhofmann54 Updated [Registration, Cn, Operator, Phase, Departure airport, Source, Damage, ]07-Feb-2024 20:56 ASN Updated [Time, Phase, Departure airport, Narrative, ]07-Feb-2024 21:00 ASN Updated [Source, ]07-Feb-2024 21:40 Anon.

While taxiing within the Amelia Earhart de-icing pad area, the left winglet of JetBlue Airways flight 777 collided with the right horizontal stabilizer and elevator of JetBlue Airways flight 551. There were no injuries to the 210 passengers and crew on flight 551 or the 154 passengers and crew on flight 777. The flight crew of flight 551 stated that, following a normal preflight and uneventful taxi from the gate to the de-icing pad, they were guided by a 'follow me' vehicle. The flight crew proceeded to follow the vehicle to the D2 parking spot. A yellow painted 'T' inside a black square marked the proper stopping point location for the airplane's nose tires when parked. Nearing the stopping point, the 'follow me' vehicle turned to the right and stopped with its headlights facing toward the back of the airplane. The driver of the 'follow me' vehicle communicated with the flight crew via radio and began a 'countdown' for when the captain should stop the airplane.  Upon the verbal stop command, the captain stopped the airplane and set the parking brake. After the de-ice procedure was complete, the flight crew received instructions to taxi the airplane to runway 9 for departure. Immediately after releasing the airplane's parking brake, the flight crew felt jolts and vibrations and the airplane swayed back and forth. The captain set the parking brake and the first officer (FO) contacted air traffic control (ATC) and was informed they had been struck by another aircraft. In a post-accident statement, the driver of the 'follow me' vehicle indicated that he stopped the airplane (flight 551) at what he thought was the normal stopping point.  He had difficulty seeing the yellow 'T' -bar due to the dark night conditions and the de-icing fluid that was present on the ground. A post-accident inspection found that the airplane was about 35 ft short of the normal stopping point.  The flight crew of flight 777 indicated that after a normal preflight and uneventful taxi from the gate to the de-icing pad they were guided to the D1 spot by a 'follow me' vehicle. The captain stated spacing appeared to be tight and he focused on the yellow taxi line to ensure proper clearance from other airplanes in the area. Shortly thereafter, while taxiing, the flight crew heard a grinding noise and felt a vibration. While still moving forward, they heard another aircraft on the radio frequency ask if something had struck their airplane. The flight crew of flight 777 stopped their airplane and set the parking brake. The captain had difficulty seeing the left winglet due to the dark night conditions but noted that it was intact. In addition, he was unable to see the empennage of flight 551 parked at the D2 location as it was behind them. Flight 551 (N956JT) sustained substantial damage to the left horizontal stabilizer and the left elevator. As a result of this event, Aeromag investigated and produced a February 12, 2024, memo to their BOS-JBU [JetBlue] operations staff discussing an amendment to the Coordinator of Traffic and Movement (CTM) phraseology and aircraft stopping procedures. The memo outlined the updated procedures and phraseology as: â¢	âFollow meâ truck is now required to verbally confirm with the flight crew that the aircraft is correctly stopped on the deicing âTâ-Bar. â¢	JetBlue will add to the Airport Briefing Guide (ABG) that the pilot will not configure the aircraft until confirmation that the aircraft is correctly stopped on the deicing âTâ-Bar. â¢	The âfollow meâ truck is required to check the rear of the aircraft to ensure that it is within the bay and clear of the zipper line before confirming brake set.  â¢	Safety Lead will perform a secondary check, reconfirming with the CTM that the aircraft has stopped on the deicing âTâ-Bar. Safety Lead will also verify that the rear of the aircraft is clear of the zipper line and within the bay.  â¢	Truck positioning and aircraft deicing will commence after these checks have been completed. Additionally, once CTM has confirmed with the flight crew that they have a visual on the âfollow meâ truck, the âfollow meâ truck operator will follow these steps: 1. Guide the aircraft into the assigned bay.  2. Ensure the aircraft is properly stopped on the deicing âTâ-Bar.  3. Confirm that the rear of the aircraft is within the bay, clear of the zipper line, before bringing any other aircraft in. Finally, the Safety Lead will:  1. Inspect and confirm with CTM that the aircraft is properly stopped on the deicing âTâ-Bar.  2. Inspect that the rear of the aircraft is well within the bay and clear of the zipper line. Aeromag also increased its daily roster to include sufficient qualified staff to allocate a Safety Lead dedicated to each operational bay regardless of operating conditions. Long term prevention strategies identified were: â¢	Repainting and reviewing the color format of the delineated markings using high-visibility paint and/or reflective inset markers. â¢	Investigating the feasibility of adding high mast lighting for the Earhart facility. â¢	Operational audits to focus on the correct positioning of aircraft while maintaining the safety buffer zones. â¢	Explore opportunities to locate Aeromag tower personnel in elevated positions.

The two pilots were fatally injured. The cabin attendant and the two passengers sustained minor injuries, and one person on the ground suffered minor injury.  The airplane was returning to Naples Municipal Airport (APF), Naples, Florida, from Ohio State University Airport (OSU), Columbus, Ohio, where it had flown earlier in the day. The airplane was serviced with 350 gallons of fuel before departure from OSU. The flight crew contacted the ATC tower at APF while on a right downwind leg of the approach to the airport and maneuvering for a 5-mile final approach to runway 23. At 15:08, the tower controller cleared the flight to land. The airplane was about 6.5 miles north of APF as it turned for the base leg of the traffic pattern. A preliminary review by the NTSB of the FDR data revealed that the first of three Master Warnings was recorded at 1509:33 (L ENGINE OIL PRESSURE), the second immediately following at 1509:34 (R ENGINE OIL PRESSURE), and at 1509:40 (ENGINE). The system alerted pilots with illumination of a âMaster Warningâ light on the glareshield, a corresponding red message on the crew alerting system page and a triple chime voice advisory (âEngine oilâ). Twenty seconds later, at 1510:05, about 1,000 ft msl and 122 kts, on a shallow intercept angle for the final approach course, the crew announced, ââ¦lost both enginesâ¦ emergencyâ¦ making an emergency landingâ. The tower controller acknowledged the call and cleared the airplane to land. At 1510:12, about 900 ft and 115 knots, the crew replied, âWe are cleared to land but we are not going to make the runwayâ¦ ahâ¦ we have lost both engines.â There were no further transmissions from the flight crew. The aircraft descended towards Interstate 75 and touched down aligned with traffic travelling the southbound lanes. The left main landing gear touched down first in the center of the three lanes, and then the right main landing gear touched down in the right lane. The airplane continued through the break-down lane and into the grass shoulder area before impacting a concrete sound barrier. After the airplane came to rest, the cabin attendant stated that she identified that the cabin and emergency exits were blocked by fire and coordinated the successful egress of her passengers and herself through the baggage compartment door in the tail section of the airplane. An inspection of the engine, fuel system and oil filters revealed no immediate anomalies. The MFCs and main fuel pumps from both engines, the fuel injectors from both engines, and all collected fuel samples were retained by the NTSB for further examination. Both engines were also retained for additional examination.METAR: Weather about the accident time (2010Z) KAPF 092053Z 18009KT 10SM BKN050 26/14 A3012 RMK AO2 SLP199 T02560139 56018 KAPF 091953Z 22010KT 10SM SCT050 24/14 A3013 RMK AO2 SLP202 T02440144Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA24FA110 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: https://winknews.com/2024/02/09/plane-crash-i-75-collier-county/  https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/09/us/plane-crash-florida-highway-naples.html  https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/02/09/plane-crash-i-75-naples-florida/72542835007/  NTSB  https://registry.faa.gov/AircraftInquiry/Search/NNumberResult?nNumberTxt=823KD  https://www.flightaware.com/live/flight/HPJ823/history/20240209/1730Z/KOSU/KAPF  https://archive.liveatc.net/kapf/KAPF1-Tower-Feb-09-2024-2000Z.mp3   https://cdn.jetphotos.com/full/5/707837_1706244336.jpg (photo)  https://www.hopajetworldwide.com/aircraft/n823kd/ History of this aircraft Ex (N316KD), N823KD, N828KD, C-FAWU, C-GLXM Location  Media: BREAKING: We're learning more about a plane crash in Naples on I-75. pic.twitter.com/3slB22MMgLâ ABC7 Sarasota (@mysuncoast) February 9, 2024 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates09-Feb-2024 20:32 ASN Added 09-Feb-2024 20:33 ASN Updated [Embed code, Damage, Category, ]09-Feb-2024 20:37 ASN Updated [Aircraft type, Source, Embed code, Narrative, ]09-Feb-2024 20:40 ASN Updated [Aircraft type, Registration, Cn, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, ]09-Feb-2024 20:42 ASN Updated [Time, Operator, Phase, Narrative, ]09-Feb-2024 20:47 ASN Updated [Narrative, ]09-Feb-2024 20:52 ASN Updated [Source, Embed code, ]09-Feb-2024 21:02 ASN Updated [Location, Embed code, Narrative, Category, ]09-Feb-2024 21:04 ASN Updated 09-Feb-2024 22:14 nhofmann54 Updated [Total fatalities, Total occupants, Other fatalities, Source, ]10-Feb-2024 07:35 Vice Captain Edmond Updated [Nature, Narrative, ]10-Feb-2024 07:37 ASN Updated [Narrative, ]10-Feb-2024 09:05 RobertMB Updated [Time, Aircraft type, Operator, Location, Nature, Source, Narrative, ]10-Feb-2024 10:14 Captain Adam Updated [Source, Narrative, ]10-Feb-2024 15:42 Iceman 29 Updated [Embed code, ]11-Feb-2024 10:11 Anon.

The flight crew performed a go-around and proceeded for a landing on runway 26R, 18 minutes later.  The aircraft operated on a flight from Tel Aviv (TLV) with the captain being Pilot Monitoring (PM) and the first officer being Pilot Flying (PF). At 17:22, the pilots performed the approach briefing. At 17:47, the airplane captured the localizer and the pilots received the clearance for an ILS approach 26L. Two minutes later the PM reported âlocalizer establishedâ. The approach was flown manually and the engine thrust levers were controlled manually. During the approach, the landing checklist was completed and at 17:53:20, at 1,000 ft, the co-pilot, as Pilot Flying (PF), determined the approach as stabilised. The PM confirmed it and the approach was continued. As the runway was reached, the PF initiated the flare of the airplane and attempted to align it with the runway from a crosswind approach. At 17:54:31, the airplane touched down for the first time. It lifted off again, rolled right and at 17:54:34, touched down again. At 17:54:37, both pilots almost simultaneously said âgo-aroundâ and the captain intervened in the steering.  During the second bounce the nose was pitched up and at the same time the ground spoilers extended. The combination of both caused the nose to pitch up to +13.7 degrees and the tail strike occurred. The captain then performed the go-around and acted as PF until the landing at 18:12.

Of the 280 passengers and crew, two flight attendants received serious injuries and one received a minor injury. The flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 as a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), Los Angeles, California to EWR. The first officer (FO) was the pilot flying and the captain was the pilot monitoring. The flight crew stated that the departure from LAX was uneventful and the flight leveled off at a cruise altitude of FL350. The FO stated that he was responsible for briefing the approach/arrival into EWR and in preparation for the brief, checked for potential turbulence using the Weather Services International (WSI) application (APP) and used the Skypath APP to see if there were any reports of turbulence. Neither application revealed any significant indications of turbulence along their route. After the brief, the captain turned the onboard weather radar ON for the eventual descent into EWR. The FO stated that while descending through about FL270, the captain announced via the passenger address (PA) system for the flight attendants (FA) to prepare the cabin for landing. Following the announcement, the captain turned the seatbelt sign ON. The FO stated that he observed an overcast layer of clouds ahead and below that the flight would penetrate on their descent to EWR. However, there was no indication of potential turbulence as nothing showed on the aircraft's weather radar or the Skypath APP. Additionally, there were no reports of turbulence from ATC or dispatch. The pilots reported that while descending through about FL210 in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), the flight encountered moderate turbulence lasting a few seconds that caused unsecured items on the flightdeck to be thrown about. After the event, the captain immediately called the cabin crew and was informed of multiple injuries with one flight attendant sustaining a head laceration. Upon being notified of the injuries, the flight crew declared a medical emergency and requested paramedics meet the aircraft at the gate in EWR. Post-flight, two FAâs were diagnosed with fracture injuries and a third was diagnosed with a sub-cranial bleed. Postaccident examination of the weather in the area revealed a frontal boundary moving eastward across New York state. In addition, an upper-level jet stream maximum was located above the accident site. Satellite and weather radar imagery, along with lightning and surface data depicted strong cells in the vicinity of the flight. The U.S National Weather Service (NWS) had issued current Significant Meteorological (SIGMET) warning for embedded thunderstorms with tops reaching FL280 over the region. NTSB group chairs in the areas of air traffic control, operations, meteorology, survival factors, and flight data recorder were assigned.Qualified parties were invited to participate in the investigation. These included the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), United Airlines, The Boeing Company, Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), and the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA). Certified ADS-B data and audio recordings were provided to the NTSB by the FAA. The NTSB is currently analyzing this data. At the time of the accident, flight 1890 was being controlled by air traffic control located at the Boston Air Route Traffic Control Center (ZBW ARTCC). During the week of March 4th, 2024, the ATC group and meteorology specialist traveled to Nashua, New Hampshire to interview personnel at the control center. Data from the digital flight data recorder (DFDR) and the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) were sent to the NTSBâs Vehicle Recorder Laboratory in Washington, DC, for analysis. The investigation continues.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA24LA097 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: FAA  https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/n788ua#33f25f48 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  30 September 2024 N788UA United Airlines 0 148 nm NW of Calgary, AB non Fumes/smoke/odor event Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates12-Feb-2024 20:43 ASN Added 13-Feb-2024 07:31 ASN Updated [Time, Location, Narrative, ]16-Feb-2024 12:29 harro Updated [Other fatalities, ]12-Mar-2024 20:14 Captain Adam Updated [Time, Location, Narrative, Category, Accident report, ]01-Apr-2024 09:10 ASN Updated Corrections or additions? ...

There were no injuries. During the flight preparation, the crew planned to take off from runway 30L, intersection D6. The Take-Off Run Available (TORA) distance at D6 is 2349 meters. The  flight parameter calculations for this intersection were double-checked by the crew. The crew then received instructions from ATC to taxi to position D6 for runway 30L via taxiways F, G, and A, which the crew correctly read back.  At 16:35 UTC, the crew informed the ATC unit that they were approaching intersection D6: ""Air Serbia 86C, approaching  D6, ready."" The controller responded by instructing the flight to hold short, followed by a clearance to line up and wait via D6. At 16:36 UTC, ATC urgently contacted the crew, inquiring if they were aware they were at intersection D5 instead of D6. The crew quickly responded, thanking for the information. ATC immediately contacted the crew again, informing them that the available takeoff length from the given intersection was 1,273 meters, suggesting it was insufficient for a safe takeoff.  The crew requested a minute to perform checks. According to the crew's statement, they then performed flight parameter calculations using the copilot's tablet. During this time, ATC instructed the crew to perform necessary calculations and to contact them, with the option to backtrack to D6 if needed.  Thirty seconds later, the crew contacted the ATC, confirming they were ready for takeoff. ATC acknowledged, asking if they could take off from position/intersection D5, which the crew immediately confirmed. ATC then cleared the flight to take off from runway 30L from position D5, informing them of no wind.  At 16:38 UTC, the aircraft began its takeoff roll.  During the takeoff roll the flight crew made engine thrust changes to achieve a higher speed. At 80 knots, the crew stated everything was normal, but at 100 knots, they noticed insufficient runway length. Considering the available runway length and the aircraft's speed, the crew decided it was safer to continue the takeoff, estimating the aircraft would soon become airborne. They set the engine thrust to maximum and decided to delay rotating the nose of the aircraft to utilize the maximum available runway length and asphalt area beyond the runway. Shortly after leaving the runway and asphalt area, according to the flight crew's statement, the aircraft began to shake, followed by a sound of impact against an object. The plane quickly became airborne, during which the crew continuously heard an unfamiliar noise from the aircraft's body, with interruptions in the operation of the left wing lights. Upon receiving information about issues with several systems, including flaps and engine bleed air, the crew followed the indicated checklist procedures for troubleshooting. Shortly after takeoff, ATC contacted the crew, inquiring about the deviation from the approved flight vector during takeoff. The crew replied that they were unsure but would likely need to return to the airport. Soon after, the crew informed ATC that they needed to return because they had hit something on the ground during takeoff. A little later, they declared a mayday. ATC suggested the crew check the landing gear, with the possibility of a low pass by the control tower. The crew requested time for additional checks, performing two circuits southeast of the airport. According to the crew's statements, they checked the aircraft using checklists to locate the problem. Meanwhile, ATC prepared for the emergency landing. The aircraft then performed a low pass over the runway heading 300 with the landing gear extended, with no issues identified by ATC regarding the landing gear. During descent and flight, the crew reported problems with the flaps and increased aircraft vibrations. After the flyby, the crew decided to land, proceeding with a left turn into the airport circuit, followed by landing on the left runway, runway 30L, at 17:36 UTC. According to the crew's statement, they opted for a slightly higher landing speed due to problems with the flaps, but within prescribed limits, experiencing only vibrations as an issue. After landing, the crew had no further problems with the aircraft and, following communication with ATC, agreed to park at parking position C2. Upon stopping, the crew received information from ground personnel that fuel was leaking from the left wing, quickly shutting down the engines and other systems. During the inspection, significant damage to the aircraft's fuselage was discovered, including multiple punctures on the left side, damage to the root of the left wing with aerodynamic fairing damage at the fuselage-wing junction, punctures in the aircraft's fairing, and damage to the aircraft systems below the fairing, damage to the leading edge of the wing adjacent to the fuselage. During the inspection of airport surfaces in the direction of the aircraft's takeoff from RWY30L, damage to the approach lights for RWY12R was found - the extreme right lights in all three rows (or extreme left in the direction of the aircraft's takeoff) with damage to the control boxes located in the middle of the lights. During rotation, the left wing root hit the support for the Instrument Landing System (ILS) monitor antenna. The antenna broke off, the larger part of which remained embedded in the aircraft. PROBABLE CAUSE (preliminary, the investigation is ongoing): One of the likely causes of this accident is the inadequate assessment of parameters for takeoff during pre-flight preparation by the flight crew of the aircraft, following the decision to take off from a shorter length of the runway in relation to the initially planned one.METAR: METARs about the incident time (1638Z): LYBE 181700Z 02002KT CAVOK 10/04 Q1030 NOSIG= LYBE 181630Z 33002KT CAVOK 10/04 Q1030 NOSIG=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CINS Report number: 01-24 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/oy-gdc#340bbf81  https://globe.adsbexchange.com/?icao=459c83&lat=44.824&lon=20.291&zoom=16.3&showTrace=2024-02-18&trackLabels  https://www.exyuaviation.com/2024/02/marathon-e195-operating-for-air-serbia.html History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  16 October 2017 G-FBEM Flybe 0 near Dublin Airport (EIDW) non Fumes/smoke/odor event Location  Images: Media:??Runway excursion Accident Embraer ERJ-195LR OY-GDC.

The flight was a local maintenance test flight. The purpose of the test flight was to validate maintenance conducted after a write-up for abnormal flight deck noises that occurred on a previous flight.  According to the flight crew, they conducted a flaps 5, reduced power takeoff from runway 28R. The captain recalled the aircraft accelerated faster than normal and had the propensity to lift off prior to the rotation speed of 127 knots. At rotation speed, the captain began a normal aft pull on the control yoke and the pitch attitude increased faster than expected. The captain just called âpositive rate' when the crew heard and felt a âboom.' As this flight was a test flight, it was not loaded with passengers and cargo to a takeoff weight typical of flights the pilot flying normally flew. The pilot flying rotated at a rate ânormal' to his experience, however because the accident aircraft was loaded lighter than normal, the normal rotation inputs resulted in an over-rotation.    The crew assessed the instruments and controllability and decided to continue their climb to flight level (FL) 190 [19,000 feet] where they conducted the tailstrike checklist. They returned to SFO and conducted a flaps 30 landing with no further incident. Prior to leaving the flight deck after the flight, the first officer received the pitch report for takeoff which showed that tail contact occurred about 12.2 degrees during departure and the actual pitch for this departure reached 15.3 degrees.  Inspection of the aircraft showed that the tail strike damaged the chord, web, and stiffeners of the auxiliary power unit firewall bulkhead. Because the damage would adversely affect the structural strength of the bulkhead and require major repair or replacement, the damage was considered substantial. The investigation determined that the maintenance conducted prior to this test flight was not related to the accident. The aircraft was repaired and resumed regular service on 23 March 2024. Probable Cause: The crew's over-rotation of the aircraft pitch during takeoff which resulted in a tailstrike.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA24LA110 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA24LA110  https://www.flightaware.com/live/flight/N13138/history/20240226/0210Z/KSFO/KSFO History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  16 November 2021 N13138 United Airlines 0 Boston-Logan International Airport, MA (BOS/KBOS) min APU failure 9 February 2023 N13138 United Airlines 0 N of Tampa, FL non Turbulence Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates18-May-2024 18:22 Captain Adam Added 18-May-2024 19:08 ASN Updated [Location, Phase, Source, Narrative, ]20-Jul-2024 07:27 ASN Update Bot Updated [Time, Cn, Operator, Other fatalities, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, ]20-Jul-2024 08:04 ASN Updated [Source, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The Cessna crashed in Nairobi National Park, killing both occupants, and was destroyed. The Dash 8 safely returned to Wilson Airport. All 39 passengers and five crew on board were not injured. The aircraft sustained damage to the leading edge of the right-hand horizontal stabilizer. The Cessna operated on a training flight and was performing touch-and-goes on runway 07. The Safarilink Dash 8 was cleared for takeoff by the tower controller and the crew was told to look out for traffic upwind runway 07 (5Y-NNJ). The upwind traffic was also advised to look out for the DHC-8 departing runway 14.  According to the crew, while climbing through 400 ft, the captain had visual traffic to his 8 oâclock position which he described as being well clear of conflict. At approximately 6,000ft, the crew heard a loud bang and felt an impact. The PIC felt an imbalance (a yaw) and immediately tried to recover stability of the aircraft. The PIC stopped climbing and leveled off at 6,200ft.  The flight then returned to WIL after reported a possible collision with another aircraft.

The left main landing gear (MLG) departed the paved surface and contacted a concrete structure that was recessed into the ground, resulting in its separation.  The 6 crew and 160 passengers were deplaned via airstairs.  No injuries were reported.  The flight was a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 scheduled domestic passenger flight from Memphis International Airport (MEM), Memphis, Tennessee to IAH.  In response to the accident, the NTSB traveled to Houston. As part of the investigative process, the NTSB invited qualified parties to participate in the investigation. These included the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), United Airlines, The Boeing Company, and the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA). The parties were formed into specialized investigative groups led by NTSB group chairs in the areas of Operations, Human Performance, Systems, Structures, Digital Flight Data Recorder (DVDR) and Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR). History of Flight According to the flight crew, the captain was the pilot flying and the first officer (FO) was the pilot monitoring. The captain said he observed the reported runway surface condition codes when checking the automatic terminal information system (ATIS) via his electronic flight bag (EFB). For runway 26L and 26R, he recalled seeing codes of 3/3/3 and for runway 27 codes of 5/5/5. The actual runway surface condition codes being broadcasted on the ATIS for runway 27 at the time were 3/3/3 which according to the runway condition assessment matrix (RCAM) indicated the runway was slippery when wet and âbraking deceleration is noticeably reduced for the wheel braking effort applied or directional control is noticeably reduced.â When the crew checked in with Houston Approach Control, they were told to expect a landing on runway 26L. The captain asked the FO to request a landing on runway 27 instead. The FO made, and the controller approved the request and issued instructions for the instrument landing system (ILS) approach to runway 27. After checking in with Houston Tower (about 12,000 feet msl according to the FO), the captain asked the FO to request approval to roll to the end of runway 27. The FO made the request. A tower controller approved it and instructed them, âkeep your speed upâ. The captain changed the autobrake setting from 2 to 1 (which would command a reduced deceleration rate). The approach was conducted in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) and, according to the crew, the airplane broke out of the clouds between 800 and 1,000 feet msl. They reported that visibility under the clouds was good, and the captain recalled that the runway appeared dry. The FO recalled that the runway appeared wet. The crew stated that the touchdown was uneventful, at an appropriate speed, and within the touchdown zone. The speed brakes extended normally, and the thrust reversers were deployed to idle reverse thrust. The captain said that, shortly after touchdown, he retracted the speedbrakes by the action of moving the speedbrake lever to its down and locked position, which disabled the autobrakes. He did not âslow too much initiallyâ because the runway appeared dry, he wanted to expedite their time on the runway, and because he preferred decelerating gradually for passenger comfort.  The captain said he applied the brakes manually using the toe brakes at about 6,000 feet from the end of the runway but felt as if the deceleration was less than normal. DFDR data and automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) data indicated that after the disabling of the autobrakes occurred, manual braking did not begin until the airplane was about 4,000 feet from the end of the runway. The captain recalled hearing the runway awareness and advisory system (RAAS) alert indicating 1,000 ft of runway distance remaining. He became concerned and began applying more pressure to the brakes. As he approached the end of the runway, he elected to attempt to turn onto taxiway SC, by utilizing the steering tiller and rudder pedals while pushing aggressively on the brake pedals. During the turn onto the taxiway, he felt the fuselage and rudder/brake pedals begin to shake violently. He briefly released the brake pressure and the shaking ceased. He then reapplied aggressive brake pressure and the shaking resumed. The airplane slid off the runway and the left MLG tires and nose wheels tires entered the grass before the airplane came to a rest with its left wing low. A postaccident examination of the accident site revealed that the left MLG tires had impacted a large concrete âmanholeâ designed as an electrical junction box for lights/utilities at the airport. As a result of the impact, the left MLG separated from the airplane at the fuse pins near the rear spar as designed to prevent more severe damage to surrounding structures. The airplane came to rest on the left engine nacelle, left winglet, and aft fuselage and sustained substantial damage to the left wing and aft fuselage. Flight Crew The captain was 61 years old and held an airline transport pilot (ATP) certificate with a rating for multiengine-land, commercial privileges for airplane single engine land, and type ratings on the B-727, B-737, B-757, B-767 which included the limitation English Proficient. He held an FAA first-class medical certificate dated October 4, 2023, with the limitation of must use corrective lenses to meet vision standards at all required distances. The captain was hired by United Airlines on April 29, 1987, and had accumulated about 15,191 hours in B-737 aircraft with about 9,607 of those hours as pilot-in-command. The FO was 38 years old and held an ATP certificate with a rating for multi-engine land, commercial privileges for airplane single engine land, and type ratings in the B-737, and L-188 which included the limitation of B-737 Circling approach VMC Only, and English Proficient. He held an FAA first-class medical certificate dated June 8, 2023. The FO was hired by United Airlines on October 1, 2019, and had accumulated about 1,252 hours in B-737 aircraft. Weather Conditions and Flight Crew Procedures A Meteorological Aerodrome Report (METAR) at IAH was reporting at 0753 CST, wind from 190Â° at 5 knots, tower visibility 1 Â½ mile in mist, ceiling broken at 800 ft agl, overcast at 1,800 ft, temperature 23Â°C (73Â°F), dew point temperature 22Â°C (71Â°F), altimeter 29.71 inches of mercury. Remarks: automated observation system with a precipitation discriminator, surface visibility 2 Â½ miles, sea level pressure 1005.9-hPa, temperature 22.8Â°C, dew point 21.7Â°C. Photos and surveillance video during and immediately following the accident indicated wet runway and taxiway surface conditions. United Airlines supplementary flight crew procedures required for âLanding on Wet or Slippery Runwayâ stated in part: ??? ??????? ??????? ?????? ?? ???? ?? ???????? ????? ???? ????? ?????????. ?????? ????????? ??? ???? ????????? ?? ???? ?????. ?? ??? ???? ??? ??? ???? ????? ?? ?????????. ????????? ???????? ????????? ??? ???????? ???????? ?? ??? ??????? ?????? ???? ????? ??? ?????? ?? ????????? ??????? ?? 3 ?? ???, ?? ???????????. ?? ??? ????? ??????, ????????? ?????? ?????????? ?? ??????? ?????? ?????????, ?? ???????????? ??? ??? ??? ??????????. Data Data from the DFDR was sent to the NTSBâs Vehicle Recorder Laboratory in Washington, DC, for analysis. Data showed that at touchdown the speed brake lever position [Speed Brake Lever Pos] and auto brake parameters were full up and on for about 5 seconds before transitioning to down and locked and off for the remainder of the landing rollout. The engine thrust reversers were deployed for the left and right engines for about 27 and 26 seconds respectively at idle reverse. The left and right brake pressure increased to their maximum pressure consistent with aggressive manual braking before and as the airplaneâs heading changed consistent with a right turn. The CVR was removed from the airplane and sent to the NTSBâs Vehicle Recorder Laboratory in Washington, DC, for analysis. Certified ADS-B data, which records more accurate latitude and longitude data than the DFDR, was provided to the NTSB by the FAA. Analysis of the ADS-B and DFDR data shows that the airplane touched down about 1,000 feet from the runway threshold with a groundspeed of about 158 knots. With about 1,000 ft and 500 ft of runway remaining the airplane groundspeeds were about 72 kts and 57 kts respectively. The right turn to exit the runway was initiated at about 39 kts groundspeed and the aircraft departed the end of the paved surface at about 22 kts.METAR: weather about the incident time (1358Z): KIAH 081453Z 16005KT 1 1/2SM BR BKN008 OVC020 23/22 A2972 RMK AO2 SLP063 60002 T02280222 51014 KIAH 081353Z 19005KT 1 1/2SM BR BKN008 OVC018 23/22 A2971 RMK AO2 SFC VIS 2 1/2 SLP059 T02280217Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA24FA120 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: https://www.click2houston.com/news/local/2024/03/08/plane-goes-off-runway-at-bush-airport-no-injuries-reported/  https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/n27290#344859ac  Location  Media:So this happened todayâ¦#UnitedAirlines #imsafe #Houston #IAH #flying #plane #Memphisflight pic.twitter.com/gLKBsXnDTQâ Vicki.O (@VickiO_theDO) March 8, 2024 â¦@flightradar24â© UAL2477 (?) off the runway at IAH pic.twitter.com/d2w5g1D8Kbâ Ren Ganner (@RenGanner) March 8, 2024 Up close photos of @United Flight 2477 (Boeing 737 MAX 8) that left the runway and came to a stop in grass at George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH) in Houston. @KPRC2 has learned no one was injured. ?

The flight was a regularly scheduled passenger flight from Northwest Florida Beaches International Airport (ECP), Panama City, Florida to BWI. As a result of the turbulence, one flight attendant sustained serious injuries. The airplane was not damaged, and the flight continued to BWI without further incident.  The flight deck crew reported that they were aware of, and had received, pilot reports of turbulence at lower altitudes on arrival into BWI. They had coordinated with the cabin crew during their preflight briefing about securing the cabin early and reiterated this again (as well as asking them to take their seats afterward) just prior to starting a standard terminal arrival (the RAVNN SIX) into BWI. As they began the arrival, they learned of a pilot report of severe turbulence at flight level (FL) 250 from an airplane on arrival into nearby Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA), Arlington, Virginia.  While the cabin crew were securing the cabin and galleys, the airplane encountered severe turbulence as it descended through FL270. The captain immediately made a public address announcement to the cabin for the flight attendants to take their seats. Flight attendants B and C were âtossed aroundâ¦.sent into the airâ before landing on the floor of the aft galley. Flight attendant C sustained a hairline fracture to the left arm. A non-revenue Southwest Airlines flight attendant who was seated in the rear of the airplane rendered assistance to flight attendant C.  The captain declared a medical emergency and received an expedited approach into BWI. The first officer coordinated with airline operations and arranged for medical personnel to meet the airplane at the gate. A post-accident review of weather records revealed that there were four pilot reports of moderate to severe turbulence from FL160 to FL250 in an area to the southwest of the accident location. A high-resolution rapid refresh numerical model computed for the time and location of the accident revealed that conditions were conducive for moderate clear air turbulence from FL250 to FL280. Infrared and visible satellite imagery depicted a transverse wave cloud pattern (often observed in turbulent conditions) over the accident area. The cloud temperatures were consistent with cloud tops near 33,000 ft above mean sea level.  A graphical Airmenâs Meteorological (G-AIRMET) information Tango (turbulence), issued by the National Weather Service, valid at the time of the accident advised of occasional moderate turbulence between FL180 and FL380 for much of the mid-Atlantic and northeast states. Graphic turbulence guidance products predicted areas of moderate turbulence over central Virginia moving northwest between 1300 and 1400 eastern standard time, at FL240.

The airline transport pilot, commercial pilot, and three passengers were fatally injured. The airplane was operated by SkyJet Elite under the provisions of Title 1 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 as a personal flight. According to a representative of the operator, the flight crew itinerary for the day was for the pilots to fly from Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International Airport (FLL), Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to HSP. The passengers planned to attend a conference in Hot Springs, while the flight crew were scheduled to continue to Teterboro Airport (TEB), Teterboro, New Jersey. According to the operatorâs trip itinerary, both flights were non-revenue 14 CFR Part 91 flights. According to preliminary Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) air traffic control audio recordings and automatic dependent surveillance - broadcast (ADS-B) flight track data, the flight departed FLL about 1246 and proceeded on course to HSP. About 1430, the flight crew checked in with Washington Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC). At that time, the airplane was about 60 miles south of HSP, at flight level 210 (21,000 ft). The controller instructed the flight crew to advise when they had the current weather and NOTAM information at HSP, and to advise of which instrument approach they wanted to utilize. The flight crew acknowledged the instruction. About 1432, the controller queried the flight crew again about which approach they wanted to conduct at HSP, and if they had the current weather and NOTAMs at the airport. The flight crew responded that they had received the weather conditions at HSP airport, but the information was about an hour old, and they further advised they wanted to fly the ILS approach to runway 25. The controller subsequently cleared the flight to AHLER intersection, which was an initial fix for the ILS approach to runway 25, located about 10 miles northeast of the airport. About 1433 to 1439, the controller provided 5Â° to 10Â° right of course headings as the flight continued to AHLER intersection. The controller also instructed the flight crew to confirm they had the current weather and NOTAMs at HSP. About 1441, the flight crew advised they had the current weather and NOTAMs. About 1444, the flight crew requested to descend from 7,000 ft mean sea level (msl) to 6,000 ft msl. The controller responded by clearing the flight direct to AHLER intersection for the ILS runway 25 approach and to cross AHLER at or above 6,100 ft msl. The flight crew read back the clearance and requested radar vectors for the approach, but subsequently followed up that they were proceeding direct to AHLER and cleared for the approach. About 1447, the flight crew advised that they would cancel their IFR (instrument flight rules) flight plan once on the ground at HSP with the flight service station. The controller advised that they could still contact the controller while on the ground, and they could cancel the flight plan directly with him. Subsequently, the controller advised that there was no traffic observed between their position and the airport and to switch to the common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF). The flight crew readback the instruction and no further radio communications were recorded between the controller and the flight crew. According to an HSP airport staff member who was monitoring the CTAF, shortly before the accident he heard two radio calls from an airplane announcing that they were conducting an approach to land on runway 25. Shortly thereafter, he heard the airplaneâs impact with terrain and turned to see smoke rising from the approach end of runway 25. The airplaneâs ADS-B flight track revealed that the airplane proceeded about 15 miles northeast of the airport to conduct the ILS approach to runway 25, commencing the approach at the AHLER intersection. The airplaneâs altitude descended along the final approach course to runway 25. The final recorded ADS-B position was about 200 ft from the initial impact point with terrain. The wreckage debris path was oriented on a 250Â° to 255Â° magnetic heading and spanned about 150 ft from the initial impact point to the main wreckage. The initial impact point coincided with several trees that were located along a down sloping ravine about 300 ft from the runway threshold. The wreckage was heavily fragmented and was thermally damaged during a postimpact fire. All primary flight control surfaces and major portions of the airplane were located at the accident site. The right main landing gear was the only major portion of the airplane to have been located next to runway 25; it was located about 315 ft forward of the fuselage and about 10 ft to the right of the runway edge. Flight control continuity could not be established from the cockpit to the flight controls due to the extensive impact damage, however; continuity was observed at the flight control surfaces that remained partially intact. The configuration of the airplane at the time of impact was assessed to be landing gear down and flaps set to 40Â° as measured by actuator and jackscrew positions. The left wing outboard spoiler was observed retracted and its actuator position corresponded to a retracted position. The right wing spoilers were not identifiable due to the impact and thermal damage. The impact and thermal damage sustained to the cockpit prevented any data collection of instrument readings or switch positions. Both engines were located in the debris field with heavy impact and thermal damage observed. The left engine had separated into two pieces and the right engine remained mostly intact. Both engine spinners exhibited varying degrees of rotational scoring signatures. Both engine fan blade sections exhibited leading edge tearing, gouging, and battering damage, and several fan blades were observed to be bent opposite the direction of engine rotation. Review of the Aviation Routine Weather Reports (METARs) at the airport found two reports issued, with one issued about 20 minutes before the accident and another report issued a few minutes after the accident. At 1435, the wind was 270Â° at 21 knots, gusting to 31 knots, visibility was 10 statute miles, and no ceiling was reported. At 1455, the wind was 280Â° at 19 knots, gusting to 38 knots, visibility was 10 statute miles, and scattered clouds were reported 2,000 ft above ground level (agl), broken clouds 2,400 ft agl, and an overcast ceiling at 4,500 ft agl. According to FAA airman and operator records, the pilot in command (PIC) held an airline transport pilot certificate and held a PIC type rating in the accident airplane that was issued on January 28, 2024. The PIC was issued a first-class medical certificate on December 19, 2023, the application for which reported 13,655 total flight hours. According to an operatorâs electronic pilot logbook, a total of 65 hours, of which 55 hours were PIC hours, had been logged in the accident airplane make and model. The PIC also held the position of Chief Pilot for the operator. The second in command (SIC) held a commercial pilot certificate, with airplane single, multiengine land, and instrument airplane ratings. The SIC was issued a first-class medical certificate on April 4, 2023. He was issued a SIC type rating in the accident airplane on November 20, 2023. According to an operatorâs electronic pilot logbook, he had logged a total of 1,068 flight hours, of which 136 hours were in the accident airplane make and model as SIC. The airplaneâs cockpit voice recorder (CVR) was located in the debris and was forwarded to the National Transportation Safety Board Vehicle Recorderâs Laboratory in Washington, DC. The wreckage was retained for further examination.METAR: METAR: At 14:35 LT: METAR KHSP 101835Z AUTO 27021G31KT 10SM M02/M09 A2965 RMK AO2 T10161090 PWINO At 14:55 LT: METAR KHSP 101855Z AUTO 28019G38KT 10SM SCT020 BKN024 OVC045 M02/M08 A2965 RMK AO2 T10221078 At 15:15 LT: METAR KHSP 101915Z AUTO 27019G33KT 10SM BKN020 BKN028 OVC038 M02/M09 A2966 RMK AO2 T10211087Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA24FA136 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: https://abcnews.go.com/US/twin-engine-plane-carrying-5-crashes-virginia-airport/story?id=107982625  https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/10/us/hot-springs-virginia-plane-crash/index.html  https://www.wdbj7.com/2024/03/10/plane-crashes-ingalls-field-airport/  https://www.wsls.com/news/local/2024/03/10/plane-crashes-at-airport-in-hot-springs/  https://wset.com/news/local/wreckage-no-longer-resembles-an-aircraft-ntsb-shares-details-about-deadly-plane-crash-ingalls-field-airport-bath-county-virginia-state-police-march-2024  NTSB  https://registry.faa.gov/AircraftInquiry/Search/NNumberResult?nNumberTxt=1125A  https://www.faa.gov/about/officeorg/headquartersoffices/avs/faa-certificated-aircraft-operators-legal-part-135-holders  https://globe.adsbexchange.com/?icao=a036a9  Location  Media:NTSB investigating Sunday's crash of an Israel Aircraft Industries 1125 Westwind Astra airplane near Hot Springs, Virginia.â NTSB Newsroom (@NTSB_Newsroom) March 10, 2024 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates10-Mar-2024 20:10 Captain Adam Added 10-Mar-2024 20:43 vasilf Updated [Aircraft type, Source, ]11-Mar-2024 06:07 RobertMB Updated [Time, Aircraft type, Registration, Cn, Operator, Total fatalities, Total occupants, Phase, Nature, Departure airport, Source, Embed code, Damage, Narrative, ]11-Mar-2024 06:16 ASN Updated [Embed code, Narrative, ]11-Mar-2024 06:44 Captain Adam Updated [Source, Narrative, Category, ]11-Mar-2024 15:00 Anon.

As a result, 3 cabin crew members and 10 passengers were injured to varying degrees (1 cabin crew member, 2 passengers were hospitalised due to the seriousness of their injuries). At the time of the occurrence, the aircraft was established at FL410. The left-hand cockpit seat initiated an involuntary forward movement. The recovery of the aircraft by the flight crew from the subsequent involuntary descent condition of approximately 400 feet did not exceed the positive or negative loads allowed by the manufacturer for this type of flight condition. Weather conditions and the lack of turbulence on the route at the time of the occurrence were not causal or contributing factors in the operation.

The aircraft was equipped with legacy Soloviev D-30 engines from the Soviet era, as opposed to the newer Aviadvigatel PS-90 engine used on new-build aircraft (Il-76MD-90A). The circumstances of the aircraft crash are similar to the accident of another Il-76 in 2022: https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20220624-0Sources: https://orenburg.ru/presscenter/news/157431/  https://78.ru/news/2024-03-12/orenburgskie-letchiki-pogibli-v-rezultate-krusheniya-il76  https://t.me/bazabazon/25782  https://t.me/bazabazon/25784  https://t.me/bazabazon/25785  https://t.me/bazabazon/25786  https://t.me/bazabazon/25789  https://t.me/izvestia/163781  https://t.me/readovkanews/75588  https://t.me/warhistoryalconafter/151720  https://t.me/breakingmash/52326  https://t.me/breakingmash/52328  https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/cargo-plane-crashes-russias-ivanovo-region-brief-2024-03-12/  https://t.me/vchkogpu/46574  Location  Media:Une vidÃ©o du crash de l'Il-76 dans la rÃ©gion d'Ivanovo a Ã©tÃ© publiÃ©e.16 personnes Ã  bord mortes.La principale version est un dysfonctionnement technique.

Southwest Airlines reported that their flight attendant jumpseat positions are as follows on the 737-800 aircraft: the A and C FA's are positioned in the forward galley and the B and D FA's are positioned in the aft galley. The flight crew reported that before the flight, the captain briefed the two forward galley position FAs to expect a ârough' ride after departure on the initial climb and that if smooth air was encountered it would not last long. He also informed them of a line of convective weather that they would need to deviate through, and that they should expect turbulence until they were well clear of that weather. Although the captain was not able to meet with the two aft galley FAs before departure, he was assured that the preflight briefing would be relayed to them. The flight crew reported that the climb and initial cruise flight was turbulent; however, they briefly experienced a smooth ride for about 20 minutes before the flight was expected to encounter another area of turbulence.   The captain stated that he had notified the FA's that if they got up, he wanted them in their seats at least five minutes before the expected turbulence and provided a specific time for them to be seated. After the brief smooth ride, the flight experienced the expected continuous light to moderate turbulence as the flight crew navigated through a line of convective weather.  The turbulence persisted longer than initially anticipated, so the captain called the FA's to advise them to expect continued turbulence. At this time, the captain was informed that the D position FA had injured herself by splashing a pot of coffee onto her head, face, and shoulders.  The B position FA reported that the captain had notified the FA's that the flight might encounter turbulence and to remain seated if the rough air materialized. Due to the smooth air encountered during the initial cruise portion of the flight, the FA's were able to quickly complete a passenger service and be reseated. The B position FA recalled that the captain had asked the FA's to take their seats before the second area of turbulence was encountered. The D position FA reported that she brewed a fresh pot of hot coffee for the passengers. After brewing the coffee, she picked up the coffee pot by its handle to pour a cup. However, at that moment, the aircraft encountered turbulence, causing the coffee pot to strike a handle near the coffee machine.  As a result, hot coffee splashed on her.   Upon being notified of the injury, the captain messaged dispatch via the aircraft communications addressing and reporting system and coordinated to have medical personnel meet the airplane upon arrival at the gate. The aircraft was met by paramedics who immediately transported the injured FA to a hospital where she was diagnosed with second degree burns.

While flying direct to KRVUR, the flight crew said that Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Air Traffic Control (ATC) gave the flight permission to descend to FL 310. As the airplane was descending, it approached some clouds that were visible in the moon light, and the captain activated the seat belt sign, and made a brief announcement as a precaution. The flight crew said that they then requested that ATC allow them to deviate to the left to avoid the highest cloud peaks that they could see, however at no time did the weather radar indicate any significant moisture returns.  The flight crew said they were unable to avoid entering the clouds and the flight briefly encountered âmoderateâ turbulence. As the flight exited those cloud tops, they then saw more clouds ahead, along with some indirect lightning nearby. The captain made an announcement to the cabin for the flight attendants (FAs) to take their jump seats, and about a minute later they entered the next set of cloud tops and experienced brief, but severe turbulence. The first officer (FO) said that the turbulence encounter lasted about 10 to 15 seconds with the altitude deviating a little, and the airplane rolling about 10 to 15 degrees. He also added that the auto throttle system, increased the thrust setting, which required that they reduce it manually.  After the turbulence event, the flight crew stated that they received a call from the cabin crew notifying them that a FA was injured. The injured FA stated that after completing cabin service they stowed the beverage carts in the back galley and within one minute of stowing the carts, they encountered âvery severeâ and unexpected turbulence. He said that the seatbelt sign was off, and he could not sit in the jump seats closest to him because they were all occupied by other flight attendants. He added that the flight was full and there were no passenger seats available as well, and the only available jump seats were far away. He said that as he reached to grab a handle near the carts he was suddenly thrown by the turbulence. He hit his head on the ceiling and came down on his right foot, resulting in a broken fibula.  After the turbulence ended the flight crew gathered more information from the cabin and made a pilot report (PIREP) to ATC indicating that there was an injured FA aboard and requested that emergency medical services personnel meet the airplane at the gate.  The first officer added that from his perspective, there was no indication of possible turbulence in the vicinity, and if it wasn't for the moon light making the clouds visible, the seat belt sign would most likely have not been activated, because the radar showed no reflection of moisture in the clouds. Probable Cause: An inadvertent encounter with convective turbulence that resulted in a serious injury to a flight attendant.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA24LA135 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=194001  https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/n6705y#34898192  https://www.flightaware.com/live/flight/DAL1253/history/20240328/0240Z/KATL/KTPA  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates28-Mar-2024 15:21 ASN Added 29-Mar-2024 10:28 ASN Updated [Time, Location, ]29-Mar-2024 10:29 ASN Updated [Category, ]17-May-2024 16:11 Captain Adam Updated [Time, Total occupants, Location, Source, Accident report, ]18-Jan-2025 13:07 Captain Adam Updated [Source, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

Of the 5 crew and 140 passengers onboard, one flight attendant and one passenger sustained serious injuries, and one flight attendant sustained minor injuries. The aircraft was not damaged. The flight was operating under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 as a scheduled passenger flight. The day of the accident, a major cold front was traversing the southeastern United States. The squall line of rapidly developing thunderstorms associated with the front extended south several hundred miles into the Gulf of Mexico. A convective Significant Meteorological Information (SIGMET) was issued at 1155 UTC for the area, warning pilots of cloud tops above 45,000 ft. A post-accident review of the weather showed a rapidly developing cell in the area of the accident consistent with the accident pilotsâ recollection described in the next paragraph. The captain stated that when he met with the flight attendants before departure and briefed them on the weather conditions, they agreed that, at the 10,000 ft chime, the flight attendants would decide amongst themselves if the ride was smooth enough to start their inflight service. The captain informed them that if the ride became too uncomfortable that they should take their jump seats and let the cockpit know that they were seated. As the aircraft climbed to altitude, the aircraft encountered occasional chop. They leveled the aircraft at flight level (FL) 370, above the weather system with the tops of the clouds at FL340 â FL350. The fasten seatbelt sign remained illuminated the entire flight. About 40 minutes into the flight and approaching the REMIS waypoint, the flight began to encounter light turbulence and the crew began deviations around cells before waypoint ROZZI. The visibility was intermittent instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) and marginal visual meteorological conditions (VMC) with occasional light chop. As they returned to their route to REMIS, the visibility improved and they visually acquired a rapidly developing cloud top that was on their flight path, but not painting on the onboard radar. The captain made a passenger announcement to ensure those in the cabin were seated and then contacted air traffic control (ATC) to request the deviation. The first officer (FO) began a right turn to avoid the cell, however, was not able to complete the turn in time and entered the cloud buildup. They encountered severe turbulence that lasted about 10 seconds that resulted in fluctuations up to 30Â°of bank, 20 knots airspeed, and 200 ft of altitude. Moderate turbulence followed for about 1 minute. According to flight data, vertical acceleration ranged from -0.45 gravitational force equivalent (g) to +1.8g during the turbulence encounter. Following the event, the flight crew coordinated with dispatch and decided to divert to Tampa International Airport (TPA), Tampa, Florida. They informed ATC of their intentions and were routed to TPA where they performed an uneventful landing, and medical personnel met the aircraft at the gate. The following NTSB specialists were assigned to investigate the accident: air traffic control, meteorology, and flight data recorder. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Southwest Airlines, and the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) are parties to the investigation. The flight data recorder data for the flight was downloaded by the operator and sent to NTSB headquarters for analysis. This analysis is ongoing. At the time of the encounter with turbulence, the aircraft was in Jacksonville (JAX) Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) airspace. While crew statements indicated they were aware of and monitoring rapidly developing cells, ATC audio indicated that the air traffic controller overseeing the flight did not provide specific information about the developing weather cell the aircraft penetrated to encounter the accident turbulence. NTSB investigators travelled to JAX ARTCC and conducted interviews of ATC personnel controlling the flight during the turbulence encounter. The investigation found that while the target number of aircraft for the sector was set at 20 (down from 23 due to increased complexity), the controller had significantly more aircraft on the frequency in the timeframe surrounding the accident. The controllerâs workload was further increased due to technical limitations with the temporary very high frequency (VHF) communications antenna the ARTCC was relying on to communicate with traffic after the primary VHF antenna was rendered inoperative in a fire in October 2023. FAA telecommunications infrastructure (FTI) had provided a satellite relay connection to assist with provision of operational frequencies, typically used in case of emergency situations. This caused a delay of transmission by 600 milliseconds round trip, resulting in clipped communication with a number of aircraft on the frequency. The controller described that these limitations required him to issue multiple repeated calls to multiple aircraft on the frequency increasing his workload and frequency congestion. The investigation is continuing.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA24FA143 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: https://www.kitv.com/news/national/passenger-flight-attendant-injured-during-severe-turbulence-on-southwest-flight/article_a9583e2a-1e0f-5752-8edc-fa72a4834b1e.html  NTSB  https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/n567wn#349dff56  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates04-Apr-2024 06:48 ASN Added 04-Apr-2024 06:48 ASN Updated [Aircraft type, ]04-Apr-2024 13:55 ASN Updated [Total occupants, Source, Narrative, ]17-May-2024 16:06 Captain Adam Updated [Time, Total occupants, Source, Narrative, Category, Accident report, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The captain reported he recognized the flight might encounter turbulence since he had encountered it on his previous flight. He stated that during the preflight briefing he informed the cabin crew to remain seated because they were expecting rough air, and it was a short flight. The captain reported that the departure and cruise segments of the flight were smooth and uneventful. On descent, around 14,000 feet, the aircraft encountered moderate turbulence before going into a cloud layer. Following the encounter, the first officer called the lead flight attendant (FA) to ensure everyone was ok while the captain asked air traffic control (ATC) for a right turn to avoid an approaching cloud buildup. The lead FA first reported that everything was ok, however shortly after the initial call, she called again to report that one of the FAs might have a broken leg. The injured FA stated that she was seated in the back of the aircraft and completing her last safety check when the turbulence lifted her out of her seat, and she landed forcefully on her right leg. Another flight attendant hit her head on the ceiling and fell, hurting her lower back. The captain transferred flight and communication duties to the first officer while the captain coordinated paramedics for the arrival into AVL. The captain then reported the turbulence to ATC and reassumed flight duty. The aircraft landed and arrived at the gate with no further issues. The paramedics met the airplane at the gate, and the seriously injured flight attendant was transported to the hospital and diagnosed with multiple fractures in her right leg. Post accident weather analysis suggested that the turbulence was likely caused by windshear associated with an upper front. A pilot from a different flight had reported moderate turbulence between 11,000 and 8,000 feet in a nearby area. However, there were no active advisories for turbulence in the location where the accident aircraft encountered turbulence. Probable Cause: An encounter with clear air turbulence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA24LA144 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket?ProjectID=194029  https://www.flightaware.com/live/flight/N899AT/history/20240403/0255Z/KATL/KAVL/tracklog  https://www.flightaware.com/live/flight/N899AT/history/20240403/1010Z/KAVL/KATL  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates29-Apr-2024 12:59 ASN Added 29-Apr-2024 13:00 ASN Updated [Departure airport, Destination airport, Narrative, ]29-Apr-2024 13:00 ASN Updated 17-May-2024 15:59 Captain Adam Updated [Time, Total occupants, Location, Phase, Departure airport, Destination airport, Narrative, Category, Accident report, ]16-Oct-2024 16:54 Captain Adam Updated [Source, Narrative, ]21-Oct-2024 08:29 ASN Updated [Accident report, ] Corrections or additions? ...

There were no injuries. The first officer (FO) was the pilot flying and the captain was the pilot monitoring on the flight. The flight crew had initially planned and set up for landing on runway 17L, but just before the descent, they were informed that the active runway had changed to runway 35R. They briefed the area navigation (required navigation performance) (RNAV [RNP]) Y approach for runway 35R before the descent. The approach was typical, with light turbulence in the descent. At approximately 6100 feet ASL, the landing gear was extended, flaps were set to 15Â°, and the propellers were set to 1020 rpm for landing. The approach speed was established at 132 knots indicated airspeed. The surface winds were reported to be from 330Â° at 10 knots, gusting to 20 knots. No additive for the gust was made to the approach speed. The autopilot was turned off at 500 feet above ground level (AGL) and the remainder of the approach was hand flown by the FO. From 500 feet AGL to touchdown, the power levers were adjusted up and down 12 times between 22% torque and 4% torque. Once below 350 feet AGL on approach, the aircraftâs descent path varied above and below the 3Â° approach descent path. During this time, the captain made 3 calls to the FO to increase power. The FO responded by increasing power each time; however, the last increase in power was quickly followed by a reduction in power to 4% torque. The aircraft crossed the runway 35R threshold at 65 feet AGL. Over the next 6 seconds, the aircraft experienced a performance-degrading wind gust with an approximate speed of 8 knots. The FO began to increase the nose-up attitude to start the flare, slowing the aircraft to 120 knots calibrated airspeed. Two seconds before touchdown, the pitch attitude increased from 5Â° to 8.3Â° and the power levers were advanced. At touchdown, the power increased to 8% torque, and then up to 18% torque after touchdown. At 14:52:26, the aft fuselage of the aircraft contacted the runway approximately 1070 feet beyond the threshold.METAR: CYYC 131900Z VRB02KT 40SM FEW079 BKN250 14/M07 A2980 RMK AC1CI6 CONTRAILS SLP108 DENSITY ALT 4500FT CYYC 132000Z 27003KT 190V330 40SM FEW090 FEW190 BKN250 15/M07 A2978 RMK AC1AC2CI5 AC TR CONTRAILS SLP104 DENSITY ALT 4700FT CYYC 132100Z 33012G20KT 260V350 40SM FEW110 BKN200 17/M08 A2978 RMK AC1CC7 AC TR SLP102 DENSITY ALT 4800FTAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A24W0038 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: TSB A24W0038  https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/c-gjwe#34c2b0df History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  15 February 2019 C-GJWE WestJet Encore 0 Fort St. John Airport, BC (YXJ/CYXJ) min Collision with Ground support equipment 28 September 2021 C-GJWE WestJet 0 37 nm SSE of Terrace, BC non Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates05-Jun-2024 19:07 ASN Added 05-Jun-2024 19:08 ASN Updated [Time, Location, Source, Damage, ]05-Jun-2024 19:09 ASN Updated 26-Nov-2024 19:40 ASN Updated [Total occupants, Accident report, ]26-Nov-2024 20:17 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

According to the pilots, a pilot-in-command proficiency check flight was being conducted, with a designated pilot examiner utilizing the flight deck jump seat. Prior to performing a simulated single engine approach to runway 17 at Ravalli County Airport (HRF), Hamilton, Montana, the pilot in command (PIC) noticed that the hydraulic reservoir display was âat the bottom limit in the yellow arc.â All pre-landing checklist items were completed, including brake function checks.  After landing on runway 17, during the landing roll, the airplane began to veer right of centerline, and the PIC added left rudder correction. A vibration developed and increased as the airplane continued to veer to the right. Despite the PICâs application of left brake and additional rudder inputs, the airplane continued to veer right, exited the runway, and struck a runway light, taxiway light and taxiway sign.

The two pilots were fatally injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 flight.  The accident airplane, owned and operated by Alaska Air Fuel, Inc., was transporting 3,400 gallons of unleaded fuel and two 100-gallon propane tanks. The airplane departed from the Fairbanks International Airport (FAI) at about 0955 Alaska daylight time (AKDT) with a destination of the Kobuk Airport (OBU) Kobuk, Alaska. Shortly after takeoff an eyewitness reported seeing the airplane flying to the west, with the far left engine (No. 1) not running. The witness also noticed a small, white plume of smoke coming from that engine. The witness reported the airplane began a turn to the south at which point he noticed the engine was on fire. Recovered surveillance video shows white smoke behind the number one engine, followed by flames. The video also revealed that seconds later a bright white explosion is seen just behind the number one engine followed by fragments of airplane wreckage falling to the ground. The airplane then begins an uncontrolled descending left turn into terrain. The No. 1 engine separated from the wing about 100 ft above the ground and eventually came to rest on the frozen Tanana River.  A preliminary review of archived voice communication information from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) revealed that shortly after departure from FAI at 1,000, the pilot contacted the departure air traffic control (ATC) specialist on duty, stating that there was âa fire on boardâ and that they needed to return to the airport.  The accident airplane was equipped with Automatic Dependent SurveillanceâBroadcast (ADSâ B), which provides aircraft position information via satellite navigation or other sensors and periodically broadcasts it, enabling the aircraft to be tracked. The information can be received by air traffic control ground stations as a replacement for secondary surveillance radar, as no interrogation signal is needed from the ground. According to archived FAA ADS-B data, after the airplane departed FAI, it initially proceeded southwest, then it turned westbound. The airplane then began a left turn back to FAI. The ADSB data eventually stopped near where the witness observed the accident airplane impact terrain.  The accident airplane was also equipped was Spidertracks. Spidertracks enables real-time flight tracking, automated flight watch, two-way communication, and flight data monitoring (FDM) for aircraft. The operatorâs archived Spidertracks data has been collected for further analysis.  A large postcrash fire ensued, which incinerated much of the airplane's structure. The No.1 engine was recovered, and a detailed engine examination is pending.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ANC24FA029 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/douglas-dc-4-plane-crash-fairbanks-alaska/  https://alaskapublic.org/2024/04/23/rescuers-responding-to-plane-crash-along-tanana-river-near-fairbanks/  https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/plane-crash-fairbanks-alaska-rescue-b2533569.html  https://abc7news.com/alaska-news-pilot-reported-fire-onboard-plane-carrying-fuel-attempted-to-return-fairbanks-just-before-crash/14729111/?ex_cid=TA_KGO_TW&taid=6629e363029dc600017ab569  NTSB  https://registry.faa.gov/AircraftInquiry/Search/NNumberResult?nNumberTxt=N3054V  https://www.flightaware.com/live/flight/N3054V/history/20240423/1816Z/PAFA/L%2064.74248%20-148.08014~  https://cdn.jetphotos.com/full/5/2935864_1688407807.jpg (photo) History of this aircraft Ex N76AU, N62296, US Navy Bu:91994, Royal Air Force KL977, USAAF 42-72442 Location  Images: N3054V at Wasilla, June 2023; photo: King Hui (CC:by-sa) Media:A Douglas C-54 operated by Alaska Air Fuel, was destroyed when it crashed into a hill on the bank of the Tanana River, about six minutes after takeoff from Fairbanks International Airport, Alaska.

Hobby Airport (HOU/KHOU), Houston, TX -   United States of America","Landing","Passenger - Scheduled","Dallas-Love Field, TX (DAL/KDAL)","Houston-William P. Hobby Airport, TX (HOU/KHOU)"," NTSB","Information verified through data from accident investigation authorities","On May 3, 2024, about 1800 central daylight time (CDT), Delux Public Charter, doing business as JSX flight 284, an Embraer EMB-145LR experienced a left main landing gear (LMLG) collapse during landing at Houston Hobby International Airport (HOU), Houston, Texas. Of the 3 crew and 21 passengers onboard, one crew member sustained minor injuries. The aircraft was substantially damaged. The flight was a public charter sold by JSX, as the charter operator (subject to provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 380) and operated by Delux Public Charter, LLC as the direct air carrier (operating under the provisions of Title 14 CFR Part 135) as a nonscheduled passenger flight from Dallas Love Field airport (DAL), Dallas, Texas to HOU. The flight crew described an uneventful takeoff, climb, cruise, and descent. The flight data indicated the airspeed, vertical speed, and glide path were stabilized during the majority of the final approach. Surface winds during the approach at HOU were reported from 130 degrees at 16 knots, gusting to 24 knots. As the aircraft flew over the threshold of runway 4 at HOU, the flight crew described a feeling that there was something wrong, and the captain, who was the pilot flying, called for a go-around. The aircraft landed hard shortly thereafter. While the crew did not recall initiating the go-around, flight data showed an increase in throttle lever angle consistent with commanding go-around thrust that began shortly before impact. Flight data indicated that the vertical load factor during the touchdown was 3.9 gravitational constants (g). As the aircraft continued down the runway, the LMLG collapsed and punctured through the left-wing upper skin. The aircraft came to a stop on the left side of the runway about 567 ft from the end. Emergency personnel responded to the accident and assisted the passengers as they deplaned through the main cabin door (L1). The first officer was transported to a local hospital for minor injuries. Visual inspection of the LMLG showed structural damage and deformation, in addition to hydraulic fluid leakage. The left wing spar III, a principal structural element, was bent and fractured through at 2 locations and partially fractured at 3 additional locations. While there was damage to some of the left wingâs structural components, the fuel tank was not compromised during the event. Most of the structural damage to the inboard section of the wing was consistent with a strong upward force from the LMLG. Damage to the outboard section of the wing was consistent with the wing scraping the runway surface and impacting runway lights. The following NTSB specialists were assigned to investigate the accident: Airworthiness, Operations, Human Performance, Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR), and Flight Data Recorder (FDR). The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Delux Public Charter are parties to the investigation. The airplane was designed and manufactured in Brazil, and pursuant to International Civil Aviation Organization Annex 13, Centro de InvestigaÃ§Ã£o e PrevenÃ§Ã£o de Acidentes AeronÃ¡uticos (CENIPA) assigned an Accredited Representative to the investigation and designated Embraer as a technical advisor. The CVR and FDR were removed from the aircraft by NTSB investigators and were shipped to NTSB headquarters in Washington, DC where they were successfully downloaded. The aircraft wreckage was documented during the on-scene portion of the investigation and flight crew interviews were conducted via video conference on May 5, 2024.  The investigation continues.METAR: KHOU 032353Z 13009KT 10SM BKN100 BKN250 26/20 A2984 RMK AO2 SLP111 60006 T02560200 10272 20239 56019 KHOU 032253Z 13016G24KT 10SM SCT100 BKN250 26/20 A2985 RMK AO2 SLP112 T02610200Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA24FA179 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: https://www.fox26houston.com/news/small-plane-at-hobby-airport-has-landing-gear-collapse  https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/n942jx#350dbd1e  NTSB  Location  Media: Plane safely arrives at Hobby Airport after experiencing landing gear collapse, officials say https://t.co/aUEl12GKegâ ABC13 Houston (@abc13houston) May 4, 2024 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates04-May-2024 05:24 gerard57 Added 04-May-2024 06:27 ASN Updated [Aircraft type, Registration, Cn, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, ]04-May-2024 06:29 ASN Updated [Time, Location, Narrative, ]04-May-2024 06:31 ASN Updated [Embed code, ]04-May-2024 16:00 Aerossurance Updated [Embed code, ]05-May-2024 13:32 Captain Adam Updated [Location, Embed code, Damage, Narrative, Category, ]18-Jun-2024 23:00 Captain Adam Updated [Time, Source, Narrative, Accident report, ] Corrections or additions? ...

One passenger died, 30 other occupants suffered injuries requiring hospital treatment.  At 07:49:21 UTC the aircraft was passing over the south of Myanmar at 37,000 ft and likely flying over an area of developing convective activity. The Gravitational force (G), recorded as vertical accelerations, fluctuated between positive (+ve) 0.44G and +ve 1.57G for a period of about 19 seconds. This would have caused the flight to begin to experience slight vibration. Around the same time as the onset of the slight vibration, an uncommanded increase in aircraft altitude, reaching a peak of 37,362 ft, was recorded. In response to this uncommanded altitude increase, the autopilot pitched the aircraft downwards to descend back to the selected altitude of 37,000 ft.  In addition, the pilots observed an uncommanded increase in airspeed which they arrested by extending the speed brakes. While managing the airspeed, at 07:49:32 hr, it was heard that a pilot called out that the fasten seat belt sign had been switched on. This uncommanded increase in aircraft altitude and airspeed were most likely due to the aircraft being acted upon by an updraft (the upward movement of air). The autopilot was engaged during this period.  At 07:49:40 hr, the aircraft experienced a rapid change in G as recorded vertical acceleration decreased from +ve 1.35G to negative (-ve) 1.5G, within 0.6 sec. This likely resulted in the occupants who were not belted up to become airborne. At 07:49:41 hr, the vertical acceleration changed from -ve 1.5G to +ve 1.5G within 4 sec. This likely resulted in the occupants who were airborne to fall back down. The rapid changes in G over the 4.6 sec duration resulted in an altitude drop of 178 ft, from 37,362 ft to 37,184 ft. This sequence of events likely caused the injuries to the crew and passengers. In the midst of the sequence of rapid changes in G, recorded data indicated that the pilots initiated control inputs to stabilise the aircraft, disengaging the autopilot in this process. The pilots manually controlled the aircraft for 21 sec and reengaged the autopilot at 07:50:05 hr. The recorded vertical acceleration showed more gradual fluctuations over the next 24 sec, ranging from +ve 0.9G to +ve 1.1G, while the aircraft returned to 37,000 ft at 07:50:23 hr. After the pilots were informed by the cabin crew that there were injured passengers in the cabin, the decision was made to divert to Suvarnabhumi Airport, Bangkok, Thailand. On the way to Bangkok, the pilots requested for medical services to meet the aircraft on arrival. Approximately 17 minutes after the turbulence event, at 08:06:51 hr, the pilots initiated a normal, controlled descent from 37,000 ft and the aircraft reached 31,000 ft at 08:10:00 hr. The data showed that the aircraft did not encounter further severe turbulence during this diversion, and touched down in Suvarnabhumi Airport at 08:45:12 hr.Sources: https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/9v-swm#354eb60f  https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fsingaporeair%2Fposts%2Fpfbid01ETziy2xcUF8R5CKeg8CoKsqHsVHhhhw5Cp9UxvefpWmzCetfit82Xa2nUQ8LqVVl&show_text=true&width=500&is_preview=true  https://www.mot.gov.sg/news/details/transport-safety-investigation-bureau-preliminary-investigation-findings-of-incident-involving-sq321  Location  Media:Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates21-May-2024 11:32 TomPouce67 Added 21-May-2024 11:34 ASN Updated [Aircraft type, Cn, Operator, Source, Embed code, ]21-May-2024 11:36 ASN Updated [Narrative, ]21-May-2024 15:36 ASN Updated [Time, Location, Country, Narrative, Category, ]29-May-2024 16:13 ASN Updated [Source, Damage, Narrative, ]30-Dec-2024 16:33 Anon.

The aircraft departed Mzuzu Airport (ZZU) at 07:04  local time, and arrived at Lilongwe Airport (LLW) at 07:52.  The airplane was refuelled and the six passengers, among them the Vice President of Malawi, boarded the aircraft. The flight took off from LLW at 09:16 and received climb clearance to FL90. Later, the flight crew requested to maintain 7,000 ft AMSL. At about 09:23 the airplane reached a cruise level of about 7,300 ft (GPS altitude). At 09:50 hrs the aircraft began to deviate from the direct course to ZZU by entering a left-hand turn. From  then on the flight followed an erratic course at varying altitudes and several 360 degree turns. At 10:12 hrs, the flight crew had reported in on the Mzuzu Tower frequency and informed him that they were 20 NM away and intended an approach from the north. The Flight Information Officer communicated the weather information and that runway 17 was in use. He also informed them about his observation that east, south and west of the airport visibility was about 5 km.  Four minutes later the aircraft impacted a hillside, 34 km (18 NM) south-west of ZZU. First, the aircraft collided with the trunk of a tree with the outer part of the right wing at a height of about 4.5 m above ground. The airplaneâs lower fuselage surface then impacted the ground and the aircraft broke up until the main wreckage had come to rest on the slope about 80 m from the tree.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BFU Report number: BFU24-0508-DX Status: Preliminary reportDuration: 2 monthsDownload report:  Preliminary report Sources: https://mwnation.com/veep-chilimas-plane-goes-missing/  https://www.nyasatimes.com/teary-malawians-wait-with-unabated-breath-as-rescue-mission-continue-to-search-for-chilimas-missing-aircraft/  https://www.faceofmalawi.com/2024/06/11/chilima-dies-in-plane-crash/  https://malawi24.com/2024/06/11/chilima-crash-site-identified/  https://www.maravipost.com/tragic-malawi-veep-saulos-chilima-nine-others-die-in-plane-crash/  https://www.maravipost.com/mdf-confirms-chilimas-plane-crashed-in-chikangawa-forest/  https://www.africanews.com/2024/06/12/malawi-announces-state-funeral-and-21-days-of-mourning-for-vice-president-killed-in-a-plan/  https://www.bfu-web.de/DE/Home/Nachrichten/100724_Untersuchung_Malawi.html  https://www.scramble.nl/database/civil/details/do228_153  https://imgproc.airliners.net/photos/airliners/3/0/3/1096303.jpg (photo)  Images: Photo: BFU Media:Imaged below showing The missing plane in chikangawa forest..#breakingnews #malawi #missingplane #MbuziTvMw pic.twitter.com/zwXoTwJ9RDâ MbuziTv (@MbuziTvMw) June 11, 2024 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates10-Jun-2024 16:23 4Holerpoler Added 10-Jun-2024 16:25 ASN Updated [Aircraft type, Total fatalities, Location, Source, Damage, Narrative, ]10-Jun-2024 17:32 Ephata Updated [Country, ]11-Jun-2024 05:35 lagi Updated [Aircraft type, Registration, Cn, Source, Embed code, Narrative, ]11-Jun-2024 07:45 lagi Updated [Registration, Source, ]11-Jun-2024 09:54 Iceman 29 Updated [Total fatalities, Source, Embed code, Damage, ]11-Jun-2024 12:32 Rod K Updated [Embed code, Narrative, ]11-Jun-2024 14:12 lagi Updated [Location, Source, Embed code, Narrative, ]21-Jun-2024 08:40 luca Updated [Total fatalities, Total occupants, Source, Narrative, ]13-Jul-2024 14:20 ASN Updated [Source, Narrative, Photo, ]30-Aug-2024 11:24 ASN Updated [Time, Accident report, ]30-Aug-2024 16:33 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

On final approach to runway 19 the aircraft collided with a snow barrier 955 m short of the runway. It then touched down at 2.2 G with the left wing impacting the snow barrier. The aircraft swung and came to rest with the fuselage broken in two. The pilot-in-command, co-pilot and a passenger were seriously injured. Meteorological conditions at the time of the incident: visibility 2400 m, significant cloud haze 90 m, wind 8 m/s. Passengers were evacuated to the airport terminal building. The PIC, co-pilot and passenger (woman) were provided with medical assistance.  Utrenny Airport was constructed to allow shift workers to be flown to the Arctic LNG 2 project. Conclusion:  The aviation accident involving the An-26-100 RA-26662 aircraft occurred during the day, during an approach for landing in meteorological conditions below the established minimum operational limit of the airport. This resulted in the aircraft landing approximately 955 meters short of the runway threshold and colliding with a snow barrier.  Contributing factors included:  - The decision by the flight commander to continue the flight to the destination airport and to execute the landing approach, despite having information about meteorological conditions at the destination airport below the established operational minimum; - The crew's failure to maintain flight parameters that meet the criteria for a stabilized approach to landing, as well as their failure to go around when these were not met; - Descending below the established minimum descent altitude (MDA/H) with insufficient visual contact with ground landmarks necessary for making a landing decision; - The flight commander's (crew's) error in recognizing the runway and its landmarks; - Breakdowns in coordination, as well as insufficient crew resource management by the flight commander.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: https://t.me/aviaincident/32263  https://t.me/uraltransprok/5553  https://t.me/aviatorshina/4787  https://mak-iac.org/rassledovaniya/an-26-100-ra-26662-14-06-2024/  Preliminary Report: https://mak-iac.org/upload/iblock/bc9/8phss16w68qia8547ra6mt64nrxs49wi/pr_report_ra-26662.pdf  Final Report: https://mak-iac.org/upload/iblock/ff4/0dbgek9yrtmpufli1gaknx9e20pjn1mm/report_ra-26662.pdf   Location  Images: Photo: Ural Transport Prosecutor's Office Photo: MAK Media:#BREAKING ð·ðºâï¸| Russian An-26-100 made an emergency landing in Yamal.

While at cruise altitude, the Pilot Flying (the captain) briefed the area navigation global navigation satellite system (RNAV [GNSS]) Z approach to Runway 27. Based on the landing weight and the flaps set at 15Â°, the planned target landing reference speed (VREF) was 124 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS), and the flight crew added a 10-knot buffer, increasing the planned approach speed to 134 KIAS. At 1356, the flight was cleared to land, and the control tower reported the winds to be from 350Â° magnetic at 11 knots. At 13:59:30, when the aircraft was 267 feet above touchdown zone elevation (TDZE), the PF disconnected the autopilot and began to fly the approach manually. When the aircraft was 135 feet above the TDZE, the aircraft was travelling at 126 KIAS, the descent rate was 700 fpm, and the pitch was 3.2Â°. When the aircraft was 20 feet above the TDZE, it was travelling at 124 KIAS, the descent rate had increased to 980 fpm, and the pitch was 1.1Â°. The headwind component decreased from 5.5 knots to 0.5 knots within 3 seconds, increasing the maximum descent rate to 1050 fpm. In response, over a period of 2 seconds, the PF increased the pitch from 1.1Â° to 6.8Â°. The power was consistently at 14% torque. At 13:59:53, the right main landing gear contacted the runway, followed by the left main landing gear. A vertical acceleration of 3.51 g was recorded. After the initial contact with the runway, the aircraft bounced, and the flight crew initiated a go-around in accordance with Porter Airlinesâ standard operating procedures (SOPs). Two seconds later, a second runway contact occurred with a recorded vertical acceleration of 1.42 g. After the first touchdown, the TOUCHED RUNWAY warning light illuminated, indicating that a sensor near the tail section of the aircraft had been triggered by contact with the runway surface. In addition, the master warning light started flashing. During the climbout, the flight crew noticed the master warning and TOUCHED RUNWAY warning lights; however, they did not discuss the issue further at that time. The flight crew were cleared by the tower controller to conduct a visual flight rules circuit and return to land. The aircraft landed uneventfully at 1408, and the flight crew taxied the aircraft to the apron and shut it down. Damage to the lower portion of the aft fuselage section was identified and company flight operations personnel were notified.METAR: CYFC 281600Z AUTO 33015G20KT 9SM SCT066 SCT075 21/07 A2996 RMK SLP147 DENSITY ALT 700FT CYFC 281700Z AUTO 32014KT 9SM BKN071 BKN080 21/10 A2997 RMK SLP152 DENSITY ALT 800FT CYFC 281800Z AUTO 30009G16KT 9SM FEW066 21/08 A2998 RMK SLP153 DENSITY ALT 800FTAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A24A0038 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: https://www.reddit.com/r/rampagent/comments/1dqps00/just_witnessed_my_first_q400_tail_strike_at_work/  https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/c-glqp#35e5e56a Media:A Porter Airlines Dash 8-400 damaged following a tail-strike while landing at Fredericton Airport, Canada.Photo: Respective OwnerTelegram Channel: https://t.co/KUkXqwLO2W pic.twitter.com/XipAlwvw8vâ AviatorsMaldives (@AviatorsMaldive) June 29, 2024 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates03-Jul-2024 05:34 ASN Added 03-Jul-2024 05:35 ASN Updated [Location, Embed code, Narrative, ]16-Jul-2024 14:08 ASN Updated [Total occupants, Damage, Narrative, ]06-Feb-2025 15:25 ASN Updated [Narrative, Accident report, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The pilot continued the approach and while in visual flight rules conditions and noted rain over the runway about 1,000 ft from the threshold. The pilot landed the airplane on the grooved asphalt runway and observed that there was no standing water. During the landing roll, the airplane encountered heavy rain and the pilot stated that it began âhydroplaningâ toward the right side of the runway. The right wing of the airplane then impacted 3 edge lights and one location sign before the pilot was able to regain control and then taxi off the runway and to the ramp. The airplaneâs right wing was substantially damaged during the accident sequence. The pilot stated that there preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures of the airplane that would have precluded normal operation. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that there was no evidence of tread rubber reversion on either main landing gear tire that would be associated with hydroplaning during landing.

A safe landing was made back at SOC 80 minutes after takeoff. While climbing through FL343 to the intended cruising altitude of FL380, the aircraft experienced an engine malfunction. The ECAM indicated 'ENG 1 STALL', and immediately a strong vibration was felt, followed by the 'ENG1 Fail' indication on the ECAM. After performing the ECAM procedures, the flight crew decided to return to Solo with engine no.1 inoperative. During descent, the vibration level was not reduced. While approaching Solo, a spurious 'ENG 1 fire' appeared on the ECAM with 'ENG 1 LOOP B FAULT', but no fire was observed on the engine during visual check by the other crewmembers. The aircraft landed and stopped on the runway, then after a few minutes, smoke, fire and flames appeared on the engine no. 1.Sources: https://twitter.com/GerryS/status/1808139448326279252  https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/t7-mmm#35f48d5e  https://bea.aero/en/investigation-reports/notified-events/detail/accident-to-the-airbus-a330-registered-t7-mmm-operated-by-garuda-on-02-07-2024-at-surakarta/ History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  22 May 2020 B-LNM Hong Kong Airlines 0 Hong Kong International Airport non Runway incursion Images: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates02-Jul-2024 15:56 ASN Added 02-Jul-2024 17:56 Anon.

The pilot and five passengers were not injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.  The pilot reported the flight proceeded uneventfully until landing. The air traffic controller advised him that the Black Hills Airport-Clyde Ice Field (SPF) runway was covered with 1/8â of wet snow. However, the runway braking action was reported as 5/5/5 (touchdown/midpoint/rollout) meaning that braking action was good and all portions of the runway wet including the presence snow. The airport was in sight about 4 miles out, and the pilot executed a straight-in approach to runway 13. He verified that the landing gear was down. His intention was to touchdown at the landing reference speed (Vref) to minimize the need for braking. He disconnected the autopilot at 2 miles from the runway, and the airplane appeared to be lined up with the extended runway centerline.  The pilot recalled that during landing, about 8 to 10 feet above ground level (agl), he received an aerodynamic stall warning with the stick shaker. At first, the touchdown seemed normal, but then the airplane started drifting to the left. The pilot efforts to maintain directional control were not successful. The airplane âlurched hardâ when it impacted the snowbank along the left side of the runway. When the airplane came to rest, he shut down the engine, and the airplane was evacuated.  One of the passengers reported that he was seated behind the right-side (co-pilot) seat and had a âgood viewâ out of the windshield. He confirmed seeing the 3-green landing gear down lights while on approach. He noted that the airplane appeared to be aligned with but was slightly left of the runway centerline. As the airplane touched down, it quickly drifted to the left.  The left wing then caught the snowbank, and the airplane departed the left side of the runway. The airplane ultimately came to rest with the nose perpendicular to and facing the runway. The passenger recalled that when he exited the airplane, the wind was almost calm.  A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector responded to the accident site the following day. He reported that the airplane had been moved to the ramp area of the airport. The right wing had substantial sustained damage which included deformation and delamination of the wing structure, partial separation of the right aileron, and damage to the fuel tank. The left main landing gear was extended, the right main landing gear was retracted in the wheel well, and the nose landing gear was collapsed. When the right landing gear was extended after recovery, the tire was still on the wheel rim and appeared intact, but the tire was flat.  The FAA inspector observed runway wheel marks (compressed snow) that corresponded to the accident airplane. The airplane appeared to have touched down about 150 feet before the 1,000-foot / touchdown zone markers. At touchdown, the left main wheel was 6 to 8 feet from the left side of the runway. The airplane departed the left side of the runway about 140 feet after it touched down. The snowbanks on each side of the runway were 2 to 3-feet high. The airplane struck two runway edge lights during the excursion.  Further examination of the airplane and download of available onboard data is pending.

Eisenhower National Airport, KS (ICT/KICT)","Washington-Ronald Reagan National Airport, DC (DCA/KDCA)"," NTSB","Information is only available from news, social media or unofficial sources","American Eagle flight 5342, a Bombardier CRJ-701ER operated by PSA Airlines and a US Army Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter, callsign PAT25, collided in midair and crashed into the Potomac River near Washington-Ronald Reagan National Airport, DC (DCA). All 64 occupants of the CRJ-701 and the three soldiers in the Army helicopter died in the accident. The Black Hawk helicopter was from the Bravo Company, 12th Aviation Battalion, Davison Army Airfield, Fort Belvoir, Virginia. It was flying at low altitude over the Potomac River from north to south while on a combined annual and night vision goggle check ride for the pilot flying. The crew is believed to have been wearing their night vision goggles. Flight 5342 took off from Wichita Airport, Kansas (ICT) at 17:38 local time (23:38 UTC). Prior to descent, the flight crew briefed the expected arrival procedure (TRUPS FIVE) for an ILS approach to runway 01 at DCA. Descent began at 20:15 ET. At 20:30 local time (01:30 UTC), the Black Hawk helicopter, PAT25, begins traveling generally southbound after maneuvering near Laytonsville, MD. Cockpit voice recorder (CVR) data indicates the instructor pilot was pilot monitoring (PM), and the check ride pilot was pilot flying (PF). At 20:33:41, PAT25 requests the Tower for helicopter routes 1 to 4 to Davison Army Airfield (KDAA), which was approved. At 20:38:39, PAT25 reaches the intersection of the DC Beltway and the Potomac River near Carderock, MD, begins descending, and picks up route 1 over the river towards downtown Washington, DC. At 20:39:10, the Potomac Approach controller cleared the flight for the Mount Vernon visual approach to runway 01. Four minutes later the crew contacted DCA Tower. The controller asked if the crew could switch to an approach to runway 33. After a brief discussion between the crew, they agreed to runway 33. At 20:43:48, PAT25 was 1.1 nautical miles (nmi) west of the Key Bridge. At this point, the PF had an indicated altitude of 300 ft, while the PM had an indicated altitude of 400 ft. Neither pilot commented on the discrepancy. At 20:44:41, the CRJ begins selecting flaps 30, then flaps 40. Eight seconds later, their landing gear was down and locked, with the aircraft fully configured for landing at 6.2 nmi south of the airport. At 20:45:27, the CRJ's autopilot was disconnected, and it began a shallow right turn off the path of the localizer at a radio altitude of 1700 ft and airspeed of 134 kt. They were 5 nmi south of the airport. Three seconds later, PAT25 passed over the Memorial Bridge. The PM told the PF they were at 300 ft and needed to descend, with the PF responding they would descend to 200 ft. At 20:46:01, the Tower controller called PAT25, advising them that a CRJ was at 1200 feet just south of the Woodrow Wilson Bridge circling to runway 33. This communication was audible from the CRJ, but the portion stating the traffic was ""circling"" may not have been heard by PAT25. Seven seconds later, PAT25 responded they had the traffic in sight and requested visual separation, which was approved by the Tower. At 20:46:29, the crew of the CRJ700 received a 1,000 ft automated call out. At 20:47:27, PAT25 passed the southern tip of Hains Point, a second before the CJR began its left roll to final for runway 33 at 133 kt of airspeed. Another second later, the crew of the CRJ700 received a 500 ft automated call out. At 20:47:39, DCA Tower called PAT25 asking them if they had the CRJ in sight. This was audible in both CVRs. A conflict alert was audible in the background of the Tower's transmission. At 20:47:40, the crew of the CRJ700 received an automated Traffic Advisory call out ('Traffic, Traffic'). At 20:47:42, the Tower directed PAT 25 to pass behind the CRJ. This was audible in both CVRs, but PAT25's CVR data indicates the portion of the transmission stating ""pass behind the"" may not have been received by PAT25 due to the crew keying their mic for 0.8 seconds, stepping on the Tower's transmission. Two seconds later, PAT25's crew stated they had the traffic in sight, and requested visual separation, which was again approved. The PM told the PF they believed ATC wanted them to move left, towards the east bank of the Potomac river. At 20:47:58, the CRJ700 started increasing its pitch after a verbal reaction from the crew, with almost full deflection of the elevators. A second later, a collision occurred. While the Tower communicated simultaneously in two VHF frequencies, PAT25 and the CRJ700 were communicating separately in one of each of those frequencies. This meant they could both hear the Tower, and vice-versa, but could not hear each other's transmissions. The last radio altitude recorded by the CRJ700, two seconds before impact, was 313 ft, and their descent rate was 448 ft/min. Their pitch reached 9Â° nose up after the crew's reaction, as well as 11Â° left wing down of roll. PAT25's last recorded radio altitude was 278 ft, steady for the previous 5 seconds. Their pitch at collision time was about 0.5Â° nose up, with 1.6Â° of left roll. NTSB: National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy told reporters that the recording from the UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter cockpit suggested an incomplete radio transmission may have left the crew without understanding how it should shift position seconds before the crash. âThat transmission was interrupted, it was stepped on,â she said, leaving them unable to hear the words âpass behind theâ because the helicopterâs microphone key was pressed at the same moment. Cockpit conversations a few minutes before the crash indicated conflicting altitude data, with the helicopterâs pilot calling out that they were then at 300 feet (91 meters), but the instructor pilot saying they were at 400 feet (122 meters), Homendy said.METAR: KDCA 300152Z 30014G23KT 270V330 10SM CLR 10/M07 A2990 RMK AO2 PK WND 30033/0108 SLP126 T01001072 KDCA 300052Z 29015G25KT 10SM CLR 11/M07 A2987 RMK AO2 SLP114 T01061072 Sources: https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/live-blog/live-updates-plane-crashes-potomac-river-collision-helicopter-reagan-n-rcna189942  https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/plane-crash-dca-potomac-washington-dc-01-29-25/index.html  https://www.arlnow.com/2025/01/29/breaking-aircraft-crash-reported-near-national-airport/  https://registry.faa.gov/AircraftInquiry/Search/NNumberResult?nNumberTxt=709PS  https://www.flightaware.com/live/flight/N709PS/history/20250129/2328Z/KICT/KDCA  https://airlive.net/military/2025/02/16/an-incomplete-radio-transmission-may-have-left-the-black-hawk-pilots-with-no-idea-they-were-supposed-to-pass-behind-the-plane/  https://cdn.jetphotos.com/full/5/61280_1622165838.jpg (photo)  NTSB :  https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/Pages/DCA25MA108.aspx  https://www.flickr.com/photos/ntsb/albums/72177720323544846/ History of this aircraft Ex N165MD, (N709PS), C-FCHO,C-GIAD Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  15 February 2017 N709PS PSA Airlines, opf American Eagle 0 Charlotte-Douglas International Airport, NC (CLT/KCLT) sub 27 June 2018 N709PS PSA Airlines, opf American Eagle 0 Harrisburg International Airport, PA (MDT/KMDT) min 26 March 2021 N709PS PSA Airlines, opf American Eagle 0 North Canton, Ohio min Windscreen cracks or failure Location  Images: N709PS at Charlotte Douglas International in April 2022 (photo: Colin Brown) Photo: U.S. Coast Guard Media:An incomplete radio transmission may have left the Black Hawk pilots with no idea they were supposed to pass behind the plane https://t.co/ZenbDJcl8t— AIRLIVE (@airlivenet) February 16, 2025 Few more clearer visuals show the moment of collision between the American Airlines CRJ700 aircraft (N709PS) and Blackhawk UH-60 Helicopter (PAT25) over Potomac River the the Washington DC.#accident #aviation #airlines #aircraft https://t.co/xNRcbJEXbU pic.twitter.com/4ky64G9jnDâ FL360aero (@fl360aero) January 31, 2025 ð¨#BREAKING: Shared to me anonymously shows the Playback from official Air Traffic Control radar ð#Washington | #DCWatch as exclusive playback, sent anonymously by @avgeekjake to Rawsalerst, reveals official Air Traffic Control radar footage displaying the Collision Alert.â¦ pic.twitter.com/s2SvT2OTPJâ R A W S A L E R T S (@rawsalerts) January 30, 2025 Photos appear to show a plane wing and part of the fuselage in the Potomac River.Credit: Andrew Harnik/Getty Images pic.twitter.com/fKn8znVmQYâ MSNBC (@MSNBC) January 30, 2025 Audio between PAT25 and DCA tower asking if they have the CRJ in sight.

Ontario. The four crew members and seventy-six passengers survived, but eighteen people were injured, three of them seriously. Several videos captured the accident sequence. On touchdown, the right hand main gear collapsed, causing a fire and the right wing to contact the ground.

The left wing and nose gear remained attached to the airframe.
