There were 126 passengers and eight crew members on board. The airplane operated on a flight KGL348 from Surgut Airport (SGC) to Moskva-Domodedovo Airport (DME). Three passengers died and about 32 were seriously injured. The airplane was destroyed by fire. Initial reports indicate that the airplane had been towed to the main taxiway for engine startup. A short circuit occurred while the AC generators were connected to the aircraft's electrical system after start-up of the engines. A fire erupted in the rear, spreading quickly through the main cabin. The crew shut down the engines and initiated an evacuation.  The Interstate Aviation Committee reported that engines no. 1, 2 and 3 and the APU were not the source of the fire. The fire started in the rear of the aircraft in the area of frames 62-65. The cause of the fire was an electrical arc produced by electrical currents exceeding ten to twenty times the nominal loads when two generators not synchronised with each other were brought online but got connected together instead of being connected to parallel busses. The unsynchronised operation of the generators can be attributed to: - Poor technical conditions of contacts TKS233DOD responsible for connecting the generators with the electrical busses, that were damaged by prolonged operation without maintenance. A contact normally open was welded and fractured insulation material moved between contacts that are normally closed. These abnormal contact positions led to the connection between #2 and #3 generators. - Differences in the schematic diagrams of generator 2 and generators 1 and 3. When the switch is moved from ""check"" to ""enable"" with no delay in the ""neutral"" position generator 2 is brought online without time delay which leads to increased wear of normally closed contacts in the TKS233DOD unit. - The specific design of the electrical systems to ensure power supply to each bus from either the APU or either engine integrated drive generator.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: At least one dead, three missing in plane explosion in Siberia (Update 3) (RIA)  MAK Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC)  Russian Ministry of Health statement  Russian Ministry of Transport statement   Location  Images: photo (c) MAK; Surgut Airport (SGC); January 2011 photo (c) MAK; Surgut Airport (SGC); January 2011 photo (c) andy@g4sp.co.uk; Moskva-Domodedovo Airport (DME/UUDD); 28 July 2008 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

No injuries occurred during the event. The flight landed uneventfully at Toronto-Lester Pearson International Airport, Canada, where damage to the tail skid was discovered. Further damage to the aft pressure bulkhead was later discovered, and this damage was determined to be substantial. According to the captain, normal procedures were followed during preflight and taxi, including verification of the takeoff bug speeds. During the takeoff roll, the automatic, aircraft-generated V1 callout occurred and he began to rotate the airplane. The first officer did not call for rotation at that time. The captain applied nose up pitch command until he realized the indicated airspeed was too low. He said he then eased the nose of the airplane back down to the runway and re-rotated at the normal rotation speed, achieving approximately 10 degrees nose up at about 155 to 160 knots. The FO said he noticed that the automatic voice callout occurred about 20 knots early and observed the captain rotate for takeoff, but he said nothing to the captain for fear of causing confusion. The rest of the climbout, cruise, descent, and landing at Toronto was uneventful. According to the first officer, during preflight preparations, due to a last minute runway change, the takeoff data V speeds did not automatically upload into the flight management computer (FMC), so he manually entered the speeds using information on the preflight paperwork. Flight planning data indicated that the airplane takeoff weight was 161,037 pounds with a center of gravity at 22.5% mean aerodynamic chord, which under the conditions at the time of the accident should have resulted in a flaps 1 takeoff with V1 (takeoff decision speed) of 153 knots, a Vr (rotation speed) also of 153 knots, and V2 (scheduled takeoff speed) of 158 knots. The recorded data indicates the manually entered V speeds in the FMC were V1 123 knots, Vr 153 knots and V2 158 knots. Probable cause: The early rotation of the airplane to an angle at which the fuselage contacted the runway.  Contributing to early rotation was the CaptainÂs reaction to the erroneous V1 automated callout, likely assuming that the airplane was at or close to the correct Vr at the same time.  The erroneous automated callout was likely due to a keystroke entry error by the FO when manually entering takeoff data for a newly assigned departure runway.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA11FA050 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Flight IR277 took off from Tehran-Mehrabad Airport at 18:33 local time (15:03 UTC) and continued its route via UL125 and G781 towards Urmia. At 15:37 UTC, after coordinating with Tehran Control Center for an approach to Urmia Airport, the aircraft began to descend and at 15:42 UTC contacted the Urmia Tower and was cleared for the TUBAR2A procedure and a VOR/DME/ILS approach to runway 21.  Weather at the airport was poor with a visibility of about 800 m in heavy snow. During the execution of the approach procedure to land at Urmia Airport, the aircraft's stick shaker (stall warning) was activated due to the low speed in relation to the flap settings. The problem was resolved after corrective action was taken. At 15:54:49 UTC, the Urmia Tower controller requested the position of flight IR277 three times. Then, the flight reported its position as being 5 miles away. The Urmia Tower controller then inquired if the aircraft was established on the ILS, to which the flight responded negatively. The Urmia Tower controller then asked the flight if it intended to continue its approach for landing. In response, flight IR277 reported that it had abandoned the approach and was performing a missed approach. The controller then requested that the flight rejoin the IAF (Initial Approach Fix) for runway 21, and flight IR277 confirmed this. After the missed approach at 16:00:41 UTC, despite being at an altitude of 8,768 feet, with a pitch-up angle of 8.1 degrees and a left bank angle of 26 degrees, the aircraft, with a speed of 170 knots (within the operational limit) and flaps set at 50 degrees, experienced a second stick shaker activation and a decrease in altitude, indicating the aircraft was approaching the stall speed threshold. This possibly occurred due to a aerodynamic change in the aircraft, potentially due to ice formation on parts of the aircraft, such as the tail section, which lacks an anti-ice system, which led to an increase in stall speed.  The engine pressure ratio (EPR) of all three engines increased from (1.30 - 1.25 - 1.36) to (1.46 - 1.48 - 1.53) and then decreased over four seconds to (1.05 - 1.07 - 1.06). This could have been caused by disturbed airflow entering the engines, combined with the increase in bank angle from 26 to 40 degrees to the left, likely due to the stall. To recover from the stall, at 16:00:50 UTC, the pilot instructed for maximum power to be applied to all three engines. Initially, engine 3 reached an EPR of 2.14 at 16:00:53 UTC. However, due to disturbed airflow entering the engine, the EPR dropped, leading to engine failure. Five seconds later, engine 1 also failed in a similar manner. At 16:00:53 UTC, the Urmia Tower controller asked for the position of flight IR277 again. The flight responded with ""Standby."" The tower controller then asked for the flight's intentions, and the response was that they were abandoning the approach. Due to intermittent radio communication, the tower controller requested a repetition of the last transmission. Flight IR277 then stated, ""We are going to Tehran."" At 16:01:07 UTC, the pilot ordered maximum engine power. Only engine 2 responded, reaching an EPR of 2.11. The flaps were then retracted, leading to a quicker loss of altitude. At 16:01:08 UTC, in a radial of 150 degrees from the VOR and at a distance of 30 kilometers from the airport, near the villages of Meshkabad Olya and Hasanlu, the aircraft impacted terrain and broke up. Main Cause of the Accident: The main cause of the accident was the unfavorable and abnormal conditions experienced by the aircraft, combined with inadequate handling by the cockpit crew in response to the emerging situation. Contributing Factors: - The outdated technology of the aircraft's systems. - The lack of a suitable simulator for adverse weather conditions. - Failure to properly follow operational procedures by the flight crew. - Inadequate cockpit management (CRM).

Reverse thrust was selected immediately after touchdown, but the aircraft subsequently bounced and the commander decided to go-around.  During the go-around the No 2 (right) engine thrust reverser failed to stow, and the engine thrust was maintained at idle by the FADEC system. The aircraftâs tail struck the ground during the rotation. The aircraft became airborne at low speed in a high drag configuration and its acceleration and climb performance did not increase appreciably until 47 seconds after lift off.  The No 2 engine was subsequently shut down and the aircraft diverted to Stansted Airport, where a single engine landing was carried out. The No 1 thrust reverser was selected during the landing at Stansted, but did not fully deploy. The investigation found that the most likely reason for the No 2 thrust reverser failure to stow was an intermittent loose connection in the auto-restow circuit. It was further determined that conflicting operational guidance exists with respect to selection of reverse thrust and go-around procedures. A number of safety actions have been taken as a result of this serious incident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: EW/C2011/01/03 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: http://avherald.com/h?article=43691dea/0000&opt=0  http://www.aaib.gov.uk/cms_resources.cfm?file=/Airbus%20A300-B4-622R%20TF-ELK%2005-12.pdf  https://www.planespotters.net/Production_List/Airbus/A300/557,TF-ELK-TNT-Airways.php Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates10-May-2012 12:52 ryan Added 14-Oct-2012 17:35 Dr. John Smith Updated [Aircraft type, Cn, Source, Embed code, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

There were no fatalities. The airplane operated on a flight from Hoedspruit Airport (HDS) to Johannesburg-O.R. Tambo International Airport (JNB). Whilst taxiing to the cleared holding point for takeoff from runway 18, the pilot switched off the landing lights to avoid blinding an approaching aircraft. As a result, he overshot the turning point at taxiway C in the darkness and found himself at the end of taxiway A with insufficient space to turn around. According to him, he decided to maneuvre the aircraft out of the ""dead end"" by turning into the last taxiway, which led to military hangars, and then reversing the aircraft to carry out a 180Â° turn. This was to be done without external guidance. Whilst reversing the aircraft, the pilot failed to stop it in time, the main wheels rolled off the edge of the taxiway and the aircraft slipped down a steep embankment, coming to rest with the nose-wheel still on the taxiway.

This resulted in an altitude deviation of minus 400 feet to plus 400 feet from the assigned altitude of 35 000 feet above sea level. Fourteen passengers and 2 flight attendants were injured. The seatbelt sign had been selected âonâ approximately 40 minutes prior to the pitch excursion. The flight continued to destination whereupon 7 passengers were sent to hospital and were later released. Findings as to Causes and Contributing Factors 1. The interrupted sleep obtained by the first officer prior to the flight increased the likelihood that rest would be needed during the overnight eastbound flight. 2. The first officer slept for approximately 75 minutes which likely placed the first officer into slow-wave sleep and induced longer and more severe sleep inertia. 3. The first officer was experiencing a circadian low due to the time of day and fatigue due to interrupted sleep which increased the propensity for sleep and subsequently worsened the sleep inertia. 4. By identifying the oncoming aircraft, the captain engaged the first officer (FO) before the effects of sleep inertia had worn off. 5. Under the effects of sleep inertia, the first officer perceived the oncoming aircraft to be on a collision course and pushed forward on the control column. 6. The frequency of training and depth of the training material on fatigue risk management to which the flight crew were exposed were such that the risks associated with fatigue were not adequately understood and procedures for conducting controlled rest were not followed by the flight crew. 7. Although the seatbelt sign was on and an announcement about potential turbulence was made, several passengers were injured during the event because they were not wearing their seatbelt.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A11F0012 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: http://web.archive.org/web/20110118070027/http://www.cbc.ca:80/canada/story/2011/01/14/air-canada-turbulence-switzerland.html?  https://www.blick.ch/news/schweiz/kinder-und-eine-schwangere-betroffen-flug-mit-14-verletzten-in-zuerich-gelandet-id67269.html  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates15-Jan-2011 02:28 peterj Added 15-Jan-2011 04:59 harro Updated [Aircraft type, Registration, Cn, Location, Country, Source, Damage, ]24-Dec-2023 19:02 harro Updated [Other fatalities, Location, Country, Narrative, Category, Accident report, ]24-Dec-2023 19:03 harro Updated [Other fatalities, Departure airport, Destination airport, Category, ]27-Apr-2024 13:28 ASN Updated Corrections or additions? ...

The pilot and five passengers were fatally injured. The flight originated at BrasÃ­lia-Presidente Juscelino Kubitschek International Airport, DF (BSB). During a VOR approach to runway 32 in heavy rain, the airplane impacted Santo AntÃ´nio Hill, 11 km short of the runway. Contributing Factors (translated from Portuguese) - Obesity - undetermined Factors such as obesity and sedentary lifestyle, associated with the high workload in the moments before the collision with the hill, may have contributed to the fact that the task requirement in the final approach exceeded safety margins, leading to a wrong decision of the pilot. - Attitude - unspecified In facing adverse weather conditions and knowing that previous landing aircraft had better visibility at altitude below 3,500 feet in the final approach of the VOR procedure, the pilot may have raised the level of confidence in the situation to the point of continuing descent without considering the risk involved. - Emotional state - undetermined The conditions that were present in the final phase of the flight may have raised the level of tension in the cabin to the point of compromising the management of the situation by the pilot, who left the task of communicating to the passenger. - Decision-making process When considering that the pilot decided to descend from the minimum altitude to achieve visual conditions, it can be assumed that his decision, probably influenced by the experiences of previous aircraft, was made without adequately assessing the risks involved and without considering the option of flying IFR, taking in view of local weather. In addition, the pilot's decision-making process may have been compromised by the lack of information about the Morro de Santo AntÃ´nio in the approach letter - publication of aid for the pilot in flight. - Adverse weather conditions - contributed The images provided by the primary radar of the AnÃ¡polis Control (APP-AN) indicated the existence of strong cloudiness associated with heavy formations in the final approach of the VOR procedure. These conditions influenced the occurrence, causing the collision of the aircraft against the Morro de Santo AntÃ´nio, independently of the hypotheses raised in the investigation. - Navigation deviation - contributed The final approach on course 320 Â° (instead of the expected 325 Â°) led the aircraft to line up with the hill where the collision occurred. - ATS Publication - undefined Morro de Santo AntÃ´nio, an obstacle to control the final approach in which the aircraft collision occurred, was not identified in the VOR approach letter for lane 32, as anticipated by CIRTRAF 100-30, a fact that may have contributed to a possible reduction of situational awareness.METAR: 19:42 UTC /  local time: SBGO 141942Z 23007KT 1000 SHRA SCT013 BKN020 BKN080 25/22 Q1012 =20:00 UTC /  local time: SBGO 142000Z 20005KT 1600 -SHRA SCT010 BKN020 FEW030TCU BKN080 23/22 Q1012 =20:10 UTC /  local time: SBGO 142010Z 35002KT 4000 -TSRA FEW010 SCT030 FEW040CB BKN100 23/22 Q1013=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CENIPA Report number: A-606/CENIPA/2014 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 years and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  O Hoje 16-1-2011   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

King Airport (STT), Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands. The flight was cleared for takeoff from runway 28 at Saint Thomas Airport at 07:47 hours local time. At 07:48:44, the local controller advised the flightcrew, ""Convair seven seven quebec observe a lot of smoke coming from your left engine are you in need of any assistance sir"", to which the captain (pilot not flying) stated, ""ah no we are fine..."" The captain attributed the smoke trailing from the left engine to the age of the airplane.  The crew then switched frequencies to San Juan Combined En Route Approach Control (San Juan CERAP). Upon receiving a message from the local controller at Saint Thomas, CERAP reported to the flight crew that flames were now observed on the left hand engine. After being notified of the fire, the co-pilot reported they checked the engine instruments and did not have any indication of a fire. About that time the owner of the company who was airborne in another airplane told them they needed to return. The captain ordered the co-pilot to go into the cabin to visually look at the left engine and after returning to the cockpit informed the captain there was a fire. The captain advised that he executed the procedures for fire checklist and secured the left engine but the fire continued. The flight returned for landing at Saint Thomas, and at 07:50:50, the pilot of a company airplane reported, ""...you definitely have a fire going."" The flight continued towards Saint Thomas and ATC communications were transferred to STT ATCT. At 07:53:21, the flight was cleared to land. The captain later reported that while returning to Saint Thomas, he noticed an issue with the left aileron which the co-pilot assisted with. The airplane was landed on runway centerline at 90 knots, but the flightcrew were unable to stop the airplane. The captain also reported that there was no steering, the brakes were not working properly. During the landing roll the airport fire rescue vehicles followed the airplane while attempting to extinguish the fire and avoiding debris that was separating from the airplane. The airplane departed the right side of the runway, crossed a taxiway and a perimeter road, then went through the airport perimeter fence and came to rest upright with the nose section over a public road outside of the airport property. After the airplane came to rest, the flightcrew exited the airplane from the overwing exits, and the fire rescue vehicles converged on the airplane and extinguished the fire. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The captainÂs decision to continue the flight with the left engine backfiring, resulting in an engine fire shortly after takeoff.

Prior to departure the crew did not remove accumulated snow on the upper surface of the wing. Relevant Events and Factors: a. Contaminated ice and snow on tail section most likely cause sluggish rotation during the takeoff; this will result in over rotation, over rotation result in wing stall. b. Contamination of snow and ice on the wing, fuselage and tail will compromise the normal takeoff characteristics. c. With snow and ice and combination of disruptive air flow, heavier actual weights and over rotation, the combinations most likely not activate any stall warning safety design.

Descending through 34,668 feet, the tailwind suddenly decreased and the indicated speed of the airplane quickly increased. The captain activated the speed brakes and disengaged the autopilot. Subsequently, the airplane began to slow. As the captain was slowly retarding the speed brakes, the airplane started to climb and the captain slowly lowered the nose of the airplane. The digital flight data recorder revealed that over a 30-second period the airplane's vertical acceleration decreased to 0.75 g, then increased to 2.33 g, decreased to 0.05 g, then stabilized at 0.9 g (normal). During the event, one passenger broke her femur; two cabin attendants and four passengers received minor injuries. The airplane was not damaged.  Convective activity was located immediately west of where the event occurred, likely blocking the wind flow and causing a wave-like disturbance downstream of the storms, which would result in unanticipated convectively induced turbulence. Since the event occurred in clear air downstream of the cumulonimbus clouds, the airplane likely encountered an undulating turbulence under a strong temperature inversion and strong windshear. The turbulence was not predicted by weather forecasters.

There were 10 passengers and two crew members on board. Both crew members and four passengers were killed.  The airplane operated on Manx2 flight NM7100 from Belfast City Airport (BHD) to Cork Airport (ORK). Following a fuel uplift a total fuel quantity of 3000 lb (1360 kg) was recorded, which was sufficient for the planned round trip to Cork and back to Belfast. The flight plan specified Waterford Airport (EIWF) as the alternate for the sector to Cork. The accident flight took off from Belfast at 08:10 hrs, and climbed to Flight Level (FL) 120. The co-pilot was Pilot Flying (PF) with the commander acting as Pilot Non Flying (PNF).  At 08:48 the flight contacted Cork Approach Control. The Cork ATIS information stated that runway 35 was the active runway with Low Visibility Procedures (LVP) in operation. Cork Approach also informed the flight crew that runway 35 was the active runway with CAT II available for runway 17. The RVRs on runway 17 were passed by Cork Approach as 300 m (touchdown), 350 m (midpoint) and 550 m (stop-end) (300/350/550). Flight 7100 was given the choice of runways, and while runway 35 was initially considered by the flight crew, a decision was made to opt for an approach to runway 17. This was acknowledged by Cork Approach who stated ""...thatÂs copied, just check IRVRs Runway 17 for CAT II, currently at 350, 350, and 450.""  The aircraft first established on the ILS approach to runway 17 at 08:58 and was handed over to Cork Tower. The RVRs passed by Cork Tower at 09:00 hrs were 300/400/375. The approach was continued beyond the 3.5 nautical miles (nm) DME point (outer marker equivalent). A missed approach was carried out at 09:03 hrs, the lowest height recorded on this approach was 101 ft radio altitude. A second ILS approach was then flown, to the reciprocal direction runway 35, with the aircraft being handed over to Cork Tower at 09.10 at 8 nm from touchdown. At 09:10:56 the flight crew reported established on the ILS runway 35. The RVRs passed by the Tower at this time were 350/350/350. Descent was continued beyond the 4.9 nm DME point (outer marker equivalent). A missed approach was carried out at 09:14, the lowest height recorded on this approach was 91 ft radio altitude. At 09:15 hrs the flight crew requested to enter a holding pattern for 15 to 20 minutes to see if the weather would improve. The flight took up the holding pattern at point ROVAL maintaining an altitude of 3,000 ft. The flight crew requested the weather for Waterford. This weather, which was below minima, was provided by Cork Approach. The flight crew nominated Shannon Airport as their second alternate and requested weather information. Shannon weather was passed by Cork Approach, it was below minima. Weather for Dublin Airport was then sought by the flight crew. This was acknowledged by Cork Approach who offered to provide the weather for Kerry Airport also. The weather at Kerry was passed with the visibility being reported as greater than 10 kilometres. Weather conditions at Dublin, which were marginal, were obtained and passed to the flight crew at 09:35 hrs. At approximately 09:32 hrs, with EC-ITP still in the ROVAL hold, the RVR values on runway 17 at Cork began to improve. Following a further improvement to 500/450/400 at 09:39 hrs, the flight crew elected to attempt another approach to runway 17.  At 09:45 the aircraft reported established on the ILS, and was configured with landing gear down and 1/2 flaps selected. At 09:45:26, when EC-ITP was at 11 nm DME on the ILS, the RVR (touchdown) improved to 550 m, which was passed to the flight crew by Cork Approach. At 09:45:38, the flight was handed over to the Cork Tower and the flight crew reported to the Tower at 09:46:00 passing 9 nm DME. The final RVRs passed to EC-ITP at 09.46:15 were 500/400/400 when the aircraft was 9.6 nm from the threshold of runway 17. At approximately 400 ft radio altitude, recorded data shows the aircraft deviated to the right of the runway centreline, paralleling the centreline track. The descent was continued below Decision Height (DH). Power was reduced momentarily before being re-applied. Just below 100 ft radio altitude, a go-around was called by the PNF and was acknowledged by the PF.  Recorded data shows that the aircraft rolled significantly to the left as the aircraft tracked towards the runway centreline. This was immediately followed by a rapid roll to the right which brought the right wingtip into contact with the runway surface. Runway surface contact was made with a roll angle of 97 degrees to the right. The initial impact mark was located 86 m from the runway threshold, and 2 m left of the centreline.  The aircraft continued to roll rapidly to the right and struck the runway in the fully inverted position 25 m beyond the initial impact point. The inverted aircraft departed the runway surface on a heading of approximately 195Â° M and came to a rest 189 m from the initial impact point. The propeller blades on both engines were severely damaged; three of the four propeller blades on the right-hand engine detached during the inverted impact. Fire occurred in both engines post impact.  The AOC of the operator contained approval for the aircraft to operate CAT I approaches only. In this case a decision height of 200 feet at an RVR (touchdown) minimum of 550 m for runway 17 and 750 m for runway 35. The Investigation determined that the probable cause was ÂLoss of control during an attempted go-around initiated below Decision Height (200 feet) in Instrument Meteorological ConditionsÂ. The Investigation identified the following factors as being significant: - The approach was continued in conditions of poor visibility below those required. - The descent was continued below the Decision Height without adequate visual reference being acquired. - Uncoordinated operation of the flight and engine controls when go-around was attempted - The engine power-levers were retarded below the normal in-flight operational range, an action prohibited in flight. - A power difference between the engines became significant when the engine power levers were retarded below the normal in-flight range. - Tiredness and fatigue on the part of the Flight Crew members. - Inadequate command training and checking. - Inappropriate pairing of Flight Crew members, and - Inadequate oversight of the remote Operation by the Operator and the State of the Operator.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIU Report number: 2014-001 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) statement  Six killed as passenger plane crashes in fog at Cork airport (Irish Times, 10-2-2011)  Irish Examiner  SKYbraryÂ  History of this aircraft N3003T Fairchild Aircraft (registered, Oct 1991) XA-SES AÃ©romexico (delivered, Sep 1992) XA-SES Aerolitoral (leased, Sep 1992) ZS-PDW Norse Air Charter (Sep. 2003) EC-ITP Top Fly (registered, 22 Jan 2004) EC-ITP Top Fly (incident at Palma de Mallorcawhen it ran off the runway, 21 May 2004 ) EC-ITP LÃ­neas AÃ©reas de AndalucÃ­a (op. by Euro Continental Air, May 2008) EC-ITP Manx2 (leased, May 2008) EC-ITP Ibertour Servicios AÃ©reos (leased, Nov. 2009) EC-ITP Manx2 (leased, 2011) Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  21 May 2004 EC-ITP Top Fly 0 Palma de Mallorca Airport (PMI/LEPA) min Location  Images: photo (c) anon.; Cork Airport (ORK/EICK); 10 February 2011 photo (c) anon.; Cork Airport (ORK/EICK); 10 February 2011 photo (c) anon.; Cork Airport (ORK/EICK); 10 February 2011 photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Lanzarote Airport (ACE/GCRR); January 2007 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates17-Aug-2024 19:25 ASN Updated The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane incurred substantial left wing damage when the left main landing gear collapsed during the overrun.  The purpose of the flight was a test flight following the installation of the airplane's interior prior to delivery of the airplane to its owner. The flight departed from Appleton about 10:10. The flight returned about three hours later. While the airplane was inside the final approach fix, an amber left side hydraulic quantity low crew alerting system (CAS) message illuminated. The pilot flying (PF) noticed the hydraulic fluid quantity decreasing. Subsequently, an amber left hydraulic system fail CAS message appeared. The pilot not flying (PNF) pulled out the checklist to accomplish the left hydraulic system failure procedures and then suggested a go-around because the landing runway was about 500 feet shorter than the recommended minimum runway length indicated in the checklist. The PF decided to land due to the hydraulic quantity indications, prior autopilot problems, and the airplane's landing configuration. The PNF turned on the auxiliary pump about 500 feet above ground level, and both the PF and PNF thought the auxiliary hydraulic system could support normal spoilers, brakes, and nosewheel steering. The PF selected right thrust reverser aft and began pressing the brakes, but he felt no braking action. He reached for the emergency brakes; however, he did not immediately apply them to slow the airplane because he decided that there was not enough distance remaining to stop the airplane on the runway. Therefore, he attempted to go around with insufficient runway remaining by advancing the throttles to the maximum continuous thrust setting. The PNF did not see the airspeed increase and believed that not enough runway remained to get airborne, so he pulled the throttles back to avoid a runway overrun. The airplane exited the runway and sustained substantial damage. A review of the cockpit voice recorder transcript indicated that, before the emergency, the flight crew did not maintain a disciplined cockpit environment that focused on operationally relevant discussion but instead repeatedly made reference to and discussed objects on the ground and other operationally irrelevant topics. The lack of a sterile cockpit did not promote crew coordination and communication and adherence to procedures, which would have helped mitigate this emergency. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The pilot flying's (PF) decision to land on a shorter-than-recommended runway with a known left hydraulic system failure rather than go around as suggested by the pilot-not-flying, his failure to immediately apply emergency brakes following the detection of the lack of normal brakes, and his attempt to go around late in the landing roll with insufficient runway remaining. Contributing to the accident was the nose landing gear swivel assembly failure, the lack of a hydraulic fuse before this critical failure point, and the design of the swivel using two similar alloys with a propensity to adhere to each other when rubbed together. Also contributing to the accident was the lack of a disciplined cockpit environment.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN11FA193 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) Holm; Stockholm-Arlanda Airport (ARN/ESSA); 13 June 2017 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All 12 passengers and two crew members on board were killed. The airplane operated on Central American Airways flight 731 from San Pedro Sula (SAP) to Tegucigalpa (TGU). The flight had departed San Pedro Sula at 07:04 for the forty minute flight to Tegucigalpa. The pilot flying deviated from the airways without clearance from air traffic control. At 07:34 the controller at Toncontin Airport cleared the flight direct to the 15 DME fix (final approach fix) for a VOR/DME approach to runway 20 and to descend to 9000 feet. At 07:51 the fight reported that they were performing a missed approach, after which the flight was cleared for a VOR/DME approach to runway 02. The airplane was lined up with runway 02 and descending with full flaps, when at about 12 km from the runway the airplane stalled. The descent could not be arrested and the airplane impacted a wooded hillside at an elevation of 5412 ft. PROBABLE CAUSES (translated from original Spanish language report):  1) Weather conditions existing at the time of the event, during the approach to the runway the aircraft was operated slightly above the stall speed and a major change in wind speed could cause a stall. The altitude at which the windshear occured, and the reaction time of the pilot and the responsiveness of the aircraft determined whether the descent could be arrested in time to avoid an accident.  2) No published descent procedures were performed, possibly misinterpretation of Flight Instruments (altimeter, airspeed indicator).  3) During the descent to the VOR/DME for runway 20 and 02, the pilot in command (PIC) did not check his approach chart, and did not continually consult the first officer on the altitude and course.  4) There was no adequate communication between crew; deficient CRM (No approach briefing was made for any of the two approaches).  5) The aircraft was configured for landing with flaps fully down (flap 42) at a very long distance from the track without having it in sight. It is noteworthy that the aircraft will not respond to an adverse condition windshear as it appeared at that time with such a configuration. It should be noted that in both approaches it is mandatory to perdorm a ""circuling"" procedure.METAR: 14:00 UTC / 08:00 local time: MHTG 141400Z 36009KT 5000 VCSH FEW007 BKN020 17/14 Q1022 A3018 NOSIG=Wind 360 degrees at 9 knots; Visibility 5000m; Showers in the vicinity; Few clouds 700 ft., broken clouds 2,000 ft.; Temperature 17Â°C; Dew point 14Â°C; 1022 hPaAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIAA Honduras Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: El Tiempo  La Tribuna  Confirmado: Catorce personas fallecieron en accidente de aviaciÃ³n en Las Mesitas (Proceso, 14-2-2011)   Location  Images: photo (c) Nelson Mejia; San Pedro Sula-Ramon Villeda Morales Airport (SAP/MHLM); 31 August 2010 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane operated on a flight from Grenchen Airport. Destination of the ferry flight was Newquay-Cornwall Airport (NQY) in England. The co-pilot was pilot flying (PF) and the commander was pilot not flying (PNF). HB-VOV left stand ""white alpha"" at 08:48 LT. The crew had previously received the necessary clearance to take off from runway 07 after a request to Grenchen aerodrome control (tower). The de-icing system was switched on from the outset in view of the prevailing conditions. The taxi checklist was completed on the short route to the runway 07 holding position via taxiway WHISKEY. This included, among other things, testing the functionality of the brakes, which was carried out by both crew members. No anomalies were found. At approximately the same time, the Grenchen aerodrome control air traffic control officer (ATCO) arranged for a runway inspection, as visibility did not allow a view from the tower to the end of runway 07.  After receiving clearance at 08:51 LT, the commander steered the aircraft onto runway 07 and initially turned west, in order to have the maximum runway length available for the subsequent takeoff (backtrack). After a further 180 degree clockwise turn, HB-VOV was positioned just north of the runway centerline, pointing to the east. To take advantage of the available runway length, the commander, according to his own statements, did not manoeuvre the aircraft precisely onto the runway centerline. Runway 07 has a takeoff run available (TORA) of 3281 ft (1000 m). The ATCO observed HB-VOV taxiing onto the runway and instructed the crew to hold on the runway, as a runway inspection was still in progress. In view of the expected delay, the commander then set the parking brake. At 08:53:43 LT, the crew of HB-VOV received takeoff clearance: ""Hotel Oscar Victor, wind zero six zero degrees six knots, runway zero seven, cleared for takeoff"". The commander then switched on the pitot heater and landing lights, pushed the thrust levers forward and handed control over to the copilot. He instructed the copilot, in view of the reduced visibility, to carry out a so-called standing takeoff. At a power setting with a low-pressure compressor speed N1 of approximately 90% of the rated speed the copilot took his feet off the brake pedals, set takeoff thrust and steered the aircraft on the runway centerline. The set takeoff thrust was checked by both crew members. The ATCO watched the HB-VOV takeoff roll and noticed slower acceleration than usual.  After checking the takeoff thrust and the speed indications at the beginning of the takeoff roll, the commander had the impression that the aircraft's acceleration was lower than usual. HB-VOV attained a speed of 80 kt before taxiway ECHO 1, i.e. rather late, but still within a framework which seemed acceptable to the commander. On reaching rotation speed (VR), in the co-pilot's estimation approximately 250 m before the end of the runway, the commander called out ""rotate"", whereupon the copilot pulled on the control column. Both crew members immediately noticed that the nose of the aircraft was not lifting. After a repeated callout by the commander, he too pulled on the control column. On overshooting the end of the runway, the right main landing gear of HB-VOV struck a ""end-of-runway"" light, which was perceived by the crew as a distinctly noticeable impact. On the transition from the runway to the grass, the copilot, according to his statement, had the feeling that it was no longer possible to continue the takeoff and briefly reduced power. But at approximately the same time, the copilot noted that HB-VOV had already lifted off and applied full power again. At the same time, he asked the commander whether the takeoff process should continue. The latter answered the copilot's question in the affirmative, with the consideration that they would perhaps still have a chance to get the aircraft into the air. The events from overshooting the end of the runway to lift-off of HB-VOV, after a roll of more than 100 metres in the adjacent meadow, occurred within a few seconds. In the process the aircraft crossed a small stream bed running perpendicular to the runway. Once the aircraft had attained the normal attitude for a climb at the appropriate takeoff safety speed V2, the commander reduced power to maximum continuous thrust (MCT) and retracted the flaps. Then the crew realised that the parking brake was still set. The commander retracted the landing gear and detected that the red warning light did not go out. He instructed the copilot to keep the speed low and extended the gear again. All three landing gear indicators indicated green. At an altitude of approximately 3500 ft AMSL, HB-VOV was transferred to Berne arrival air traffic control. As part of the climb check, the de-icing system was switched off again. The crew subsequently decided to make an alternate landing at Zurich airport. The crew did not declare an emergency and did not apply for landing priority. According to the landing gear indicators in the cockpit, the crew assumed that the landing gear was extended and locked. For this reason they did not make a low pass at Zurich airport for an external visual check of the landing gear. After the approach and landing, HB-VOV exited runway 14 at the end via taxiway HOTEL 3. The crew then waived a visual check and taxied the aircraft directly to the stand on the apron near the General Aviation Centre (GAC). As a result of the collision of the right main landing gear of HB-VOV with the endof-runway light and the subsequent crossing of the stream bed, structural damage was found in the area of the nose gear and main gear, as well as to both rear wing spars. Also, a certain asymmetry was ascertained in the dimensions of the aircraft. The two pilots were uninjured in the accident. CAUSES: The accident is attributable to a collision with obstacles beyond the end of the runway, because the aircraft did not achieve the expected acceleration during the take-off roll and because the take-off roll was nevertheless continued. The following causal factors were identified: - reduced acceleration of the aircraft during take-off because of the set parking brake. - the missing decision of the crew to respond to the reduced acceleration by aborting the take-off. The fact that the aircraft had no warning device to indicate a set parking brake when the take-off roll is initiated contributed to the accident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: SUST Report number: Nr. 2156 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

In examinations of the external surface of the pin, in a region close to the fatigue fracture, cracks were observed that had initiated from scratches created by an inadequate maintenance machining process. In the region where the overload-related fracture occurred, it was also possible to identify that the machining process had modified the profile of the part in the section transition region, by producing a depression. Thus, it can be said that the AFT PIVOT PIN (D61000 and SN 25) of the PR-TTI left main gear broke on account of fatigue, whose onset was facilitated by an inadequate machining process that had been performed in the section transition region of the pin. 3 Material Factor Not a contributor.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CENIPA Report number: A - 012/CENIPA/2013 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Pista de Aeroporto de Altamira segue parcialmente interditada (G1)  REGISTRO FOTOGRÃFICO DO ACIDENTE COM AVIÃO DA TRIP EM ALTAMIRA (SBHT)   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Due to the sudden movement of the airplane, the one remaining standing passenger and two of the flight attendants were thrown to the floor, one of whom sustained multiple bone fractures in her right foot. Probable Cause: The airplane's encounter with moderate turbulence at a higher altitude than the flight crew expected, resulting in an injury to a cabin crewmember.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: WPR11LA149 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB WPR11LA149 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  17 July 2023 N684DA Delta Air Lines 0 San Salvador/Ilopango International Airport (SAL/MSSS) min Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

None of the eleven occupants were injured. The airplane operated on scheduled flight M3990 from OLA (Ãrland) to OSL. During roll-out following a normal landing, when the aircraft's speed had decreased to less than 60 kt, the aircraft started an uncommanded turn to the right. The nose wheel steering system was activated. The course could not be corrected, and the aircraft veered off the side of the runway where it became stuck in hard-packed snow one meter deep. The investigation has shown that the loss of control was most likely caused by a fault in the nose wheel steering. The same problem had occurred six days earlier, but the commander then managed to disconnect the nose wheel steering in time and regained control. The fault could not be reproduced, and the aircraft was released to service after inspection and testing without remarks. The nose wheel steering system on this aircraft type is relatively complex, and over time several improvements have been made to improve its reliability. The Flight Manual has a caution related to activation of nose wheel steering at speeds higher than normal taxi speed. There was some freezing rain/freezing fog at the time of the accident. Comprehensive technical examination of the nose wheel steering on OY-NPB uncovered no single causal factor, but some indications of unsatisfactory maintenance. Irregularities that alone or in combination could have caused a temporary fault with the steering were present. The Accident Investigation Board believes that a temporary fault caused the nose wheel to unintentionally lock itself in a position towards the right. No other defects or irregularities that could explain why the aircraft veered off the runway were found.METAR: 02:41 UTC /  local time: 280241Z 19003KT 7000 FEW009 BKN025 M05/M06 Q1027Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIBN Report number: SL 2012/06 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: AIBN Norway   Location  Images: photo (c) AIBN; Oslo-Gardermoen Airport (OSL); 02 March 2011; (publicdomain) photo (c) Allan J.

The pilot applied maximum braking and reverse thrust, but could not stop the airplane before exiting the runway. The reported weather was visibility of 3/4 mile in mist and an indefinite ceiling at 200 feet. The operator reported that there was no mechanical malfunction or failure of the airplane that would have precluded normal operation. Both pilots were likely influenced by the mission pressure to land because of medical considerations for a passenger on board.

All 31 passengers and three crew members survived. The airplane operated on a flight from ReykjavÃ­k Domestic Airport (RKV), Iceland to GodthÃ¥b/Nuuk Airport (GOH), Greenland with an enroute stop at Kulusuk. At 12:58, the flight crew of TF-JMB made radio contact with Nuuk AFIS and were informed that the runway in use was 23. The weather was reported to be: wind direction from 170Â° at a speed of 24 kts with a maximum of 43 kts, the visibility was 4,000 meters in light snow, moderate blowing snow, a few clouds at 1,800 feet, broken clouds at 3,500 feet, the temperature was zero, the dew point was minus four Celsius and the QNH was 1014 hPa.  The flight crew made visual contact with the runway and decided to deviate to the right (west) of the offset Localizer (LLZ) to runway 23. The flight continued towards the runway from a position right of the runway centerline. The flight crew was aiming to land the aircraft at a point between the runway threshold and the touchdown zone.  As the aircraft approached runway 23 it was still in the final right turn over the landing threshold. The aircraft touched down on runway 23 between the runway threshold and the touchdown zone and to the left of the runway centerline. The Flight Data Recorder (FDR) data indicated that the aircraft was banking more than 11Â° to the right as the aircraft touched down. At the same time the vertical acceleration was approximately 3.9 G and the rate of descent was greater than 13 feet per second. The right main landing gear (MLG) shock strut fuse pin sheared and the right MLG collapsed, the aircraft skidded down the runway and departed the runway to the right. The nose landing gear was separated from the aircraft as the aircraft was entering the unpaved surface. The aircraft came to rest in the rocky area to the right of runway 23. Adverse wind and turbulence conditions at BGGH led to flight crew task saturation on final approach and a breakdown of optimum cockpit resource management (CRM) resulting in a divergence from the operatorÂs stabilized approach policy. The divergence from the operatorÂs stabilized approach policy caused an unstabilized approach and a hard landing leading to an excess load of the right MLG at touchdown.

The intended destination of the flight was Canouan (TVSC) in the Grenadine Islands but the pilot landed instead at Union Island (TVSU), some eight miles to the south of Canouan Island. In his report, the pilot stated that the ADF (Automatic Direction Finder) on board the aircraft was unserviceable and that they were navigating using the GPS and visual reference. On seeing Union Island, he assumed that it was Canouan and did not confirm this with the GPS distance. On seeing the high terrain to the west of the airport in Union Island the pilot decided to land from the east; hence his request to the Canouan ATC (STSC) to land on Runway 31. It was not until the aircraft was on short final approach that the pilots observed that the runway was 26 (the runway heading in Union Island (TVSU)) and not Runway 31 (the runway heading in Canouan TVSC)). The captain stated in his report that at this point, he did not believe that it was possible to execute a go-around due to the hills in his flight path. As a result of landing on the reduced runway length available at Union Island (TVSU), in addition to the tailwind component of approximately 10 kts, the aircraft was unable to stop and having veered off to the left, came to rest on the southern side of the end of Runway 26 striking the perimeter fence. CONCLUSIONS: Although the incorrect call sign (YV-192T instead of YV-196T) was consistently used by all of the Air Traffic Controllers, it does not appear to have contributed to the aircraft landing at the incorrect airport. The captain of the aircraft was not fluent in English and did not have an endorsement for English Language Proficiency on his licence. The Co-pilot had a level 4 endorsement. This lack of English Language Proficiency by the crew, particularly by the captain was, in the opinion of the investigators, a significant contributing factor in the aircraft landing at the wrong destination and therefore a major contributor to the accident. The Air Traffic Controller at Canouan (TVSC) issued landing clearance to the aircraft in spite of the fact that he did not observe the aircraft on when the pilot reported on final approach. The controller, in his report, stated that he found it strange that the pilot was requesting Runway 31 although the wind was favouring Runway 13. This coupled with the poor English Language Proficiency of the pilot should have caused him to be more vigilant prior to issuing landing clearance. The captain stated in his report that he did not observe the numbers on Runway 26 in Union Island until he was on short final. At that point, he decided that it was possible to execute a go- around due to the high terrain to the west of the runway and landed. The investigation revealed that the aircraftÂs performance was such that it could have executed a go-around up to the point of the threshold of Runway 26 in Union Island, by executing a turn to the south.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ECCAA Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: http://www.jeremietronet.com/unions-island-kiting-fishing-surfing-and-plane-crash/  https://whatsupcaribbean.wordpress.com/2011/03/06/plane-crash-in-union-islandupdated/  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The examination revealed that the right pedal assembly may interfere with the adjacent floorboard when the brake pedal is compressed to or near the full-internal cylinder travel stop, which may cause an additional stop and limit the overall travel of the cylinder. The examination also revealed that numerous components or items may prevent the master brake cylinders from fully extending after the brakes are released and adequate travel (reduced pressure) when the brakes are subsequently actuated. Additionally, the examination revealed that the brake fluid may bypass the piston O-ring or Stat-O-Seal if parts are damaged or excessively worn. The cylinder manufacturer, in conjunction with the FAA, published Service Bulletin CAB-32-01, Revision 1, to address the noted mechanical anomalies. Probable Cause: The malfunction of a master brake cylinder, which resulted in a loss of braking action and subsequent loss of directional control and collision with three vehicles during taxi. Contributing to the accident was the inappropriate design and manufacture of the master brake cylinders.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: WPR11FA158 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  FAA register:  2.

The commercial pilot, the sole occupant of the airplane, was not injured.  The pilot reported that following two attempts to land in crosswind conditions, he was cleared to land and was instructed by the air traffic control tower controller to follow another airplane on final approach. For spacing considerations, the controller instructed the pilot to conduct ""S"" turns behind the traffic landing ahead of him. As the airplane descended to an altitude of about 200 feet above ground level, the controller instructed the pilot to go around and maintain altitude. The pilot executed a go-around procedure, which included retracting the landing gear and reducing the flap setting to one-half flaps. Shortly after, the pilot was issued a clearance to land. The pilot proceeded with the landing clearance and subsequently landed with the gear in the retracted position, which resulted in structural damage to the airframe. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed no mechanical anomalies or failures with the landing gear or landing gear warning system. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot's failure to extend the landing gear, which resulted in a gear-up landing.

There were no injuries, and aircraft damage was limited to the nose and main landing gear, which was subsequently replaced. The flight departed Long Beach, CA (LGB) en route to Milan, Italy, with a planned fuel stop in Iqaluit (YFB), Canada. The flight time to Iqaluit was 5 hours and 36 minutes at a cruise altitude of 41 000 feet. The flight en route was uneventful; the outside temperature at the cruising altitude was approximately -60Â°C. The first officer was the pilot flying. An ILS/DME approach to runway 35 at Iqaluit was carried out with the autopilot on. The reported surface winds were within the aircraft limitations for a right crosswind with a light tailwind component. A reference speed (VREF) of 114 knots was calculated. The before-landing checklist items were completed 3 miles prior to the final approach fix. The autopilot was disconnected, and the aircraft crossed the threshold at a speed of about 118 knots. The aircraft touched down approximately 10 feet to the right of the centreline at 21:00. Once the nose wheel contacted the runway, the aircraft veered to the right. The crew applied full left rudder and left brake while selecting left nose steering with the tiller. Thrust reversers were also selected, but the aircraft continued to pull to the right. The aircraft departed the runway 4300 feet from the threshold and came to rest in packed snow 100 feet from the runway edge lights. The nose landing gear (NLG) came to rest in snow reaching the top of the wheel height, and the main landing gear (MLG) came to rest in snow reaching half the wheel height. Findings as to causes and contributing factors: 1. On touchdown, the nose wheel veered to the right, and the crewÂs attempt to control the uncommanded veer was not successful. 2. The electro hydraulic servo valve did not respond to steering commands, and the steering control unit logic commanded the steering selector valve to close. The steering selector valve did not close, and this condition prevented the nose-wheel steering system from free castering with the steering pointing to the right. 3. The electro hydraulic servo valve likely failed due to contamination, internal corrosion and exposure to cold temperatures. Findings as to risk: 1. If aircraft components have a lengthy time limit of operation without an accompanying periodic maintenance schedule, and component service history is not regularly reviewed, there is an increased risk of an unexpected component failure. 2. If cockpit voice recordings are not available to an investigation, this may preclude the identification and communication of safety deficiencies to advance transportation safety.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A11Q0052 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  16 October 2013 N818RC Tri Marine Logistics LLC 0 Biak-Frans Kaisiepo Airport (BIK/WABB) unk Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

During roll-out the aircraft collided with a de-icing truck parked on the runway, in front of the displaced threshold 08. Causes: The accident is attributable to the fact that a landing was carried out even though at that time a vehicle was still on the runway. This meant that the aircraft, in the course of its landing roll, collided with this vehicle. The following factors contributed to the accident: - The excessively high approach speed on final approach led to an increased landing distance. - The pilot had had little actual training on the aircraft type involved in the accident and in operation on short runways.

The captain was the pilot flying and the takeoff, climb and cruise portion of the flight was uneventful. Prior to landing, the captain conducted the approach briefing, indicating that they would conduct a visual approach to runway 26, the gusty winds required a wind additive to the approach speed and would go-around if the approach was not stabilized. On final approach, the local controller cleared the flight to land and reported the winds were 310 degrees at 16 knots. The flight crew stated that at 1000 feet AGL the landing checklist was complete, the airplane was fully configured for landing and the approach speed was set to 132 knots (Vref + 5).  Recorder data indicated that during the final approach, the autothrottle was disconnected about 800 feet above the ground and the airspeed decreased to as low as 129 knots but did not go below Vref (127 knots). The first officer (FO) stated that he called out the low airspeed and adjusted the target airspeed from 132 to 134 knots. The captain increased power during the approach but the airspeed remained slightly below Vapp until landing. Pitch attitude on final approach was stable at about 5 to 6 degrees nose up. The pitch attitude at touchdown was about 7 degrees and the airplane touched down first on the right main landing gear (MLG) and then on the left MLG. The flight crew stated that they felt that the airplane bounced and both called for a go around simultaneously. About one second after the initial touchdown, the ground spoilers began to deploy, followed by an increase in pitch in the next two seconds from 4.2 degrees to 12.7 degrees. Thrust levers advanced to near maximum thrust about one second after the left MLG touched down and as the ground spoilers were in transit. Pitch attitude continued to increase to more than 14 degrees while the airplane was still on the ground. Neither flight crewmember was aware of a tail strike until the captain discovered damage to the airplane during the post flight inspection. The tail strike resulted in aft fuselage skin cracks and numerous sheared rivets, internal structural damage to the frames, a cracked support bracket, buckled floor beam, buckled main cargo deck floor panels, and buckled stringers.

The captain, first officer, and sole passenger were not injured.  The captain was the pilot-flying during the accident flight. After departure, the flight had to circumnavigate around numerous thunderstorms that affected the planned route of flight. When the flight was within 25 nautical miles (nm) of its intended destination, the flight crew cancelled the instrument flight plan and concluded the flight under visual flight rules.  The captain noted the wind was from 310 degrees at 19 knots, gusting 27 knots. A 5 nm straight-in final approach was flown to runway 36 (5,500 feet by 100 feet). The captain reported that the landing reference speed (Vref) was 110 knots, which included a 5 knot gust factor. As the airplane touched down on its main landing gear, it encountered a wind gust that raised the left wing. The captain corrected with a left roll input as he simultaneously reduced the airplane's pitch in an attempt to place the nose wheel onto the runway, but the airplane became airborne and drifted off the runway. The airplane touched down for the second time in the grassy area alongside the runway where the subsequent landing roll was completed without further incident. The captain reported that there were no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation of the airplane. A postaccident examination of the airframe revealed that the right main landing gear had shifted/twisted inside the wheel well damaging both forward and aft spar assemblies. Additionally, the aft movement of the nose landing gear had damaged the forward pressure bulkhead. Both engines appeared to have ingested foreign object debris past their first compressor stages.

One of the three crew members was killed. The airplane departed Saskatoon Airport, SK (YXE) at 15:03 for a geophysical survey flight to the east of Saskatoon.  At about 18:14 the aircraft experienced a shudder from the right engine just before it smoothly spooled down. The propeller rotation slowed and the aircraft yawed. The right engine torque fell below 20%. The crew confirmed that the right engine had lost power. Altitude at the time was 2300 feet and the 2 survey sensors were deployed behind and below the aircraft. The captain set maximum power on the left engine and the crew commenced to shut down the right hand engine. As the first officer had more experience on the aircraft than the captain, the pilots agreed to let the FO continue as pilot flying. The captain would continue with the checklists and radio communications. At 18:17 the captain notified the Saskatoon control tower of the situation with a MAYDAY call, advising they had lost power on one engine and were returning to Saskatoon.  By 18:18, the aircraft had climbed to 2600 feet asl and accelerated to about 99 KIAS, and the pilots had instructed the survey equipment operator to recover the survey sensors. The survey equipment operator got up to do so. The recovery process took 4 to 5 minutes. At 18:25, the flight reached 3100 feet asl (about 1400 agl), the maximum altitude following the right engine power loss. By 18:27, airspeed was about 105 to 110 KIAS, and both pilots had visual contact with the runway. The FO's plan was to fly a high steep approach, and he had not yet reduced the left engine power lever setting for the approach. The tower cleared the flight to land on runway 27. Meanwhile the fuel level left tank or fuel pressure left engine annunciators had illuminated, along with the master caution light. Neither pilot observed these annunciations. At about 18:28, airspeed was 105 KIAS or greater when the left engine smoothly lost power with no surging. The captain observed the torque indicator smoothly and rapidly decreasing from 100% to 20% within a couple of seconds. The airplane decelerated and yawed to the left. The altitude was 3000 feet asl (about 1300 feet agl).  Both pilots immediately concluded the flight would not reach the runway, and the captain pointed out a large street to the FO as a feasible forced landing site and the FO concurred. Neither pilot could see any better alternative. The left hand prop was then feathered. The FO maintained control of the aircraft throughout the descent. Airspeed slowed initially to 100 KIAS and later to 90 KIAS. The goal was to control the descent and impact, with a minimum airspeed of 90 KIAS to prevent a departure from controlled flight.  The pilots observed traffic on the road. They revised the intended touchdown site to the grass beside 51st Street, to the right of the traffic and light poles and the left of what they perceived as a frangible fence. Late in the descent the pilots identified that the fence was actually a noise abatement wall. The FO concluded that the flight could not be extended beyond the noise abatement wall and advised the other crew members. The aircraft landed astride the wall at 90 KIAS. When the aircraft came to a stop, the captain turned off the batteries and the master switch and pressed the cockpit engine fire extinguisher buttons. FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS 1. The right engine lost power when the intermediate spur gear on the torque sensor shaft failed. This resulted in loss of drive to the high-pressure engine-driven pump, fuel starvation, and immediate engine stoppage. 2. The ability of the left-hand No. 2 ejector pump to deliver fuel to the collector tank was compromised by foreign object debris (FOD) in the ejector pump nozzle. 3. When the fuel level in the left collector tank decreased, the left fuel level warning light likely illuminated but was not noticed by the crew. 4. The pilots did not execute the fuel level warning checklist because they did not perceive the illumination of the fuel level left tank warning light. Consequently, the fuel crossfeed valve remained closed and fuel from only the left wing was being supplied to the left engine. 5. The left engine flamed out as a result of depletion of the collector tank and fuel starvation, and the crew had to make a forced landing resulting in an impact with a concrete noise abatement wall.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A11C0047 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Plane crashes in Saskatoon, kills 1 (CBC)  Transport Canada - CADORS 2011C1061   Location  Images: photo (c) Rene Lavallee; Saskatoon Airport, SK; 02 April 2011 photo (c) Rene Lavallee; Saskatoon Airport, SK; 02 April 2011 photo (c) Rene Lavallee; Saskatoon Airport, SK; 02 April 2011 photo (c) Rene Lavallee; Saskatoon Airport, SK; 02 April 2011 photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Pickle Lake Airport, ON (YPL/CYPL); July 2001 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

They also noted, after landing, that there was a burning smell. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed fire damage to the aft equipment bay in the area of the right pylon directly above the auxiliary power unit (APU) exhaust duct.  There was evidence of chaffing on the right integrated drive generator (IDG) power feeder cable as well as damage to an adjacent hydraulic line.  Additionally, two support brackets, designed to secure the hydraulic line to the aft fuselage, near the area of the fire had fractured, with one bracket no longer attached to the fuselage. Consistent with the chafing, there was a pin-sized hole near the end of the hydraulic line where it connected to a fitting that was mounted on a bracket attaching the line to the airplane's structure. The pin-sized hole was near the chafed IDG cable strand, and about 0.0625 inches from the hydraulic line, instead of the required minimum distance of 2.0 inches specified in Bombardier wiring installation specifications. NTSB Metallurgical examinations of the IDG power feeder cable revealed that the damage to the insulation around the pin-sized hole was consistent with chafing.  The examination also found material splatter consistent with electrical arcing of the conductors. The damaged area of the hydraulic line revealed evidence of splattering and material expulsion consistent with electrical arcing against the hydraulic line's external surface. Additionally, the chaffed wire and hydraulic line were examined using energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) to determine if any material transfer consistent with an electrical arcing event, had occurred and the wire and the hydraulic line both had chemical elements not normally found in each. The bracket had fractured into two pieces, and one of the tabs matched the fracture on the main body of the bracket. There was fretting wear damage on the surface of the tab where it was attached to another surface indicative of the tab possibly having rubbed against a bolt or pin used to mount the bracket, and the fracture surface exhibited dimpled ductile fracture that is indicative of overstress bending. As a result of the findings from this accident, both Transport Canada and the FAA released Airworthiness Directives.

The two pilots and the two flight test engineers were fatally injured. The accident occurred during a planned one-engine-inoperative (OEI) takeoff when a stall on the right outboard wing produced a rolling moment that the flight crew was not able to control, which led to the right wingtip contacting the runway and the airplane departing the runway from the right side. After departing the runway, the airplane impacted a concrete structure and an airport weather station, resulting in extensive structural damage and a postcrash fire that completely consumed the fuselage and cabin interior. The National Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB) investigation of this accident found that the airplane stalled while lifting off the ground. As a result, the NTSB examined the role of ""ground effect"" on the airplane's performance. Ground effect refers to changes in the airflow over the airplane resulting from the proximity of the airplane to the ground. Ground effect results in increased lift and reduced drag at a given angle of attack (AOA) as well as a reduction in the stall AOA. In preparing for the G650 field performance flight tests, Gulfstream considered ground effect when predicting the airplane's takeoff performance capability but overestimated the in ground effect stall AOA. Consequently, the airplane's AOA threshold for stick shaker (stall warning) activation and the corresponding pitch limit indicator (on the primary flight display) were set too high, and the flight crew received no tactile or visual warning before the actual stall occurred. The accident flight was the third time that a right outboard wing stall occurred during G650 flight testing. Gulfstream did not determine (until after the accident) that the cause of two previous uncommanded roll events was a stall of the right outboard wing at a lower-than-expected AOA. (Similar to the accident circumstances, the two previous events occurred during liftoff; however, the right wingtip did not contact the runway during either of these events.) If Gulfstream had performed an in-depth aerodynamic analysis of these events shortly after they occurred, the company could have recognized before the accident that the actual in-ground-effect stall AOA was lower than predicted. During field performance testing before the accident, the G650 consistently exceeded target takeoff safety speeds (V2). V2 is the speed that an airplane attains at or before a height above the ground of 35 feet with one engine inoperative. Gulfstream needed to resolve these V2 exceedances because achieving the planned V2 speeds was necessary to maintain the airplane's 6,000-foot takeoff performance guarantee (at standard sea level conditions). If the G650 did not meet this takeoff performance guarantee, then the airplane could only operate on longer runways. However, a key assumption that Gulfstream used to develop takeoff speeds was flawed and resulted in V2 speeds that were too low and takeoff distances that were longer than anticipated. Rather than determining the root cause for the V2 exceedance problem, Gulfstream attempted to reduce the V2 speeds and the takeoff distances by modifying the piloting technique used to rotate the airplane for takeoff. Further, Gulfstream did not validate the speeds using a simulation or physics-based dynamic analysis before or during field performance testing. If the company had done so, then it could have recognized that the target V2 speeds could not be achieved even with the modified piloting technique. In addition, the difficulties in achieving the target V2 speeds were exacerbated in late March 2011 when the company reduced the target pitch angle for some takeoff tests without an accompanying increase in the takeoff speeds. Gulfstream maintained an aggressive schedule for the G650 flight test program so that the company could obtain Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) type certification by the third quarter of 2011. The schedule pressure, combined with inadequately developed organizational processes for technical oversight and safety management, led to a strong focus on keeping the program moving and a reluctance to challenge key assumptions and highlight anomalous airplane behavior during tests that could slow the pace of the program. These factors likely contributed to key errors, including the development of unachievable takeoff speeds, as well as the superficial review of the two previous uncommanded roll events, which allowed the company's overestimation of the in-ground-effect stall AOA to remain undetected. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the cause of this accident was an aerodynamic stall and subsequent uncommanded roll during a one engine-inoperative takeoff flight test, which were the result of (1) Gulfstream's failure to properly develop and validate takeoff speeds for the flight tests and recognize and correct the takeoff safety speed (V2) error during previous G650 flight tests, (2) the G650 flight test team's persistent and increasingly aggressive attempts to achieve V2 speeds that were erroneously low, and (3) Gulfstream's inadequate investigation of previous G650 uncommanded roll events, which indicated that the company's estimated stall angle of attack while the airplane was in ground effect was too high. Contributing to the accident was Gulfstream's failure to effectively manage the G650 flight test program by pursuing an aggressive program schedule without ensuring that the roles and responsibilities of team members had been appropriately defined and implemented, engineering processes had received sufficient technical planning and oversight, potential hazards had been fully identified, and appropriate risk controls had been implemented and were functioning as intended.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NTSB/AAR-12/02 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Channel Six News  Gulfstream statement  NTSB  SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Roswell International Air Center Airport, NM (ROW/KROW); 03 April 2011 photo (c) NTSB; Roswell International Air Center Airport, NM (ROW/KROW); 03 April 2011; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Roswell International Air Center Airport, NM (ROW/KROW); 03 April 2011; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Roswell International Air Center Airport, NM (ROW/KROW); 03 April 2011; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Roswell International Air Center Airport, NM (ROW/KROW); 03 April 2011; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Roswell International Air Center Airport, NM (ROW/KROW); 03 April 2011; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Roswell International Air Center Airport, NM (ROW/KROW); 03 April 2011; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane carried 29 passengers and four crew members. One passenger survived the accident. The airplane operated on behalf of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) on flight UNO834, a round trip from Kinshasa-N'Djili Airport (FIH) to Kisangani (FKI).  The aircraft took off from Kisangani for Kinshasa at 12:18. The pilot in command was the pilot flying on this leg. At 13:31, the crew reported to Kinshasa Approach that they were over position GURUT (137 NM from Kinshasa), gave their Expected Time of Arrival Kinshasa as 13:55 and received the latest Kinshasa weather information. At the time, Kinshasa weather being reported was wind 340 degrees, 8 knots, visibility 10 km, scattered clouds at 2500 feet, Charlie Bravos (CBs) at 3000 feet, CBs in the North East and South East, Temperature 33, dew point 23, QNH 1009, trend NOSIG. At 13:39, UNO 834 requested for descent and was cleared to descend to flight level 100. Meanwhile, on the on-board weather radar, the crew were able to notice presence of severe weather around and over Kinshasa airfield. At 13:49, when the aircraft was about 32 NMs from Kinshasa VOR/DME, the crew again sought latest weather information from Kinshasa ATC. They were informed that Kinshasa was reporting ""wind 210 degrees, 8 knots, visibility 8 KM, thunderstorm over the station, scattered cloud at 2500 feet, few Charlie Bravo 3000 feet, Charlie Bravo located north-east, south west and west, broken 12000 feet, temperature 33, dew point 23, QNH 1008, trend NOSIG"". The co-pilot replied to ATC that weather was copied and read back the QNH. At 13:50, UNO 854 was cleared for a straight-in Localizer approach for runway 24. The crew discussed options of avoiding the severe weather being displayed on their on-board weather radar by skirting around the radar returns. The aircraft approached the airfield at high speed. The indicated air speed came below 250 knots at 13:53 when the aircraft was descending through an altitude of 4630 feet and was 13 NM from threshold runway 24. While intercepting the Localizer for runway 24, the aircraft remained to the south (left) of the Localizer path. During the execution of the Localizer Approach, the crew made a more than 15 degree heading change to fly even further away from the Localizer path when the aircraft was between 10-7 NM from runway 24. As the aircraft came close to the airfield, the co-pilot sighted the runway on his right one o'clock position, when the aircraft was about 9.7 nautical miles from displaced threshold of runway 24. The PIC too, sighted the runway when the aircraft was about 6.4 NM away from threshold. At that stage, the aircraft speed was 210 knots, altitude was 3250 feet (or about 2252 feet above ground level) and the aircraft was in clean configuration. The crew decided to continue their Approach. The captain disengaged the autopilot, turned towards the runway and gave instructions to co-pilot to configure the aircraft for landing. The crew managed to regain Localizer path and align the aircraft to the runway by the time they were 2 NM from the threshold. At around this time, Kinshasa airfield was affected by a squall line. As the aircraft came on short finals, it encountered rain. By this stage, the aircraft was below the Minimum Descent Altitude (MDA) for Localizer Approach for runway 24. MDA for Localizer Approach for Runway 24 is 1470 feet or 472 feet Above Ground Level (AGL). The crew switched on wind shield wipers. As they descended further to about 224 feet AGL and runway was not in sight, the crew decided to carry out a go around. During the process of go around, a positive rate of climb was established with appropriate airspeed. While climbing through an altitude of 1395 feet (or 397 feet AGL); the aircraft encountered a severe weather phenomenon (probably a microburst). The wind shear warning came on. The aircraft pitched significantly nose down (from about 4-5 degrees nose up attitude to 7 degrees nose down attitude) in a very short period of time. The aircraft rapidly lost height. Before the crew could react to the pitch down and recover from the steep descent, the aircraft impacted the terrain. The airplane broke up and the main wreckage came to rest upside down. Probable cause of the Accident: The most probable cause of the accident was the aircraft's encounter with a severe Microburst like weather phenomenon at a very low altitude during the process of Go Around. The severe vertical gust/downdraft caused a significant and sudden pitch change to the aircraft which resulted in a considerable loss of height. Being at very low altitude, recovery from such a disturbance was not possible. The possibility of a somatogravic illusion caused Loss Of Control (LOC) as the primary cause of the accident, was also discussed by the investigation team. This was ruled out based on available evidence which showed that during the Go Around, the crew had initiated the climb at 1256 32 and had thereafter, maintained a climbing attitude for the next 12 seconds. At 1256 44, the aircraft experienced a sudden and steep nose down attitude change without a corresponding control input by the crew (as shown by FDR), Hence, Somatogravic Illusion caused Loss of Control was ruled out as a cause of accident. Probable contributing factors: 1. The inappropriate decision of the crew to continue the approach, in face of extremely inclement weather being displayed on their weather radar, was probably the principle contributing factor responsible for the accident. 2. Lack of adequate supervision by the Operator to ensure that its crew complied with established procedures including weather avoidance procedures and Stabilized Approach criteria, was a probable contributing factor. 3. Inadequacy of Georgian Airways Training program for upgrade to Captain was a probable contributing Factor. 4. Lack of effective oversight of Georgian Airways by Georgian CAA was a probable contributing factor. 5. Lack of appropriate equipment at Kinshasa airport for identification and tracking of adverse weather phenomenon, resulting in failure by ATC to provide appropriate early warning to the aircraft, was probably a contributing factor. 6. ATC not declaring the airfield closed when visibility dropped below Minima was a probable contributory factor.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: IAAI DRC Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: AFP  Radio Okapi  MONUSCO statement  SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) Clive Hindmarch; Kinshasa-N'Djili Airport (FIH/FZAA); 11 July 2008 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft then continued to advance on the tractor. At 0944:45, the part of the bar still connected to the nose gear contacted the tractor and causes an additional rotation of the front axle. The tyre The right side splits on the left side of the tractor. The aircraft came to rest against the latter. The crew applies the park brake, as requested by wire link. Conclusion: The accident resulted from the decision to perform a PULL pushback manoeuvre, after an incomplete PUSH pushback, while an engine was running. The organisation of the sharing of procedures between the operator and all assistance personnel at the time of the accident contributed to the accident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Report number: c-vm110410 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

They requested a deviation around the weather, but the air traffic controller requested that they stand by. After entering the weather, they received clearance to turn; however, about 24,000 feet, the airplane encountered about 11 seconds of moderate, and then severe, turbulence. During the encounter, two flight attendants received broken ankles while conducting work in the aft cabin area. The digital flight data recorder revealed that during the encounter vertical acceleration forces went from 2.2G to 0.6913G within 1 second, to a minimum of 0.496G about 5 seconds after the 2.2G maximum.  A weather study conducted by a National Transportation Safety Board meteorologist revealed a frontal wave over the Japanese coast with a warm front extending eastward in the vicinity of the turbulence encounter. A gale force wind was expected. The region of the turbulence encounter also contained low to mid-level clouds with cloud tops near 14,000 feet; cumulonimbus cloud development, with tops up to 26,000 feet, was slightly upstream from the turbulence encounter. Review of the weather package given to the flight crew found no forecasts for turbulence and no Significant Meteorological Information advisories (SIGMETS) were in effect for the route of flight. At the time of the occurrence, there were no reports of turbulence from pilots ahead of the accident flight and the flight crew saw no indication of turbulence on their weather radar. Probable Cause: An inadvertent encounter with convective-induced turbulence upon entering cumulonimbus clouds.Sources: NTSB History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  20 January 2011 N766AN American Airlines 0 80 nm SE of New York, NY (Atlantic Ocean) non Near miss with other aircraft Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates20-Apr-2011 12:05 espeluk Added 21-Apr-2011 02:22 harro Updated [Date, Time, Total occupants, Source, ]21-Dec-2016 19:25 ASN Update Bot Updated [Time, Damage, Category, Investigating agency, ]27-Nov-2017 16:51 ASN Update Bot Updated [Cn, Operator, Other fatalities, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

There were no injuries among the 202 passengers and 13 crew members. Flight 470 took off from Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG) at 08:55 UTC on a regular service to Caracas, Venezuela. The en route part of the flight was uneventful. Weather at the destination was poor due to the presence of several thunderstorms and rain. The captain was pilot flying during the ILS approach to runway 10 at Caracas. The airplane was aligned with the localizer at 10 NM from the threshold and the glideslope was intercepted at 6 NM. The crew selected a Vapp approach speed of 136 kts and moments later disconnected the autopilot and autothrottle. Passing 1000 feet above aerodrome level the crew was able to observe the runway. Descent rate at the time was -950 feet per minute and the airplane had rolled 3Â° to the right at an airspeed of 153 kt (Vapp + 17 kt). Shortly before passing 500 feet the captain had to correct some deviations, causing roll angles reaching 9Â°. At 200 feet the airplane was above the glide path and the pilot monitoring reported that the airspeed increased from 138 kt to 153 kt. The airspeed decreased again to below 136 kts with the GPWS warning ""Sink Rate!"" at 35 feet. The airplane touched down at 2,74 G with a descent rate of -1200 ft/min. Flight 470 taxied to the terminal without any problems. The captain reported the hard landing in the Aircraft Technical Log and reported it to the station manager at Caracas. One Air France technician performed a walk around check in very heavy rain and low light conditions. The Aircraft Condition Monitoring System (ACMS) did not generate an automated 'hard landing' report, and no report was received at the company's Maintenance Control Center (MCC). The Data Management Unit (DMU), part of the ACMS was checked and it was concluded that there was no defect. Consequently, the airplane was released for the return flight to Paris. Upon takeoff from Caracas at 18:30 local time, the crew were not able to raise the undercarriage. Several alarms related to cabin conditioning were triggered and displayed on the ECAM. After burning off fuel the crew landed safely back at Caracas. After parking, significant damage was found on the right hand main landing gear and fuselage structure. Causes: The hard landing is due to the continuation of the landing while the flight path changes should have lead to a go-around. The workload generated by flying without the assistance of A/THR, in degraded weather conditions is a contributing factor. The hard landing caused the implosion of the fixed piston of the damper of the right hand landing gear, which was not detectable on the ground at the stopover. This made it impossible to retract the landing gear during the return flight. The use of inadequate technical notes, the operator into force the day of the event and the lack of issuance of report R15 did not detect the damage caused by the hard landing. This has led to the departure of a commercial flight with a badly damaged aircraft.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Report number: f-cb110413 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  20 July 2023 F-GZCB Air France 0 Lome Airport (LFW/DXXX) min Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Osborne Airport (MNI/TRPG)"," AAIB","Accident investigation report completed and information captured","Following an uneventful flight from Antigua-V.C. Bird International Airport (ANU), the aircraft made an approach to runway 10 at John A. Osborne Airport, Montserrat. After a normal touchdown the pilot applied the brakes and noticed that there was no resistance from the right brake pedal. While maintaining directional control with the rudder pedals the pilot tried to ""pump"" the brake pedals but this had no effect on the right brakes. To avoid departing the end of the runway the pilot applied left brake and allowed the aircraft to veer left onto the grass just beyond the taxiway exit. The aircraft struck an embankment located 20 m north of the runway edge, about 150 m from the end of the runway. The impact, which was estimated by the pilot to be at about 10 kt, resulted in damage to the nose structure and caused the nose landing gear leg to collapse. The left wing tip leading edge was also damaged when it struck the embankment. After the aircraft came to rest the passengers were able to exit the aircraft via the main door The probable cause for the loss of right braking was trapped air in the right brake hydraulic lines. This air may have been present prior to the O-ring seal removal but was more likely to have been introduced during the seal removal and replacement. The engineer had carried out a brake bleeding procedure but he had not completed the full procedure as described in the AMM. He had not opened the bleed screw at the top of the right landing gear leg, and therefore air may have remained trapped in these lines. The investigation revealed the existence of several different brake bleeding procedures. The aircraft manufacturer had three different brake bleeding procedures, namely the Islander AMM procedure, the Trislander AMM procedure and their own production procedure. Three engineers from three different maintenance organisations had suggested that sometimes the manufacturerÂs procedures were inadequate for completely bleeding all the air out and that a hand pump attached to the brake bleed screws was sometimes required.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: EW/C2011/04/05 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  23 September 2019 VP-MNI FlyMontserrat 0 Montserrat-John A.

The flight from Shanghai, China, was uneventful and a normal final approach was established to Copenhagen Airport's runway 22L at 1000 feet AGL with the autopilot off and the auto throttle engaged. The airspeed was 152 knots and the vertical speed was 830 feet/min.  During the flare the pilot flying started to correct the rate of decent by increasing the pitch attitude. At touchdown the pitch attitude was 4.6Â°, the computed airspeed was 143 knots, the vertical speed was 160 feet/min.  The aircraft touched down and bounced three times. After the first bounce, the ground spoilers automatically retracted and the auto braking system disarmed. A second bounce occurred followed by a third bounce. After the third bounce, the speed brakes handle was pulled either by the pilot flying or by thrust reverser command, which deployed the ground spoilers and the thrust reversers.  The reversers were deployed in 11 seconds. During the deceleration, the pitch angle gradually increased to 10.5Â° and the aircraft suffered a tailstrike. At the same time the pilot flying felt an increasing pitch up attitude and decided to initiate a go-around.  An initiation of a GA after thrust reverser activation is very risky and not an option according to the Boeing 777 Flight Crew Operating Manual (FCOM) and the Boeing 777 Flight Crew Training Manual (FCTM). After the ground spoilers were retracted and the reversers were stowed, the pitch angle was decreased to 7.0Â°. At that time, the indicated airspeed was 117 knots. Engine power was applied and as the airspeed increased. The increase of the forward engine thrust caused a further nose up pitch moment, resulting in an increasing pitch angle of 11.9Â°. During lift off the indicated airspeed (IAS) was 140 knots, which was 8 knots below the V2 calculated speed. The lower speed gave less lift and kept the main landing gear compressed. The result was less aft tail belly clearance, leading the second tail strike. During initial climb, the flight crew noticed a beeper aural warning and the tailstrike caution on the upper Engine Indication and Crew Alerting System (EICAS) display. The flight crew performed a tail strike Malfunction Check List and a Go Around Check List. The pilot not flying informed ATC about the go around and the tailstrike indication and that the pilots didn't have control problems with the aircraft. A new approach was requested to runway 22L.The aircraft landed without further problems. CONCLUSIONS: After the third bounce and at touch down, the PF didnÂt prevent the pitch angle to increase. The lack of forward elevator control input caused the first tail strike.  During the GA, the aircraft was rotated to a pitch angle of 10.2Â° which caused the second tail strike.  The tail strike was prolonged as the pitch angle increased to 11.9Â° with a V2 speed minus 8 knots, which prolonged the time with a compressed main landing gear and less aft tail clearance.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: HCLJ Report number: HCLJ510-000835 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) Miklos SZABO; Milano-Malpensa Airport (MXP/LIMC); 10 September 2011 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane carried 19 passengers and six crew members. All on board were killed in the accident. The airplane operated on Merpati flight MZ8968 from Sorong (SOQ) to Kaimana (KNG), Nabire (NBX), and Biak (BIK). The flight took off from Sorong at 12:50 for the one hour and four minutes flight to Kaimana. Cruising altitude was 15.500 feet and weather forecast for Kaimana indicated rain with a visibility of 8 km, half of the sky covered with clouds with cloud base at 1400 ft, winds from the southeast at 6 mph (5.2 kts) and temperature of 29Â°C.  At 13:25 the crew received updated weather information, indicating that visibility had decreased to 3-8 km, with cumulonimbus clouds at 1500 ft. At about 13:37, MZ 8968 reported at 7 nautical miles from the airport, descending through an altitude of 8000 ft.  Five minutes later the Kaimana AFIS (Aerodrome Flight Information Service) officer informed the crew that it was still raining at the airport and the ground visibility was 2 kilometers. During the approach to Kaimana, the flight crew flew to the south of the airport in an attempt to make a visual approach. The auto-pilot was disengaged at 960 feet pressure altitude. At 376 feet pressure altitude, the crew decided to discontinue the approach and climbed, turning to the left. Engine power was increased and flaps were retracted from 15 to 5 and subsequently to 0 degrees. The landing gear was also retracted. The aircraft rolled to the left with a bank angle of 11Â° and continuously increased up to 38Â°. The rate of descend increased significantly up to about 3000 feet per minute and the airplane finally impacted into the shallow sea. Kaimana Airport has a single runway, 01/19 (asphalt, length 5249 feet / 1600 m) which runs parallel to the coast with the sea to the west and mountains to the east. The airplane crashed into the sea about 800 m southwest of the runway 01 threshold and 550 m from the beach. It broke up and sank to a depth of about 15 metres. The airplane had been manufacturer in 2008. It was stored at the factory in Xian until it was delivered to Merpati in December 2010. Factors contributed to the accident are as follows: 1. The flight was conducted in VFR in condition that was not suitable for visual approach when the visibility was 2 km. In such a situation a visual approach should not have been attempted. 2. There was no checklist reading and crew briefing. 3. The flight crew had lack of situation awareness when tried to find the runway, and discontinued the approach. 4. The missed approach was initiated at altitude 376 feet pressure altitude (250 feet radio altitude), the pilot open power to 70% and 82% torque followed by flap retracted to 5 and subsequently to 0. The rapid descent was mainly caused by continuously increase of roll angle up to 38 degree to the left and the retraction of flaps from 15 to 0 position. 5. Both crew had low experience/flying time on type. 6. Inadequacy/ineffectivity in the training program may lead to actions that deviated from the standard procedure and regression to the previous type.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSC Report number: KNKT.11.05.10.04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources: Ministry of Transportation Indonesia  SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) National.

The seatbelt sign was turned off at FL320.  The airplane leveled off at a final cruise altitude of 37,000' and the ride was smooth up until the turbulence encounter.  Both the captain's and first officer's weather radar was in use before and during the turbulence event, and there was no adverse weather along the route visible on radar.  The flight crew received no weather updates from Air Traffic Control, no pilot reports (PIREPS), and there was no traffic along the same route in front of this flight. Evaluation of the winds using FDR data revealed that the aircraft sustained strong and adverse wind fluctuations on all three axes during the turbulence encounter, which included an upwards vertical wind gradient was about 80 knots in a 10 second timeframe.  Recorded ground weather radar information revealed that the flight was probably passing over or through the extreme top of a rapidly developing area of convective weather at the time of the turbulence encounter. Although ground based radar reflectivity data indicated that the precipitation rate within this rapidly developing cell at the time was light to moderate, detection of the cell would likely have required active adjustment of the aircraft's weather radar system. However, the flight crew was not actively manipulating the aircraft radar at the time of the event given the lack of severe weather indications. Probable Cause: An inadvertent encounter with unforecast convective turbulence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA11FA053 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA11FA053  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

There were 126 passengers and eight crew members on board. The airplane operated on a flight KGL348 from Surgut Airport (SGC) to Moskva-Domodedovo Airport (DME). Three passengers died and about 32 were seriously injured. The airplane was destroyed by fire. Initial reports indicate that the airplane had been towed to the main taxiway for engine startup. A short circuit occurred while the AC generators were connected to the aircraft's electrical system after start-up of the engines. A fire erupted in the rear, spreading quickly through the main cabin. The crew shut down the engines and initiated an evacuation.  The Interstate Aviation Committee reported that engines no. 1, 2 and 3 and the APU were not the source of the fire. The fire started in the rear of the aircraft in the area of frames 62-65. The cause of the fire was an electrical arc produced by electrical currents exceeding ten to twenty times the nominal loads when two generators not synchronised with each other were brought online but got connected together instead of being connected to parallel busses. The unsynchronised operation of the generators can be attributed to: - Poor technical conditions of contacts TKS233DOD responsible for connecting the generators with the electrical busses, that were damaged by prolonged operation without maintenance. A contact normally open was welded and fractured insulation material moved between contacts that are normally closed. These abnormal contact positions led to the connection between #2 and #3 generators. - Differences in the schematic diagrams of generator 2 and generators 1 and 3. When the switch is moved from ""check"" to ""enable"" with no delay in the ""neutral"" position generator 2 is brought online without time delay which leads to increased wear of normally closed contacts in the TKS233DOD unit. - The specific design of the electrical systems to ensure power supply to each bus from either the APU or either engine integrated drive generator.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: At least one dead, three missing in plane explosion in Siberia (Update 3) (RIA)  MAK Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC)  Russian Ministry of Health statement  Russian Ministry of Transport statement   Location  Images: photo (c) MAK; Surgut Airport (SGC); January 2011 photo (c) MAK; Surgut Airport (SGC); January 2011 photo (c) andy@g4sp.co.uk; Moskva-Domodedovo Airport (DME/UUDD); 28 July 2008 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

No injuries occurred during the event. The flight landed uneventfully at Toronto-Lester Pearson International Airport, Canada, where damage to the tail skid was discovered. Further damage to the aft pressure bulkhead was later discovered, and this damage was determined to be substantial. According to the captain, normal procedures were followed during preflight and taxi, including verification of the takeoff bug speeds. During the takeoff roll, the automatic, aircraft-generated V1 callout occurred and he began to rotate the airplane. The first officer did not call for rotation at that time. The captain applied nose up pitch command until he realized the indicated airspeed was too low. He said he then eased the nose of the airplane back down to the runway and re-rotated at the normal rotation speed, achieving approximately 10 degrees nose up at about 155 to 160 knots. The FO said he noticed that the automatic voice callout occurred about 20 knots early and observed the captain rotate for takeoff, but he said nothing to the captain for fear of causing confusion. The rest of the climbout, cruise, descent, and landing at Toronto was uneventful. According to the first officer, during preflight preparations, due to a last minute runway change, the takeoff data V speeds did not automatically upload into the flight management computer (FMC), so he manually entered the speeds using information on the preflight paperwork. Flight planning data indicated that the airplane takeoff weight was 161,037 pounds with a center of gravity at 22.5% mean aerodynamic chord, which under the conditions at the time of the accident should have resulted in a flaps 1 takeoff with V1 (takeoff decision speed) of 153 knots, a Vr (rotation speed) also of 153 knots, and V2 (scheduled takeoff speed) of 158 knots. The recorded data indicates the manually entered V speeds in the FMC were V1 123 knots, Vr 153 knots and V2 158 knots. Probable cause: The early rotation of the airplane to an angle at which the fuselage contacted the runway.  Contributing to early rotation was the CaptainÂs reaction to the erroneous V1 automated callout, likely assuming that the airplane was at or close to the correct Vr at the same time.  The erroneous automated callout was likely due to a keystroke entry error by the FO when manually entering takeoff data for a newly assigned departure runway.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA11FA050 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The Captain, in the right seat, took over the controls and used the information from the right horizon to continue the flight. The co-pilot noticed that the amber generator lights were on. He tried unsuccessfully to stop and start them.  The captain decided to abort the flight. He asked the co-pilot to extend the landing gear. During the extension sequence, the aircraft suffered a total electrical failure. The lighting conditions in the cockpit were then very dark and the crew had difficulty in reading the instrument displays. The captain asked the co-pilot to shine a flashlight on the instruments. He briefly saw the threshold of runway 31R. The co-pilot suggested that he go around as he was unsure that the gear was locked down. During the aerodrome circuit at low height the co-pilot continued extending the landing gear manually. The emergency landing being imminent, the co-pilot stopped doing this, even though he was unsure that the gear was locked down because he didnÂt feel enough resistance to indicate that the gear was extended and locked down. Given the weather and the difficulty of reading the instruments, the captain decided to land. During the landing roll the main landing gear collapsed slowly, the fuselage came into contact with the ground and the aircraft stopped on the runway.Sources: BEA  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Flight IR277 took off from Tehran-Mehrabad Airport at 18:33 local time (15:03 UTC) and continued its route via UL125 and G781 towards Urmia. At 15:37 UTC, after coordinating with Tehran Control Center for an approach to Urmia Airport, the aircraft began to descend and at 15:42 UTC contacted the Urmia Tower and was cleared for the TUBAR2A procedure and a VOR/DME/ILS approach to runway 21.  Weather at the airport was poor with a visibility of about 800 m in heavy snow. During the execution of the approach procedure to land at Urmia Airport, the aircraft's stick shaker (stall warning) was activated due to the low speed in relation to the flap settings. The problem was resolved after corrective action was taken. At 15:54:49 UTC, the Urmia Tower controller requested the position of flight IR277 three times. Then, the flight reported its position as being 5 miles away. The Urmia Tower controller then inquired if the aircraft was established on the ILS, to which the flight responded negatively. The Urmia Tower controller then asked the flight if it intended to continue its approach for landing. In response, flight IR277 reported that it had abandoned the approach and was performing a missed approach. The controller then requested that the flight rejoin the IAF (Initial Approach Fix) for runway 21, and flight IR277 confirmed this. After the missed approach at 16:00:41 UTC, despite being at an altitude of 8,768 feet, with a pitch-up angle of 8.1 degrees and a left bank angle of 26 degrees, the aircraft, with a speed of 170 knots (within the operational limit) and flaps set at 50 degrees, experienced a second stick shaker activation and a decrease in altitude, indicating the aircraft was approaching the stall speed threshold. This possibly occurred due to a aerodynamic change in the aircraft, potentially due to ice formation on parts of the aircraft, such as the tail section, which lacks an anti-ice system, which led to an increase in stall speed.  The engine pressure ratio (EPR) of all three engines increased from (1.30 - 1.25 - 1.36) to (1.46 - 1.48 - 1.53) and then decreased over four seconds to (1.05 - 1.07 - 1.06). This could have been caused by disturbed airflow entering the engines, combined with the increase in bank angle from 26 to 40 degrees to the left, likely due to the stall. To recover from the stall, at 16:00:50 UTC, the pilot instructed for maximum power to be applied to all three engines. Initially, engine 3 reached an EPR of 2.14 at 16:00:53 UTC. However, due to disturbed airflow entering the engine, the EPR dropped, leading to engine failure. Five seconds later, engine 1 also failed in a similar manner. At 16:00:53 UTC, the Urmia Tower controller asked for the position of flight IR277 again. The flight responded with ""Standby."" The tower controller then asked for the flight's intentions, and the response was that they were abandoning the approach. Due to intermittent radio communication, the tower controller requested a repetition of the last transmission. Flight IR277 then stated, ""We are going to Tehran."" At 16:01:07 UTC, the pilot ordered maximum engine power. Only engine 2 responded, reaching an EPR of 2.11. The flaps were then retracted, leading to a quicker loss of altitude. At 16:01:08 UTC, in a radial of 150 degrees from the VOR and at a distance of 30 kilometers from the airport, near the villages of Meshkabad Olya and Hasanlu, the aircraft impacted terrain and broke up. Main Cause of the Accident: The main cause of the accident was the unfavorable and abnormal conditions experienced by the aircraft, combined with inadequate handling by the cockpit crew in response to the emerging situation. Contributing Factors: - The outdated technology of the aircraft's systems. - The lack of a suitable simulator for adverse weather conditions. - Failure to properly follow operational procedures by the flight crew. - Inadequate cockpit management (CRM).

Reverse thrust was selected immediately after touchdown, but the aircraft subsequently bounced and the commander decided to go-around.  During the go-around the No 2 (right) engine thrust reverser failed to stow, and the engine thrust was maintained at idle by the FADEC system. The aircraftâs tail struck the ground during the rotation. The aircraft became airborne at low speed in a high drag configuration and its acceleration and climb performance did not increase appreciably until 47 seconds after lift off.  The No 2 engine was subsequently shut down and the aircraft diverted to Stansted Airport, where a single engine landing was carried out. The No 1 thrust reverser was selected during the landing at Stansted, but did not fully deploy. The investigation found that the most likely reason for the No 2 thrust reverser failure to stow was an intermittent loose connection in the auto-restow circuit. It was further determined that conflicting operational guidance exists with respect to selection of reverse thrust and go-around procedures. A number of safety actions have been taken as a result of this serious incident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: EW/C2011/01/03 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: http://avherald.com/h?article=43691dea/0000&opt=0  http://www.aaib.gov.uk/cms_resources.cfm?file=/Airbus%20A300-B4-622R%20TF-ELK%2005-12.pdf  https://www.planespotters.net/Production_List/Airbus/A300/557,TF-ELK-TNT-Airways.php Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates10-May-2012 12:52 ryan Added 14-Oct-2012 17:35 Dr. John Smith Updated [Aircraft type, Cn, Source, Embed code, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

This resulted in an altitude deviation of minus 400 feet to plus 400 feet from the assigned altitude of 35 000 feet above sea level. Fourteen passengers and 2 flight attendants were injured. The seatbelt sign had been selected âonâ approximately 40 minutes prior to the pitch excursion. The flight continued to destination whereupon 7 passengers were sent to hospital and were later released. Findings as to Causes and Contributing Factors 1. The interrupted sleep obtained by the first officer prior to the flight increased the likelihood that rest would be needed during the overnight eastbound flight. 2. The first officer slept for approximately 75 minutes which likely placed the first officer into slow-wave sleep and induced longer and more severe sleep inertia. 3. The first officer was experiencing a circadian low due to the time of day and fatigue due to interrupted sleep which increased the propensity for sleep and subsequently worsened the sleep inertia. 4. By identifying the oncoming aircraft, the captain engaged the first officer (FO) before the effects of sleep inertia had worn off. 5. Under the effects of sleep inertia, the first officer perceived the oncoming aircraft to be on a collision course and pushed forward on the control column. 6. The frequency of training and depth of the training material on fatigue risk management to which the flight crew were exposed were such that the risks associated with fatigue were not adequately understood and procedures for conducting controlled rest were not followed by the flight crew. 7. Although the seatbelt sign was on and an announcement about potential turbulence was made, several passengers were injured during the event because they were not wearing their seatbelt.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A11F0012 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: http://web.archive.org/web/20110118070027/http://www.cbc.ca:80/canada/story/2011/01/14/air-canada-turbulence-switzerland.html?  https://www.blick.ch/news/schweiz/kinder-und-eine-schwangere-betroffen-flug-mit-14-verletzten-in-zuerich-gelandet-id67269.html  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates15-Jan-2011 02:28 peterj Added 15-Jan-2011 04:59 harro Updated [Aircraft type, Registration, Cn, Location, Country, Source, Damage, ]24-Dec-2023 19:02 harro Updated [Other fatalities, Location, Country, Narrative, Category, Accident report, ]24-Dec-2023 19:03 harro Updated [Other fatalities, Departure airport, Destination airport, Category, ]27-Apr-2024 13:28 ASN Updated Corrections or additions? ...

The pilot and five passengers were fatally injured. The flight originated at BrasÃ­lia-Presidente Juscelino Kubitschek International Airport, DF (BSB). During a VOR approach to runway 32 in heavy rain, the airplane impacted Santo AntÃ´nio Hill, 11 km short of the runway. Contributing Factors (translated from Portuguese) - Obesity - undetermined Factors such as obesity and sedentary lifestyle, associated with the high workload in the moments before the collision with the hill, may have contributed to the fact that the task requirement in the final approach exceeded safety margins, leading to a wrong decision of the pilot. - Attitude - unspecified In facing adverse weather conditions and knowing that previous landing aircraft had better visibility at altitude below 3,500 feet in the final approach of the VOR procedure, the pilot may have raised the level of confidence in the situation to the point of continuing descent without considering the risk involved. - Emotional state - undetermined The conditions that were present in the final phase of the flight may have raised the level of tension in the cabin to the point of compromising the management of the situation by the pilot, who left the task of communicating to the passenger. - Decision-making process When considering that the pilot decided to descend from the minimum altitude to achieve visual conditions, it can be assumed that his decision, probably influenced by the experiences of previous aircraft, was made without adequately assessing the risks involved and without considering the option of flying IFR, taking in view of local weather. In addition, the pilot's decision-making process may have been compromised by the lack of information about the Morro de Santo AntÃ´nio in the approach letter - publication of aid for the pilot in flight. - Adverse weather conditions - contributed The images provided by the primary radar of the AnÃ¡polis Control (APP-AN) indicated the existence of strong cloudiness associated with heavy formations in the final approach of the VOR procedure. These conditions influenced the occurrence, causing the collision of the aircraft against the Morro de Santo AntÃ´nio, independently of the hypotheses raised in the investigation. - Navigation deviation - contributed The final approach on course 320 Â° (instead of the expected 325 Â°) led the aircraft to line up with the hill where the collision occurred. - ATS Publication - undefined Morro de Santo AntÃ´nio, an obstacle to control the final approach in which the aircraft collision occurred, was not identified in the VOR approach letter for lane 32, as anticipated by CIRTRAF 100-30, a fact that may have contributed to a possible reduction of situational awareness.METAR: 19:42 UTC /  local time: SBGO 141942Z 23007KT 1000 SHRA SCT013 BKN020 BKN080 25/22 Q1012 =20:00 UTC /  local time: SBGO 142000Z 20005KT 1600 -SHRA SCT010 BKN020 FEW030TCU BKN080 23/22 Q1012 =20:10 UTC /  local time: SBGO 142010Z 35002KT 4000 -TSRA FEW010 SCT030 FEW040CB BKN100 23/22 Q1013=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CENIPA Report number: A-606/CENIPA/2014 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 years and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  O Hoje 16-1-2011   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

King Airport (STT/TIST)","San Juan-Luis MuÃ±oz MarÃ­n International Airport (SJU/TJSJ)"," NTSB","Accident investigation report completed and information captured","A Convair 340-71 cargo plane, N8277Q, experienced an in-flight fire aft of the left engine shortly after takeoff from Cyril E. King Airport (STT), Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands. The flight was cleared for takeoff from runway 28 at Saint Thomas Airport at 07:47 hours local time. At 07:48:44, the local controller advised the flightcrew, ""Convair seven seven quebec observe a lot of smoke coming from your left engine are you in need of any assistance sir"", to which the captain (pilot not flying) stated, ""ah no we are fine..."" The captain attributed the smoke trailing from the left engine to the age of the airplane.  The crew then switched frequencies to San Juan Combined En Route Approach Control (San Juan CERAP). Upon receiving a message from the local controller at Saint Thomas, CERAP reported to the flight crew that flames were now observed on the left hand engine. After being notified of the fire, the co-pilot reported they checked the engine instruments and did not have any indication of a fire. About that time the owner of the company who was airborne in another airplane told them they needed to return. The captain ordered the co-pilot to go into the cabin to visually look at the left engine and after returning to the cockpit informed the captain there was a fire. The captain advised that he executed the procedures for fire checklist and secured the left engine but the fire continued. The flight returned for landing at Saint Thomas, and at 07:50:50, the pilot of a company airplane reported, ""...you definitely have a fire going."" The flight continued towards Saint Thomas and ATC communications were transferred to STT ATCT. At 07:53:21, the flight was cleared to land. The captain later reported that while returning to Saint Thomas, he noticed an issue with the left aileron which the co-pilot assisted with. The airplane was landed on runway centerline at 90 knots, but the flightcrew were unable to stop the airplane. The captain also reported that there was no steering, the brakes were not working properly. During the landing roll the airport fire rescue vehicles followed the airplane while attempting to extinguish the fire and avoiding debris that was separating from the airplane. The airplane departed the right side of the runway, crossed a taxiway and a perimeter road, then went through the airport perimeter fence and came to rest upright with the nose section over a public road outside of the airport property. After the airplane came to rest, the flightcrew exited the airplane from the overwing exits, and the fire rescue vehicles converged on the airplane and extinguished the fire. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The captainÂs decision to continue the flight with the left engine backfiring, resulting in an engine fire shortly after takeoff. Contributing to the accident were the captainÂs decision to continue the flight following a report of black smoke trailing the airplane and in-flight fire damage to the left wheel brake system, resulting in a loss of directional control during an emergency landing.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA11LA117 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Prior to departure the crew did not remove accumulated snow on the upper surface of the wing. Relevant Events and Factors: a. Contaminated ice and snow on tail section most likely cause sluggish rotation during the takeoff; this will result in over rotation, over rotation result in wing stall. b. Contamination of snow and ice on the wing, fuselage and tail will compromise the normal takeoff characteristics. c. With snow and ice and combination of disruptive air flow, heavier actual weights and over rotation, the combinations most likely not activate any stall warning safety design. The aircraft could stall asymmetrical without warning during takeoff. d.

Descending through 34,668 feet, the tailwind suddenly decreased and the indicated speed of the airplane quickly increased. The captain activated the speed brakes and disengaged the autopilot. Subsequently, the airplane began to slow. As the captain was slowly retarding the speed brakes, the airplane started to climb and the captain slowly lowered the nose of the airplane. The digital flight data recorder revealed that over a 30-second period the airplane's vertical acceleration decreased to 0.75 g, then increased to 2.33 g, decreased to 0.05 g, then stabilized at 0.9 g (normal). During the event, one passenger broke her femur; two cabin attendants and four passengers received minor injuries. The airplane was not damaged.  Convective activity was located immediately west of where the event occurred, likely blocking the wind flow and causing a wave-like disturbance downstream of the storms, which would result in unanticipated convectively induced turbulence. Since the event occurred in clear air downstream of the cumulonimbus clouds, the airplane likely encountered an undulating turbulence under a strong temperature inversion and strong windshear. The turbulence was not predicted by weather forecasters. Probable Cause: An encounter with unanticipated convectively induced windshear and turbulence during descent.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: WPR11LA139 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB WPR11LA139 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  9 February 2018 JA603J ?

There were 10 passengers and two crew members on board. Both crew members and four passengers were killed.  The airplane operated on Manx2 flight NM7100 from Belfast City Airport (BHD) to Cork Airport (ORK). Following a fuel uplift a total fuel quantity of 3000 lb (1360 kg) was recorded, which was sufficient for the planned round trip to Cork and back to Belfast. The flight plan specified Waterford Airport (EIWF) as the alternate for the sector to Cork. The accident flight took off from Belfast at 08:10 hrs, and climbed to Flight Level (FL) 120. The co-pilot was Pilot Flying (PF) with the commander acting as Pilot Non Flying (PNF).  At 08:48 the flight contacted Cork Approach Control. The Cork ATIS information stated that runway 35 was the active runway with Low Visibility Procedures (LVP) in operation. Cork Approach also informed the flight crew that runway 35 was the active runway with CAT II available for runway 17. The RVRs on runway 17 were passed by Cork Approach as 300 m (touchdown), 350 m (midpoint) and 550 m (stop-end) (300/350/550). Flight 7100 was given the choice of runways, and while runway 35 was initially considered by the flight crew, a decision was made to opt for an approach to runway 17. This was acknowledged by Cork Approach who stated ""...thatÂs copied, just check IRVRs Runway 17 for CAT II, currently at 350, 350, and 450.""  The aircraft first established on the ILS approach to runway 17 at 08:58 and was handed over to Cork Tower. The RVRs passed by Cork Tower at 09:00 hrs were 300/400/375. The approach was continued beyond the 3.5 nautical miles (nm) DME point (outer marker equivalent). A missed approach was carried out at 09:03 hrs, the lowest height recorded on this approach was 101 ft radio altitude. A second ILS approach was then flown, to the reciprocal direction runway 35, with the aircraft being handed over to Cork Tower at 09.10 at 8 nm from touchdown. At 09:10:56 the flight crew reported established on the ILS runway 35. The RVRs passed by the Tower at this time were 350/350/350. Descent was continued beyond the 4.9 nm DME point (outer marker equivalent). A missed approach was carried out at 09:14, the lowest height recorded on this approach was 91 ft radio altitude. At 09:15 hrs the flight crew requested to enter a holding pattern for 15 to 20 minutes to see if the weather would improve. The flight took up the holding pattern at point ROVAL maintaining an altitude of 3,000 ft. The flight crew requested the weather for Waterford. This weather, which was below minima, was provided by Cork Approach. The flight crew nominated Shannon Airport as their second alternate and requested weather information. Shannon weather was passed by Cork Approach, it was below minima. Weather for Dublin Airport was then sought by the flight crew. This was acknowledged by Cork Approach who offered to provide the weather for Kerry Airport also. The weather at Kerry was passed with the visibility being reported as greater than 10 kilometres. Weather conditions at Dublin, which were marginal, were obtained and passed to the flight crew at 09:35 hrs. At approximately 09:32 hrs, with EC-ITP still in the ROVAL hold, the RVR values on runway 17 at Cork began to improve. Following a further improvement to 500/450/400 at 09:39 hrs, the flight crew elected to attempt another approach to runway 17.  At 09:45 the aircraft reported established on the ILS, and was configured with landing gear down and 1/2 flaps selected. At 09:45:26, when EC-ITP was at 11 nm DME on the ILS, the RVR (touchdown) improved to 550 m, which was passed to the flight crew by Cork Approach. At 09:45:38, the flight was handed over to the Cork Tower and the flight crew reported to the Tower at 09:46:00 passing 9 nm DME. The final RVRs passed to EC-ITP at 09.46:15 were 500/400/400 when the aircraft was 9.6 nm from the threshold of runway 17. At approximately 400 ft radio altitude, recorded data shows the aircraft deviated to the right of the runway centreline, paralleling the centreline track. The descent was continued below Decision Height (DH). Power was reduced momentarily before being re-applied. Just below 100 ft radio altitude, a go-around was called by the PNF and was acknowledged by the PF.  Recorded data shows that the aircraft rolled significantly to the left as the aircraft tracked towards the runway centreline. This was immediately followed by a rapid roll to the right which brought the right wingtip into contact with the runway surface. Runway surface contact was made with a roll angle of 97 degrees to the right. The initial impact mark was located 86 m from the runway threshold, and 2 m left of the centreline.  The aircraft continued to roll rapidly to the right and struck the runway in the fully inverted position 25 m beyond the initial impact point. The inverted aircraft departed the runway surface on a heading of approximately 195Â° M and came to a rest 189 m from the initial impact point. The propeller blades on both engines were severely damaged; three of the four propeller blades on the right-hand engine detached during the inverted impact. Fire occurred in both engines post impact.  The AOC of the operator contained approval for the aircraft to operate CAT I approaches only. In this case a decision height of 200 feet at an RVR (touchdown) minimum of 550 m for runway 17 and 750 m for runway 35. The Investigation determined that the probable cause was ÂLoss of control during an attempted go-around initiated below Decision Height (200 feet) in Instrument Meteorological ConditionsÂ. The Investigation identified the following factors as being significant: - The approach was continued in conditions of poor visibility below those required. - The descent was continued below the Decision Height without adequate visual reference being acquired. - Uncoordinated operation of the flight and engine controls when go-around was attempted - The engine power-levers were retarded below the normal in-flight operational range, an action prohibited in flight. - A power difference between the engines became significant when the engine power levers were retarded below the normal in-flight range. - Tiredness and fatigue on the part of the Flight Crew members. - Inadequate command training and checking. - Inappropriate pairing of Flight Crew members, and - Inadequate oversight of the remote Operation by the Operator and the State of the Operator.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIU Report number: 2014-001 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) statement  Six killed as passenger plane crashes in fog at Cork airport (Irish Times, 10-2-2011)  Irish Examiner  SKYbraryÂ  History of this aircraft N3003T Fairchild Aircraft (registered, Oct 1991) XA-SES AÃ©romexico (delivered, Sep 1992) XA-SES Aerolitoral (leased, Sep 1992) ZS-PDW Norse Air Charter (Sep. 2003) EC-ITP Top Fly (registered, 22 Jan 2004) EC-ITP Top Fly (incident at Palma de Mallorcawhen it ran off the runway, 21 May 2004 ) EC-ITP LÃ­neas AÃ©reas de AndalucÃ­a (op. by Euro Continental Air, May 2008) EC-ITP Manx2 (leased, May 2008) EC-ITP Ibertour Servicios AÃ©reos (leased, Nov. 2009) EC-ITP Manx2 (leased, 2011) Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  21 May 2004 EC-ITP Top Fly 0 Palma de Mallorca Airport (PMI/LEPA) min Location  Images: photo (c) anon.; Cork Airport (ORK/EICK); 10 February 2011 photo (c) anon.; Cork Airport (ORK/EICK); 10 February 2011 photo (c) anon.; Cork Airport (ORK/EICK); 10 February 2011 photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Lanzarote Airport (ACE/GCRR); January 2007 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates17-Aug-2024 19:25 ASN Updated The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane incurred substantial left wing damage when the left main landing gear collapsed during the overrun.  The purpose of the flight was a test flight following the installation of the airplane's interior prior to delivery of the airplane to its owner. The flight departed from Appleton about 10:10. The flight returned about three hours later. While the airplane was inside the final approach fix, an amber left side hydraulic quantity low crew alerting system (CAS) message illuminated. The pilot flying (PF) noticed the hydraulic fluid quantity decreasing. Subsequently, an amber left hydraulic system fail CAS message appeared. The pilot not flying (PNF) pulled out the checklist to accomplish the left hydraulic system failure procedures and then suggested a go-around because the landing runway was about 500 feet shorter than the recommended minimum runway length indicated in the checklist. The PF decided to land due to the hydraulic quantity indications, prior autopilot problems, and the airplane's landing configuration. The PNF turned on the auxiliary pump about 500 feet above ground level, and both the PF and PNF thought the auxiliary hydraulic system could support normal spoilers, brakes, and nosewheel steering. The PF selected right thrust reverser aft and began pressing the brakes, but he felt no braking action. He reached for the emergency brakes; however, he did not immediately apply them to slow the airplane because he decided that there was not enough distance remaining to stop the airplane on the runway. Therefore, he attempted to go around with insufficient runway remaining by advancing the throttles to the maximum continuous thrust setting. The PNF did not see the airspeed increase and believed that not enough runway remained to get airborne, so he pulled the throttles back to avoid a runway overrun. The airplane exited the runway and sustained substantial damage. A review of the cockpit voice recorder transcript indicated that, before the emergency, the flight crew did not maintain a disciplined cockpit environment that focused on operationally relevant discussion but instead repeatedly made reference to and discussed objects on the ground and other operationally irrelevant topics. The lack of a sterile cockpit did not promote crew coordination and communication and adherence to procedures, which would have helped mitigate this emergency. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The pilot flying's (PF) decision to land on a shorter-than-recommended runway with a known left hydraulic system failure rather than go around as suggested by the pilot-not-flying, his failure to immediately apply emergency brakes following the detection of the lack of normal brakes, and his attempt to go around late in the landing roll with insufficient runway remaining. Contributing to the accident was the nose landing gear swivel assembly failure, the lack of a hydraulic fuse before this critical failure point, and the design of the swivel using two similar alloys with a propensity to adhere to each other when rubbed together. Also contributing to the accident was the lack of a disciplined cockpit environment.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN11FA193 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) Holm; Stockholm-Arlanda Airport (ARN/ESSA); 13 June 2017 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All 12 passengers and two crew members on board were killed. The airplane operated on Central American Airways flight 731 from San Pedro Sula (SAP) to Tegucigalpa (TGU). The flight had departed San Pedro Sula at 07:04 for the forty minute flight to Tegucigalpa. The pilot flying deviated from the airways without clearance from air traffic control. At 07:34 the controller at Toncontin Airport cleared the flight direct to the 15 DME fix (final approach fix) for a VOR/DME approach to runway 20 and to descend to 9000 feet. At 07:51 the fight reported that they were performing a missed approach, after which the flight was cleared for a VOR/DME approach to runway 02. The airplane was lined up with runway 02 and descending with full flaps, when at about 12 km from the runway the airplane stalled. The descent could not be arrested and the airplane impacted a wooded hillside at an elevation of 5412 ft. PROBABLE CAUSES (translated from original Spanish language report):  1) Weather conditions existing at the time of the event, during the approach to the runway the aircraft was operated slightly above the stall speed and a major change in wind speed could cause a stall. The altitude at which the windshear occured, and the reaction time of the pilot and the responsiveness of the aircraft determined whether the descent could be arrested in time to avoid an accident.  2) No published descent procedures were performed, possibly misinterpretation of Flight Instruments (altimeter, airspeed indicator).  3) During the descent to the VOR/DME for runway 20 and 02, the pilot in command (PIC) did not check his approach chart, and did not continually consult the first officer on the altitude and course.  4) There was no adequate communication between crew; deficient CRM (No approach briefing was made for any of the two approaches).  5) The aircraft was configured for landing with flaps fully down (flap 42) at a very long distance from the track without having it in sight. It is noteworthy that the aircraft will not respond to an adverse condition windshear as it appeared at that time with such a configuration. It should be noted that in both approaches it is mandatory to perdorm a ""circuling"" procedure.METAR: 14:00 UTC / 08:00 local time: MHTG 141400Z 36009KT 5000 VCSH FEW007 BKN020 17/14 Q1022 A3018 NOSIG=Wind 360 degrees at 9 knots; Visibility 5000m; Showers in the vicinity; Few clouds 700 ft., broken clouds 2,000 ft.; Temperature 17Â°C; Dew point 14Â°C; 1022 hPaAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIAA Honduras Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: El Tiempo  La Tribuna  Confirmado: Catorce personas fallecieron en accidente de aviaciÃ³n en Las Mesitas (Proceso, 14-2-2011)   Location  Images: photo (c) Nelson Mejia; San Pedro Sula-Ramon Villeda Morales Airport (SAP/MHLM); 31 August 2010 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane operated on a flight from Grenchen Airport. Destination of the ferry flight was Newquay-Cornwall Airport (NQY) in England. The co-pilot was pilot flying (PF) and the commander was pilot not flying (PNF). HB-VOV left stand ""white alpha"" at 08:48 LT. The crew had previously received the necessary clearance to take off from runway 07 after a request to Grenchen aerodrome control (tower). The de-icing system was switched on from the outset in view of the prevailing conditions. The taxi checklist was completed on the short route to the runway 07 holding position via taxiway WHISKEY. This included, among other things, testing the functionality of the brakes, which was carried out by both crew members. No anomalies were found. At approximately the same time, the Grenchen aerodrome control air traffic control officer (ATCO) arranged for a runway inspection, as visibility did not allow a view from the tower to the end of runway 07.  After receiving clearance at 08:51 LT, the commander steered the aircraft onto runway 07 and initially turned west, in order to have the maximum runway length available for the subsequent takeoff (backtrack). After a further 180 degree clockwise turn, HB-VOV was positioned just north of the runway centerline, pointing to the east. To take advantage of the available runway length, the commander, according to his own statements, did not manoeuvre the aircraft precisely onto the runway centerline. Runway 07 has a takeoff run available (TORA) of 3281 ft (1000 m). The ATCO observed HB-VOV taxiing onto the runway and instructed the crew to hold on the runway, as a runway inspection was still in progress. In view of the expected delay, the commander then set the parking brake. At 08:53:43 LT, the crew of HB-VOV received takeoff clearance: ""Hotel Oscar Victor, wind zero six zero degrees six knots, runway zero seven, cleared for takeoff"". The commander then switched on the pitot heater and landing lights, pushed the thrust levers forward and handed control over to the copilot. He instructed the copilot, in view of the reduced visibility, to carry out a so-called standing takeoff. At a power setting with a low-pressure compressor speed N1 of approximately 90% of the rated speed the copilot took his feet off the brake pedals, set takeoff thrust and steered the aircraft on the runway centerline. The set takeoff thrust was checked by both crew members. The ATCO watched the HB-VOV takeoff roll and noticed slower acceleration than usual.  After checking the takeoff thrust and the speed indications at the beginning of the takeoff roll, the commander had the impression that the aircraft's acceleration was lower than usual. HB-VOV attained a speed of 80 kt before taxiway ECHO 1, i.e. rather late, but still within a framework which seemed acceptable to the commander. On reaching rotation speed (VR), in the co-pilot's estimation approximately 250 m before the end of the runway, the commander called out ""rotate"", whereupon the copilot pulled on the control column. Both crew members immediately noticed that the nose of the aircraft was not lifting. After a repeated callout by the commander, he too pulled on the control column. On overshooting the end of the runway, the right main landing gear of HB-VOV struck a ""end-of-runway"" light, which was perceived by the crew as a distinctly noticeable impact. On the transition from the runway to the grass, the copilot, according to his statement, had the feeling that it was no longer possible to continue the takeoff and briefly reduced power. But at approximately the same time, the copilot noted that HB-VOV had already lifted off and applied full power again. At the same time, he asked the commander whether the takeoff process should continue. The latter answered the copilot's question in the affirmative, with the consideration that they would perhaps still have a chance to get the aircraft into the air. The events from overshooting the end of the runway to lift-off of HB-VOV, after a roll of more than 100 metres in the adjacent meadow, occurred within a few seconds. In the process the aircraft crossed a small stream bed running perpendicular to the runway. Once the aircraft had attained the normal attitude for a climb at the appropriate takeoff safety speed V2, the commander reduced power to maximum continuous thrust (MCT) and retracted the flaps. Then the crew realised that the parking brake was still set. The commander retracted the landing gear and detected that the red warning light did not go out. He instructed the copilot to keep the speed low and extended the gear again. All three landing gear indicators indicated green. At an altitude of approximately 3500 ft AMSL, HB-VOV was transferred to Berne arrival air traffic control. As part of the climb check, the de-icing system was switched off again. The crew subsequently decided to make an alternate landing at Zurich airport. The crew did not declare an emergency and did not apply for landing priority. According to the landing gear indicators in the cockpit, the crew assumed that the landing gear was extended and locked. For this reason they did not make a low pass at Zurich airport for an external visual check of the landing gear. After the approach and landing, HB-VOV exited runway 14 at the end via taxiway HOTEL 3. The crew then waived a visual check and taxied the aircraft directly to the stand on the apron near the General Aviation Centre (GAC). As a result of the collision of the right main landing gear of HB-VOV with the endof-runway light and the subsequent crossing of the stream bed, structural damage was found in the area of the nose gear and main gear, as well as to both rear wing spars. Also, a certain asymmetry was ascertained in the dimensions of the aircraft. The two pilots were uninjured in the accident. CAUSES: The accident is attributable to a collision with obstacles beyond the end of the runway, because the aircraft did not achieve the expected acceleration during the take-off roll and because the take-off roll was nevertheless continued. The following causal factors were identified: - reduced acceleration of the aircraft during take-off because of the set parking brake. - the missing decision of the crew to respond to the reduced acceleration by aborting the take-off. The fact that the aircraft had no warning device to indicate a set parking brake when the take-off roll is initiated contributed to the accident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: SUST Report number: Nr. 2156 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane operated on a domestic flight from BelÃ©m/Val-de-CÃ£es International Airport.  The approach for landing was visual and stabilized. The touchdown on runway 25 was smooth, with gradual deceleration, in which only ground idle power was utilized. After the 70kt callout, a strong noise was heard, and the left main gear collapsed, with the aircraft veering off to the left. The aircraft exited the runway and came to a stop in a grass area. Contributing factors 1 Human Factor 1.1 Medical aspect Nil. 1.2 Psychological aspect Nil. 1.2.2 Psychosocial information Nil. 1.2.3 Organizational information a) Capacitation - a contributor The lack of capacitation and training of the subcontractorsÂ professionals for handling aircraft material hindered the execution of an efficient maintenance work as prescribed by the manufacturer's manual, culminating in inadequate machining during the maintenance process. b) Organizational Processes - a contributor The lack of an effective process of supervision, both on the part of TRIP Linhas AÃ©reas and on the part of the other contractors and subcontractors allowed the existing maintenance servicesÂ latent failures not to be checked and corrected, in a way capable of subsidizing, in an adequate and safe manner, the execution of the landing gear maintenance service The process of supervision of the TRIP Linhas AÃ©reas and the AV IndÃºstria AeronÃ¡utica Ltda. companies by the Civil Aviation Authority, prescribed by specific legislation in force, was not enough to mitigate the latent conditions present in the accident in question. 2 Operational Factor 2.1 Concerning the operation of the aircraft a) Aircraft maintenance - a contributor According to the technical opinion issued by the DCTA, the AFT PIVOT PIN (D61000 and SN 25) presented fracture surfaces with Â± 45Âº inclination, as well as a flat area with multiple initiations, indicative of a fracture mechanism related to fatigue. In examinations of the external surface of the pin, in a region close to the fatigue fracture, cracks were observed that had initiated from scratches created by an inadequate maintenance machining process. In the region where the overload-related fracture occurred, it was also possible to identify that the machining process had modified the profile of the part in the section transition region, by producing a depression. Thus, it can be said that the AFT PIVOT PIN (D61000 and SN 25) of the PR-TTI left main gear broke on account of fatigue, whose onset was facilitated by an inadequate machining process that had been performed in the section transition region of the pin. 3 Material Factor Not a contributor.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CENIPA Report number: A - 012/CENIPA/2013 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Pista de Aeroporto de Altamira segue parcialmente interditada (G1)  REGISTRO FOTOGRÃFICO DO ACIDENTE COM AVIÃO DA TRIP EM ALTAMIRA (SBHT)   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight crew, therefore, advised the passengers and the flight attendants that the descent would be bumpy and then advised the flight attendants that all descent and before-landing cabin securing activities should be completed about 10 minutes earlier than normal. Before the descent, the flight crew turned on the seatbelt sign and upon reaching 25,000 feet, the flying pilot began reducing the airspeed to that prescribed for turbulence penetration. As the airplane passed through 24,000 feet (4,000 feet higher than the altitude of the turbulence noted in the pilot report), three flight attendants were just finishing their activities, and the airplane suddenly encountered moderate turbulence for about 30 seconds. Due to the sudden movement of the airplane, the one remaining standing passenger and two of the flight attendants were thrown to the floor, one of whom sustained multiple bone fractures in her right foot.

None of the eleven occupants were injured. The airplane operated on scheduled flight M3990 from OLA (Ãrland) to OSL. During roll-out following a normal landing, when the aircraft's speed had decreased to less than 60 kt, the aircraft started an uncommanded turn to the right. The nose wheel steering system was activated. The course could not be corrected, and the aircraft veered off the side of the runway where it became stuck in hard-packed snow one meter deep. The investigation has shown that the loss of control was most likely caused by a fault in the nose wheel steering. The same problem had occurred six days earlier, but the commander then managed to disconnect the nose wheel steering in time and regained control. The fault could not be reproduced, and the aircraft was released to service after inspection and testing without remarks. The nose wheel steering system on this aircraft type is relatively complex, and over time several improvements have been made to improve its reliability. The Flight Manual has a caution related to activation of nose wheel steering at speeds higher than normal taxi speed. There was some freezing rain/freezing fog at the time of the accident. Comprehensive technical examination of the nose wheel steering on OY-NPB uncovered no single causal factor, but some indications of unsatisfactory maintenance. Irregularities that alone or in combination could have caused a temporary fault with the steering were present. The Accident Investigation Board believes that a temporary fault caused the nose wheel to unintentionally lock itself in a position towards the right. No other defects or irregularities that could explain why the aircraft veered off the runway were found.METAR: 02:41 UTC /  local time: 280241Z 19003KT 7000 FEW009 BKN025 M05/M06 Q1027Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIBN Report number: SL 2012/06 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: AIBN Norway   Location  Images: photo (c) AIBN; Oslo-Gardermoen Airport (OSL); 02 March 2011; (publicdomain) photo (c) Allan J.

The reported weather was visibility of 3/4 mile in mist and an indefinite ceiling at 200 feet. The operator reported that there was no mechanical malfunction or failure of the airplane that would have precluded normal operation. Both pilots were likely influenced by the mission pressure to land because of medical considerations for a passenger on board.

All 31 passengers and three crew members survived. The airplane operated on a flight from ReykjavÃ­k Domestic Airport (RKV), Iceland to GodthÃ¥b/Nuuk Airport (GOH), Greenland with an enroute stop at Kulusuk. At 12:58, the flight crew of TF-JMB made radio contact with Nuuk AFIS and were informed that the runway in use was 23. The weather was reported to be: wind direction from 170Â° at a speed of 24 kts with a maximum of 43 kts, the visibility was 4,000 meters in light snow, moderate blowing snow, a few clouds at 1,800 feet, broken clouds at 3,500 feet, the temperature was zero, the dew point was minus four Celsius and the QNH was 1014 hPa.  The flight crew made visual contact with the runway and decided to deviate to the right (west) of the offset Localizer (LLZ) to runway 23. The flight continued towards the runway from a position right of the runway centerline. The flight crew was aiming to land the aircraft at a point between the runway threshold and the touchdown zone.  As the aircraft approached runway 23 it was still in the final right turn over the landing threshold. The aircraft touched down on runway 23 between the runway threshold and the touchdown zone and to the left of the runway centerline. The Flight Data Recorder (FDR) data indicated that the aircraft was banking more than 11Â° to the right as the aircraft touched down. At the same time the vertical acceleration was approximately 3.9 G and the rate of descent was greater than 13 feet per second. The right main landing gear (MLG) shock strut fuse pin sheared and the right MLG collapsed, the aircraft skidded down the runway and departed the runway to the right. The nose landing gear was separated from the aircraft as the aircraft was entering the unpaved surface. The aircraft came to rest in the rocky area to the right of runway 23. Adverse wind and turbulence conditions at BGGH led to flight crew task saturation on final approach and a breakdown of optimum cockpit resource management (CRM) resulting in a divergence from the operatorÂs stabilized approach policy. The divergence from the operatorÂs stabilized approach policy caused an unstabilized approach and a hard landing leading to an excess load of the right MLG at touchdown.

The intended destination of the flight was Canouan (TVSC) in the Grenadine Islands but the pilot landed instead at Union Island (TVSU), some eight miles to the south of Canouan Island. In his report, the pilot stated that the ADF (Automatic Direction Finder) on board the aircraft was unserviceable and that they were navigating using the GPS and visual reference. On seeing Union Island, he assumed that it was Canouan and did not confirm this with the GPS distance. On seeing the high terrain to the west of the airport in Union Island the pilot decided to land from the east; hence his request to the Canouan ATC (STSC) to land on Runway 31. It was not until the aircraft was on short final approach that the pilots observed that the runway was 26 (the runway heading in Union Island (TVSU)) and not Runway 31 (the runway heading in Canouan TVSC)). The captain stated in his report that at this point, he did not believe that it was possible to execute a go-around due to the hills in his flight path. As a result of landing on the reduced runway length available at Union Island (TVSU), in addition to the tailwind component of approximately 10 kts, the aircraft was unable to stop and having veered off to the left, came to rest on the southern side of the end of Runway 26 striking the perimeter fence. CONCLUSIONS: Although the incorrect call sign (YV-192T instead of YV-196T) was consistently used by all of the Air Traffic Controllers, it does not appear to have contributed to the aircraft landing at the incorrect airport. The captain of the aircraft was not fluent in English and did not have an endorsement for English Language Proficiency on his licence. The Co-pilot had a level 4 endorsement. This lack of English Language Proficiency by the crew, particularly by the captain was, in the opinion of the investigators, a significant contributing factor in the aircraft landing at the wrong destination and therefore a major contributor to the accident. The Air Traffic Controller at Canouan (TVSC) issued landing clearance to the aircraft in spite of the fact that he did not observe the aircraft on when the pilot reported on final approach. The controller, in his report, stated that he found it strange that the pilot was requesting Runway 31 although the wind was favouring Runway 13. This coupled with the poor English Language Proficiency of the pilot should have caused him to be more vigilant prior to issuing landing clearance. The captain stated in his report that he did not observe the numbers on Runway 26 in Union Island until he was on short final. At that point, he decided that it was possible to execute a go- around due to the high terrain to the west of the runway and landed. The investigation revealed that the aircraftÂs performance was such that it could have executed a go-around up to the point of the threshold of Runway 26 in Union Island, by executing a turn to the south.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ECCAA Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: http://www.jeremietronet.com/unions-island-kiting-fishing-surfing-and-plane-crash/  https://whatsupcaribbean.wordpress.com/2011/03/06/plane-crash-in-union-islandupdated/  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane turned right and then left without experiencing any anomalies. The pilot then applied full right rudder and brake pressure to negotiate the last 90-degree turn; however, the airplane did not turn as expected and subsequently impacted two trucks and a van. A witness reported that the airplane's taxi speed appeared normal throughout its approach and final turn. The examination of the accident master brake cylinders and the cylinders from two other airplanes that had reportedly failed revealed several anomalies that could have caused or contributed to the airplane's failure to turn as expected. The examination revealed that the right pedal assembly may interfere with the adjacent floorboard when the brake pedal is compressed to or near the full-internal cylinder travel stop, which may cause an additional stop and limit the overall travel of the cylinder. The examination also revealed that numerous components or items may prevent the master brake cylinders from fully extending after the brakes are released and adequate travel (reduced pressure) when the brakes are subsequently actuated. Additionally, the examination revealed that the brake fluid may bypass the piston O-ring or Stat-O-Seal if parts are damaged or excessively worn. The cylinder manufacturer, in conjunction with the FAA, published Service Bulletin CAB-32-01, Revision 1, to address the noted mechanical anomalies. Probable Cause: The malfunction of a master brake cylinder, which resulted in a loss of braking action and subsequent loss of directional control and collision with three vehicles during taxi. Contributing to the accident was the inappropriate design and manufacture of the master brake cylinders.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: WPR11FA158 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  FAA register:  2.

The commercial pilot, the sole occupant of the airplane, was not injured.  The pilot reported that following two attempts to land in crosswind conditions, he was cleared to land and was instructed by the air traffic control tower controller to follow another airplane on final approach. For spacing considerations, the controller instructed the pilot to conduct ""S"" turns behind the traffic landing ahead of him. As the airplane descended to an altitude of about 200 feet above ground level, the controller instructed the pilot to go around and maintain altitude. The pilot executed a go-around procedure, which included retracting the landing gear and reducing the flap setting to one-half flaps. Shortly after, the pilot was issued a clearance to land. The pilot proceeded with the landing clearance and subsequently landed with the gear in the retracted position, which resulted in structural damage to the airframe.

There were no injuries, and aircraft damage was limited to the nose and main landing gear, which was subsequently replaced. The flight departed Long Beach, CA (LGB) en route to Milan, Italy, with a planned fuel stop in Iqaluit (YFB), Canada. The flight time to Iqaluit was 5 hours and 36 minutes at a cruise altitude of 41 000 feet. The flight en route was uneventful; the outside temperature at the cruising altitude was approximately -60Â°C. The first officer was the pilot flying. An ILS/DME approach to runway 35 at Iqaluit was carried out with the autopilot on. The reported surface winds were within the aircraft limitations for a right crosswind with a light tailwind component. A reference speed (VREF) of 114 knots was calculated. The before-landing checklist items were completed 3 miles prior to the final approach fix. The autopilot was disconnected, and the aircraft crossed the threshold at a speed of about 118 knots. The aircraft touched down approximately 10 feet to the right of the centreline at 21:00. Once the nose wheel contacted the runway, the aircraft veered to the right. The crew applied full left rudder and left brake while selecting left nose steering with the tiller. Thrust reversers were also selected, but the aircraft continued to pull to the right. The aircraft departed the runway 4300 feet from the threshold and came to rest in packed snow 100 feet from the runway edge lights. The nose landing gear (NLG) came to rest in snow reaching the top of the wheel height, and the main landing gear (MLG) came to rest in snow reaching half the wheel height. Findings as to causes and contributing factors: 1. On touchdown, the nose wheel veered to the right, and the crewÂs attempt to control the uncommanded veer was not successful. 2. The electro hydraulic servo valve did not respond to steering commands, and the steering control unit logic commanded the steering selector valve to close. The steering selector valve did not close, and this condition prevented the nose-wheel steering system from free castering with the steering pointing to the right. 3. The electro hydraulic servo valve likely failed due to contamination, internal corrosion and exposure to cold temperatures. Findings as to risk: 1. If aircraft components have a lengthy time limit of operation without an accompanying periodic maintenance schedule, and component service history is not regularly reviewed, there is an increased risk of an unexpected component failure. 2. If cockpit voice recordings are not available to an investigation, this may preclude the identification and communication of safety deficiencies to advance transportation safety.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A11Q0052 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  16 October 2013 N818RC Tri Marine Logistics LLC 0 Biak-Frans Kaisiepo Airport (BIK/WABB) unk Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

During roll-out the aircraft collided with a de-icing truck parked on the runway, in front of the displaced threshold 08. Causes: The accident is attributable to the fact that a landing was carried out even though at that time a vehicle was still on the runway. This meant that the aircraft, in the course of its landing roll, collided with this vehicle. The following factors contributed to the accident: - The excessively high approach speed on final approach led to an increased landing distance. - The pilot had had little actual training on the aircraft type involved in the accident and in operation on short runways. The identified systemic cause was a runway occupancy concept which had safety deficiencies in various respects.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: STSB Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The commercial pilot and four passengers were fatally injured; a fifth passenger was seriously injured. The airplane was destroyed. Witnesses reported that the airplaneÂs takeoff ground roll appeared to be normal. Shortly after the airplane lifted off, it stopped climbing and yawed to the left. Several witnesses heard abnormal sounds, which they attributed to propeller blade angle changes. The airplaneÂs flight path deteriorated to a left skid and its airspeed began to slow. The airplaneÂs left bank angle increased to between 45 and 90 degrees, and its nose dropped to a nearly vertical attitude. Just before impact, the airplaneÂs bank angle and pitch began to flatten out.

The captain was the pilot flying and the takeoff, climb and cruise portion of the flight was uneventful. Prior to landing, the captain conducted the approach briefing, indicating that they would conduct a visual approach to runway 26, the gusty winds required a wind additive to the approach speed and would go-around if the approach was not stabilized. On final approach, the local controller cleared the flight to land and reported the winds were 310 degrees at 16 knots. The flight crew stated that at 1000 feet AGL the landing checklist was complete, the airplane was fully configured for landing and the approach speed was set to 132 knots (Vref + 5).  Recorder data indicated that during the final approach, the autothrottle was disconnected about 800 feet above the ground and the airspeed decreased to as low as 129 knots but did not go below Vref (127 knots). The first officer (FO) stated that he called out the low airspeed and adjusted the target airspeed from 132 to 134 knots. The captain increased power during the approach but the airspeed remained slightly below Vapp until landing. Pitch attitude on final approach was stable at about 5 to 6 degrees nose up. The pitch attitude at touchdown was about 7 degrees and the airplane touched down first on the right main landing gear (MLG) and then on the left MLG. The flight crew stated that they felt that the airplane bounced and both called for a go around simultaneously. About one second after the initial touchdown, the ground spoilers began to deploy, followed by an increase in pitch in the next two seconds from 4.2 degrees to 12.7 degrees. Thrust levers advanced to near maximum thrust about one second after the left MLG touched down and as the ground spoilers were in transit. Pitch attitude continued to increase to more than 14 degrees while the airplane was still on the ground. Neither flight crewmember was aware of a tail strike until the captain discovered damage to the airplane during the post flight inspection. The tail strike resulted in aft fuselage skin cracks and numerous sheared rivets, internal structural damage to the frames, a cracked support bracket, buckled floor beam, buckled main cargo deck floor panels, and buckled stringers.

The captain, first officer, and sole passenger were not injured.  The captain was the pilot-flying during the accident flight. After departure, the flight had to circumnavigate around numerous thunderstorms that affected the planned route of flight. When the flight was within 25 nautical miles (nm) of its intended destination, the flight crew cancelled the instrument flight plan and concluded the flight under visual flight rules.  The captain noted the wind was from 310 degrees at 19 knots, gusting 27 knots. A 5 nm straight-in final approach was flown to runway 36 (5,500 feet by 100 feet). The captain reported that the landing reference speed (Vref) was 110 knots, which included a 5 knot gust factor. As the airplane touched down on its main landing gear, it encountered a wind gust that raised the left wing. The captain corrected with a left roll input as he simultaneously reduced the airplane's pitch in an attempt to place the nose wheel onto the runway, but the airplane became airborne and drifted off the runway. The airplane touched down for the second time in the grassy area alongside the runway where the subsequent landing roll was completed without further incident. The captain reported that there were no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation of the airplane. A postaccident examination of the airframe revealed that the right main landing gear had shifted/twisted inside the wheel well damaging both forward and aft spar assemblies. Additionally, the aft movement of the nose landing gear had damaged the forward pressure bulkhead. Both engines appeared to have ingested foreign object debris past their first compressor stages.

One of the three crew members was killed. The airplane departed Saskatoon Airport, SK (YXE) at 15:03 for a geophysical survey flight to the east of Saskatoon.  At about 18:14 the aircraft experienced a shudder from the right engine just before it smoothly spooled down. The propeller rotation slowed and the aircraft yawed. The right engine torque fell below 20%. The crew confirmed that the right engine had lost power. Altitude at the time was 2300 feet and the 2 survey sensors were deployed behind and below the aircraft. The captain set maximum power on the left engine and the crew commenced to shut down the right hand engine. As the first officer had more experience on the aircraft than the captain, the pilots agreed to let the FO continue as pilot flying. The captain would continue with the checklists and radio communications. At 18:17 the captain notified the Saskatoon control tower of the situation with a MAYDAY call, advising they had lost power on one engine and were returning to Saskatoon.  By 18:18, the aircraft had climbed to 2600 feet asl and accelerated to about 99 KIAS, and the pilots had instructed the survey equipment operator to recover the survey sensors. The survey equipment operator got up to do so. The recovery process took 4 to 5 minutes. At 18:25, the flight reached 3100 feet asl (about 1400 agl), the maximum altitude following the right engine power loss. By 18:27, airspeed was about 105 to 110 KIAS, and both pilots had visual contact with the runway. The FO's plan was to fly a high steep approach, and he had not yet reduced the left engine power lever setting for the approach. The tower cleared the flight to land on runway 27. Meanwhile the fuel level left tank or fuel pressure left engine annunciators had illuminated, along with the master caution light. Neither pilot observed these annunciations. At about 18:28, airspeed was 105 KIAS or greater when the left engine smoothly lost power with no surging. The captain observed the torque indicator smoothly and rapidly decreasing from 100% to 20% within a couple of seconds. The airplane decelerated and yawed to the left. The altitude was 3000 feet asl (about 1300 feet agl).  Both pilots immediately concluded the flight would not reach the runway, and the captain pointed out a large street to the FO as a feasible forced landing site and the FO concurred. Neither pilot could see any better alternative. The left hand prop was then feathered. The FO maintained control of the aircraft throughout the descent. Airspeed slowed initially to 100 KIAS and later to 90 KIAS. The goal was to control the descent and impact, with a minimum airspeed of 90 KIAS to prevent a departure from controlled flight.  The pilots observed traffic on the road. They revised the intended touchdown site to the grass beside 51st Street, to the right of the traffic and light poles and the left of what they perceived as a frangible fence. Late in the descent the pilots identified that the fence was actually a noise abatement wall. The FO concluded that the flight could not be extended beyond the noise abatement wall and advised the other crew members. The aircraft landed astride the wall at 90 KIAS. When the aircraft came to a stop, the captain turned off the batteries and the master switch and pressed the cockpit engine fire extinguisher buttons. FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS 1. The right engine lost power when the intermediate spur gear on the torque sensor shaft failed. This resulted in loss of drive to the high-pressure engine-driven pump, fuel starvation, and immediate engine stoppage. 2. The ability of the left-hand No. 2 ejector pump to deliver fuel to the collector tank was compromised by foreign object debris (FOD) in the ejector pump nozzle. 3. When the fuel level in the left collector tank decreased, the left fuel level warning light likely illuminated but was not noticed by the crew. 4. The pilots did not execute the fuel level warning checklist because they did not perceive the illumination of the fuel level left tank warning light. Consequently, the fuel crossfeed valve remained closed and fuel from only the left wing was being supplied to the left engine. 5. The left engine flamed out as a result of depletion of the collector tank and fuel starvation, and the crew had to make a forced landing resulting in an impact with a concrete noise abatement wall.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A11C0047 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Plane crashes in Saskatoon, kills 1 (CBC)  Transport Canada - CADORS 2011C1061   Location  Images: photo (c) Rene Lavallee; Saskatoon Airport, SK; 02 April 2011 photo (c) Rene Lavallee; Saskatoon Airport, SK; 02 April 2011 photo (c) Rene Lavallee; Saskatoon Airport, SK; 02 April 2011 photo (c) Rene Lavallee; Saskatoon Airport, SK; 02 April 2011 photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Pickle Lake Airport, ON (YPL/CYPL); July 2001 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

They also noted, after landing, that there was a burning smell. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed fire damage to the aft equipment bay in the area of the right pylon directly above the auxiliary power unit (APU) exhaust duct.  There was evidence of chaffing on the right integrated drive generator (IDG) power feeder cable as well as damage to an adjacent hydraulic line.  Additionally, two support brackets, designed to secure the hydraulic line to the aft fuselage, near the area of the fire had fractured, with one bracket no longer attached to the fuselage. Consistent with the chafing, there was a pin-sized hole near the end of the hydraulic line where it connected to a fitting that was mounted on a bracket attaching the line to the airplane's structure. The pin-sized hole was near the chafed IDG cable strand, and about 0.0625 inches from the hydraulic line, instead of the required minimum distance of 2.0 inches specified in Bombardier wiring installation specifications. NTSB Metallurgical examinations of the IDG power feeder cable revealed that the damage to the insulation around the pin-sized hole was consistent with chafing.  The examination also found material splatter consistent with electrical arcing of the conductors. The damaged area of the hydraulic line revealed evidence of splattering and material expulsion consistent with electrical arcing against the hydraulic line's external surface. Additionally, the chaffed wire and hydraulic line were examined using energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) to determine if any material transfer consistent with an electrical arcing event, had occurred and the wire and the hydraulic line both had chemical elements not normally found in each. The bracket had fractured into two pieces, and one of the tabs matched the fracture on the main body of the bracket. There was fretting wear damage on the surface of the tab where it was attached to another surface indicative of the tab possibly having rubbed against a bolt or pin used to mount the bracket, and the fracture surface exhibited dimpled ductile fracture that is indicative of overstress bending. As a result of the findings from this accident, both Transport Canada and the FAA released Airworthiness Directives. Probable Cause: inadequate clearance between the Integrated Drive Generator (IDG) power cables and hydraulic lines in the aft equipment bay that resulted in chaffing of the IDG power cables and hydraulic lines, arcing, and fire.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA11FA072 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 years Download report:  Final report Sources: NTSB History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  13 June 2007 N7264V Mesa Airlines 0 Phoenix, AZ non Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates18-Apr-2020 08:54 ASN Update Bot Added 18-Apr-2020 09:44 harro Updated [Aircraft type, Operator, Nature, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The two pilots and the two flight test engineers were fatally injured. The accident occurred during a planned one-engine-inoperative (OEI) takeoff when a stall on the right outboard wing produced a rolling moment that the flight crew was not able to control, which led to the right wingtip contacting the runway and the airplane departing the runway from the right side. After departing the runway, the airplane impacted a concrete structure and an airport weather station, resulting in extensive structural damage and a postcrash fire that completely consumed the fuselage and cabin interior. The National Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB) investigation of this accident found that the airplane stalled while lifting off the ground. As a result, the NTSB examined the role of ""ground effect"" on the airplane's performance. Ground effect refers to changes in the airflow over the airplane resulting from the proximity of the airplane to the ground. Ground effect results in increased lift and reduced drag at a given angle of attack (AOA) as well as a reduction in the stall AOA. In preparing for the G650 field performance flight tests, Gulfstream considered ground effect when predicting the airplane's takeoff performance capability but overestimated the in ground effect stall AOA. Consequently, the airplane's AOA threshold for stick shaker (stall warning) activation and the corresponding pitch limit indicator (on the primary flight display) were set too high, and the flight crew received no tactile or visual warning before the actual stall occurred. The accident flight was the third time that a right outboard wing stall occurred during G650 flight testing. Gulfstream did not determine (until after the accident) that the cause of two previous uncommanded roll events was a stall of the right outboard wing at a lower-than-expected AOA. (Similar to the accident circumstances, the two previous events occurred during liftoff; however, the right wingtip did not contact the runway during either of these events.) If Gulfstream had performed an in-depth aerodynamic analysis of these events shortly after they occurred, the company could have recognized before the accident that the actual in-ground-effect stall AOA was lower than predicted. During field performance testing before the accident, the G650 consistently exceeded target takeoff safety speeds (V2). V2 is the speed that an airplane attains at or before a height above the ground of 35 feet with one engine inoperative. Gulfstream needed to resolve these V2 exceedances because achieving the planned V2 speeds was necessary to maintain the airplane's 6,000-foot takeoff performance guarantee (at standard sea level conditions). If the G650 did not meet this takeoff performance guarantee, then the airplane could only operate on longer runways. However, a key assumption that Gulfstream used to develop takeoff speeds was flawed and resulted in V2 speeds that were too low and takeoff distances that were longer than anticipated. Rather than determining the root cause for the V2 exceedance problem, Gulfstream attempted to reduce the V2 speeds and the takeoff distances by modifying the piloting technique used to rotate the airplane for takeoff. Further, Gulfstream did not validate the speeds using a simulation or physics-based dynamic analysis before or during field performance testing. If the company had done so, then it could have recognized that the target V2 speeds could not be achieved even with the modified piloting technique. In addition, the difficulties in achieving the target V2 speeds were exacerbated in late March 2011 when the company reduced the target pitch angle for some takeoff tests without an accompanying increase in the takeoff speeds. Gulfstream maintained an aggressive schedule for the G650 flight test program so that the company could obtain Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) type certification by the third quarter of 2011. The schedule pressure, combined with inadequately developed organizational processes for technical oversight and safety management, led to a strong focus on keeping the program moving and a reluctance to challenge key assumptions and highlight anomalous airplane behavior during tests that could slow the pace of the program. These factors likely contributed to key errors, including the development of unachievable takeoff speeds, as well as the superficial review of the two previous uncommanded roll events, which allowed the company's overestimation of the in-ground-effect stall AOA to remain undetected. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the cause of this accident was an aerodynamic stall and subsequent uncommanded roll during a one engine-inoperative takeoff flight test, which were the result of (1) Gulfstream's failure to properly develop and validate takeoff speeds for the flight tests and recognize and correct the takeoff safety speed (V2) error during previous G650 flight tests, (2) the G650 flight test team's persistent and increasingly aggressive attempts to achieve V2 speeds that were erroneously low, and (3) Gulfstream's inadequate investigation of previous G650 uncommanded roll events, which indicated that the company's estimated stall angle of attack while the airplane was in ground effect was too high. Contributing to the accident was Gulfstream's failure to effectively manage the G650 flight test program by pursuing an aggressive program schedule without ensuring that the roles and responsibilities of team members had been appropriately defined and implemented, engineering processes had received sufficient technical planning and oversight, potential hazards had been fully identified, and appropriate risk controls had been implemented and were functioning as intended.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NTSB/AAR-12/02 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Channel Six News  Gulfstream statement  NTSB  SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Roswell International Air Center Airport, NM (ROW/KROW); 03 April 2011 photo (c) NTSB; Roswell International Air Center Airport, NM (ROW/KROW); 03 April 2011; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Roswell International Air Center Airport, NM (ROW/KROW); 03 April 2011; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Roswell International Air Center Airport, NM (ROW/KROW); 03 April 2011; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Roswell International Air Center Airport, NM (ROW/KROW); 03 April 2011; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Roswell International Air Center Airport, NM (ROW/KROW); 03 April 2011; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Roswell International Air Center Airport, NM (ROW/KROW); 03 April 2011; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane carried 29 passengers and four crew members. One passenger survived the accident. The airplane operated on behalf of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) on flight UNO834, a round trip from Kinshasa-N'Djili Airport (FIH) to Kisangani (FKI).  The aircraft took off from Kisangani for Kinshasa at 12:18. The pilot in command was the pilot flying on this leg. At 13:31, the crew reported to Kinshasa Approach that they were over position GURUT (137 NM from Kinshasa), gave their Expected Time of Arrival Kinshasa as 13:55 and received the latest Kinshasa weather information. At the time, Kinshasa weather being reported was wind 340 degrees, 8 knots, visibility 10 km, scattered clouds at 2500 feet, Charlie Bravos (CBs) at 3000 feet, CBs in the North East and South East, Temperature 33, dew point 23, QNH 1009, trend NOSIG. At 13:39, UNO 834 requested for descent and was cleared to descend to flight level 100. Meanwhile, on the on-board weather radar, the crew were able to notice presence of severe weather around and over Kinshasa airfield. At 13:49, when the aircraft was about 32 NMs from Kinshasa VOR/DME, the crew again sought latest weather information from Kinshasa ATC. They were informed that Kinshasa was reporting ""wind 210 degrees, 8 knots, visibility 8 KM, thunderstorm over the station, scattered cloud at 2500 feet, few Charlie Bravo 3000 feet, Charlie Bravo located north-east, south west and west, broken 12000 feet, temperature 33, dew point 23, QNH 1008, trend NOSIG"". The co-pilot replied to ATC that weather was copied and read back the QNH. At 13:50, UNO 854 was cleared for a straight-in Localizer approach for runway 24. The crew discussed options of avoiding the severe weather being displayed on their on-board weather radar by skirting around the radar returns. The aircraft approached the airfield at high speed. The indicated air speed came below 250 knots at 13:53 when the aircraft was descending through an altitude of 4630 feet and was 13 NM from threshold runway 24. While intercepting the Localizer for runway 24, the aircraft remained to the south (left) of the Localizer path. During the execution of the Localizer Approach, the crew made a more than 15 degree heading change to fly even further away from the Localizer path when the aircraft was between 10-7 NM from runway 24. As the aircraft came close to the airfield, the co-pilot sighted the runway on his right one o'clock position, when the aircraft was about 9.7 nautical miles from displaced threshold of runway 24. The PIC too, sighted the runway when the aircraft was about 6.4 NM away from threshold. At that stage, the aircraft speed was 210 knots, altitude was 3250 feet (or about 2252 feet above ground level) and the aircraft was in clean configuration. The crew decided to continue their Approach. The captain disengaged the autopilot, turned towards the runway and gave instructions to co-pilot to configure the aircraft for landing. The crew managed to regain Localizer path and align the aircraft to the runway by the time they were 2 NM from the threshold. At around this time, Kinshasa airfield was affected by a squall line. As the aircraft came on short finals, it encountered rain. By this stage, the aircraft was below the Minimum Descent Altitude (MDA) for Localizer Approach for runway 24. MDA for Localizer Approach for Runway 24 is 1470 feet or 472 feet Above Ground Level (AGL). The crew switched on wind shield wipers. As they descended further to about 224 feet AGL and runway was not in sight, the crew decided to carry out a go around. During the process of go around, a positive rate of climb was established with appropriate airspeed. While climbing through an altitude of 1395 feet (or 397 feet AGL); the aircraft encountered a severe weather phenomenon (probably a microburst). The wind shear warning came on. The aircraft pitched significantly nose down (from about 4-5 degrees nose up attitude to 7 degrees nose down attitude) in a very short period of time. The aircraft rapidly lost height. Before the crew could react to the pitch down and recover from the steep descent, the aircraft impacted the terrain. The airplane broke up and the main wreckage came to rest upside down. Probable cause of the Accident: The most probable cause of the accident was the aircraft's encounter with a severe Microburst like weather phenomenon at a very low altitude during the process of Go Around. The severe vertical gust/downdraft caused a significant and sudden pitch change to the aircraft which resulted in a considerable loss of height. Being at very low altitude, recovery from such a disturbance was not possible. The possibility of a somatogravic illusion caused Loss Of Control (LOC) as the primary cause of the accident, was also discussed by the investigation team. This was ruled out based on available evidence which showed that during the Go Around, the crew had initiated the climb at 1256 32 and had thereafter, maintained a climbing attitude for the next 12 seconds. At 1256 44, the aircraft experienced a sudden and steep nose down attitude change without a corresponding control input by the crew (as shown by FDR), Hence, Somatogravic Illusion caused Loss of Control was ruled out as a cause of accident. Probable contributing factors: 1. The inappropriate decision of the crew to continue the approach, in face of extremely inclement weather being displayed on their weather radar, was probably the principle contributing factor responsible for the accident. 2. Lack of adequate supervision by the Operator to ensure that its crew complied with established procedures including weather avoidance procedures and Stabilized Approach criteria, was a probable contributing factor. 3. Inadequacy of Georgian Airways Training program for upgrade to Captain was a probable contributing Factor. 4. Lack of effective oversight of Georgian Airways by Georgian CAA was a probable contributing factor. 5. Lack of appropriate equipment at Kinshasa airport for identification and tracking of adverse weather phenomenon, resulting in failure by ATC to provide appropriate early warning to the aircraft, was probably a contributing factor. 6. ATC not declaring the airfield closed when visibility dropped below Minima was a probable contributory factor.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: IAAI DRC Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: AFP  Radio Okapi  MONUSCO statement  SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) Clive Hindmarch; Kinshasa-N'Djili Airport (FIH/FZAA); 11 July 2008 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

He cycled the gear and then attempted a manual extension, both without success. The pilot then completed the landing on the nose and right main landing gear. A postaccident examination of the left main landing gear actuator revealed that the supports for the actuator bearings lacked lubrication and that the bearings displayed wear due to inadequate lubrication. The overhauled actuator had accumulated 377.5 hours and 285 cycles since overhaul and was installed about 31 months before the accident; the manufacturer's maintenance manual prescribed lubrication of the retract actuator and actuator support bearings every 1,000 cycles or 30 months (whichever occurs first). It could not be determined if inadequate lubrication was applied at installation or if a loss of lubrication was not detected in subsequent inspections. The manufacturer's maintenance manual cautioned: ""When washing the airplane with soap and water, use special care to avoid washing grease away from lubricated area. After washing the wheel well areas with solvent, lubricate all lubrication points. Premature wear of the lubricated surfaces may result if these precautions are not observed.""

The air traffic controller asked AC881 to maintain the position due to two pushbacks in the area. After the departure of a first aircraft, the controller authorized the crew of Oman Air flight 134 to do a long push back from stand A8 to position themselves facing west in order to then push back AC881 in front of them. After push back AC881 was not fully aligned with taxiway P. The pushback tractor driver pulled the aircraft in reverse to put it back in line with the track; first to the right of the aircraft, then to the left. The aircraft speed increased for about 15 seconds to reach 4 kt. During this manoeuvre, the B777 approaches the tractor. The tractor driver brakes. The angle between the tow bar and the aircraft axis increases. The train front begins to turn to the left, then the safety pins on the head of the coupling break. The aircraft continued to advance, the rudder pivoted and jammed under the left front wheel tyre and comes into contact with the tractor. It breaks down and the plane disengages from the tractor. The aircraft then continued to advance on the tractor. At 0944:45, the part of the bar still connected to the nose gear contacted the tractor and causes an additional rotation of the front axle. The tyre The right side splits on the left side of the tractor. The aircraft came to rest against the latter. The crew applies the park brake, as requested by wire link. Conclusion: The accident resulted from the decision to perform a PULL pushback manoeuvre, after an incomplete PUSH pushback, while an engine was running. The organisation of the sharing of procedures between the operator and all assistance personnel at the time of the accident contributed to the accident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Report number: c-vm110410 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

They requested a deviation around the weather, but the air traffic controller requested that they stand by. After entering the weather, they received clearance to turn; however, about 24,000 feet, the airplane encountered about 11 seconds of moderate, and then severe, turbulence. During the encounter, two flight attendants received broken ankles while conducting work in the aft cabin area. The digital flight data recorder revealed that during the encounter vertical acceleration forces went from 2.2G to 0.6913G within 1 second, to a minimum of 0.496G about 5 seconds after the 2.2G maximum.  A weather study conducted by a National Transportation Safety Board meteorologist revealed a frontal wave over the Japanese coast with a warm front extending eastward in the vicinity of the turbulence encounter. A gale force wind was expected. The region of the turbulence encounter also contained low to mid-level clouds with cloud tops near 14,000 feet; cumulonimbus cloud development, with tops up to 26,000 feet, was slightly upstream from the turbulence encounter. Review of the weather package given to the flight crew found no forecasts for turbulence and no Significant Meteorological Information advisories (SIGMETS) were in effect for the route of flight. At the time of the occurrence, there were no reports of turbulence from pilots ahead of the accident flight and the flight crew saw no indication of turbulence on their weather radar.

There were no injuries among the 202 passengers and 13 crew members. Flight 470 took off from Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG) at 08:55 UTC on a regular service to Caracas, Venezuela. The en route part of the flight was uneventful. Weather at the destination was poor due to the presence of several thunderstorms and rain. The captain was pilot flying during the ILS approach to runway 10 at Caracas. The airplane was aligned with the localizer at 10 NM from the threshold and the glideslope was intercepted at 6 NM. The crew selected a Vapp approach speed of 136 kts and moments later disconnected the autopilot and autothrottle. Passing 1000 feet above aerodrome level the crew was able to observe the runway. Descent rate at the time was -950 feet per minute and the airplane had rolled 3Â° to the right at an airspeed of 153 kt (Vapp + 17 kt). Shortly before passing 500 feet the captain had to correct some deviations, causing roll angles reaching 9Â°. At 200 feet the airplane was above the glide path and the pilot monitoring reported that the airspeed increased from 138 kt to 153 kt. The airspeed decreased again to below 136 kts with the GPWS warning ""Sink Rate!"" at 35 feet. The airplane touched down at 2,74 G with a descent rate of -1200 ft/min. Flight 470 taxied to the terminal without any problems. The captain reported the hard landing in the Aircraft Technical Log and reported it to the station manager at Caracas. One Air France technician performed a walk around check in very heavy rain and low light conditions. The Aircraft Condition Monitoring System (ACMS) did not generate an automated 'hard landing' report, and no report was received at the company's Maintenance Control Center (MCC). The Data Management Unit (DMU), part of the ACMS was checked and it was concluded that there was no defect. Consequently, the airplane was released for the return flight to Paris. Upon takeoff from Caracas at 18:30 local time, the crew were not able to raise the undercarriage. Several alarms related to cabin conditioning were triggered and displayed on the ECAM. After burning off fuel the crew landed safely back at Caracas. After parking, significant damage was found on the right hand main landing gear and fuselage structure. Causes: The hard landing is due to the continuation of the landing while the flight path changes should have lead to a go-around. The workload generated by flying without the assistance of A/THR, in degraded weather conditions is a contributing factor. The hard landing caused the implosion of the fixed piston of the damper of the right hand landing gear, which was not detectable on the ground at the stopover. This made it impossible to retract the landing gear during the return flight. The use of inadequate technical notes, the operator into force the day of the event and the lack of issuance of report R15 did not detect the damage caused by the hard landing. This has led to the departure of a commercial flight with a badly damaged aircraft.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Report number: f-cb110413 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  20 July 2023 F-GZCB Air France 0 Lome Airport (LFW/DXXX) min Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Osborne Airport (MNI/TRPG)"," AAIB","Accident investigation report completed and information captured","Following an uneventful flight from Antigua-V.C. Bird International Airport (ANU), the aircraft made an approach to runway 10 at John A. Osborne Airport, Montserrat. After a normal touchdown the pilot applied the brakes and noticed that there was no resistance from the right brake pedal. While maintaining directional control with the rudder pedals the pilot tried to ""pump"" the brake pedals but this had no effect on the right brakes. To avoid departing the end of the runway the pilot applied left brake and allowed the aircraft to veer left onto the grass just beyond the taxiway exit. The aircraft struck an embankment located 20 m north of the runway edge, about 150 m from the end of the runway. The impact, which was estimated by the pilot to be at about 10 kt, resulted in damage to the nose structure and caused the nose landing gear leg to collapse. The left wing tip leading edge was also damaged when it struck the embankment. After the aircraft came to rest the passengers were able to exit the aircraft via the main door The probable cause for the loss of right braking was trapped air in the right brake hydraulic lines. This air may have been present prior to the O-ring seal removal but was more likely to have been introduced during the seal removal and replacement. The engineer had carried out a brake bleeding procedure but he had not completed the full procedure as described in the AMM. He had not opened the bleed screw at the top of the right landing gear leg, and therefore air may have remained trapped in these lines. The investigation revealed the existence of several different brake bleeding procedures. The aircraft manufacturer had three different brake bleeding procedures, namely the Islander AMM procedure, the Trislander AMM procedure and their own production procedure. Three engineers from three different maintenance organisations had suggested that sometimes the manufacturerÂs procedures were inadequate for completely bleeding all the air out and that a hand pump attached to the brake bleed screws was sometimes required.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: EW/C2011/04/05 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  23 September 2019 VP-MNI FlyMontserrat 0 Montserrat-John A.

The flight from Shanghai, China, was uneventful and a normal final approach was established to Copenhagen Airport's runway 22L at 1000 feet AGL with the autopilot off and the auto throttle engaged. The airspeed was 152 knots and the vertical speed was 830 feet/min.  During the flare the pilot flying started to correct the rate of decent by increasing the pitch attitude. At touchdown the pitch attitude was 4.6Â°, the computed airspeed was 143 knots, the vertical speed was 160 feet/min.  The aircraft touched down and bounced three times. After the first bounce, the ground spoilers automatically retracted and the auto braking system disarmed. A second bounce occurred followed by a third bounce. After the third bounce, the speed brakes handle was pulled either by the pilot flying or by thrust reverser command, which deployed the ground spoilers and the thrust reversers.  The reversers were deployed in 11 seconds. During the deceleration, the pitch angle gradually increased to 10.5Â° and the aircraft suffered a tailstrike. At the same time the pilot flying felt an increasing pitch up attitude and decided to initiate a go-around.  An initiation of a GA after thrust reverser activation is very risky and not an option according to the Boeing 777 Flight Crew Operating Manual (FCOM) and the Boeing 777 Flight Crew Training Manual (FCTM). After the ground spoilers were retracted and the reversers were stowed, the pitch angle was decreased to 7.0Â°. At that time, the indicated airspeed was 117 knots. Engine power was applied and as the airspeed increased. The increase of the forward engine thrust caused a further nose up pitch moment, resulting in an increasing pitch angle of 11.9Â°. During lift off the indicated airspeed (IAS) was 140 knots, which was 8 knots below the V2 calculated speed. The lower speed gave less lift and kept the main landing gear compressed. The result was less aft tail belly clearance, leading the second tail strike. During initial climb, the flight crew noticed a beeper aural warning and the tailstrike caution on the upper Engine Indication and Crew Alerting System (EICAS) display. The flight crew performed a tail strike Malfunction Check List and a Go Around Check List. The pilot not flying informed ATC about the go around and the tailstrike indication and that the pilots didn't have control problems with the aircraft. A new approach was requested to runway 22L.The aircraft landed without further problems. CONCLUSIONS: After the third bounce and at touch down, the PF didnÂt prevent the pitch angle to increase. The lack of forward elevator control input caused the first tail strike.  During the GA, the aircraft was rotated to a pitch angle of 10.2Â° which caused the second tail strike.  The tail strike was prolonged as the pitch angle increased to 11.9Â° with a V2 speed minus 8 knots, which prolonged the time with a compressed main landing gear and less aft tail clearance.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: HCLJ Report number: HCLJ510-000835 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) Miklos SZABO; Milano-Malpensa Airport (MXP/LIMC); 10 September 2011 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft was operating a non scheduled flight from Imphal to Lengpui with ten persons on board including the pilot. The aircraft took off normally from Imphal at 10:00 hrs and subsequently came in contact with ATC Lengpui at 10:23hrs. ATC Lengpui conveyed the latest available weather with visibility as 4500 m. The pilot requested special VFR which was approved by the tower controller.  Visibility further dropped to 2000 m and the pilot preferred to enter a holding pattern, in coordination with ATC at 10 miles maintaining visual separation with terrain at an altitude of 6500 feet. The pilot thereafter without any communication with ATC reported downwind for runway 17 and subsequently reported for final. When the aircraft reported final, the controller after sighting the aircraft gave the landing clearance with wind as calm and runway surface wet.  The aircraft touched down well past the threshold at a high speed with a remaining distance in which it was impossible to stop the aircraft. It climbed a 10 feet high platform constructed to install the Localizer antenna at the end of runway 17.

The airplane carried 19 passengers and six crew members. All on board were killed in the accident. The airplane operated on Merpati flight MZ8968 from Sorong (SOQ) to Kaimana (KNG), Nabire (NBX), and Biak (BIK). The flight took off from Sorong at 12:50 for the one hour and four minutes flight to Kaimana. Cruising altitude was 15.500 feet and weather forecast for Kaimana indicated rain with a visibility of 8 km, half of the sky covered with clouds with cloud base at 1400 ft, winds from the southeast at 6 mph (5.2 kts) and temperature of 29Â°C.  At 13:25 the crew received updated weather information, indicating that visibility had decreased to 3-8 km, with cumulonimbus clouds at 1500 ft. At about 13:37, MZ 8968 reported at 7 nautical miles from the airport, descending through an altitude of 8000 ft.  Five minutes later the Kaimana AFIS (Aerodrome Flight Information Service) officer informed the crew that it was still raining at the airport and the ground visibility was 2 kilometers. During the approach to Kaimana, the flight crew flew to the south of the airport in an attempt to make a visual approach. The auto-pilot was disengaged at 960 feet pressure altitude. At 376 feet pressure altitude, the crew decided to discontinue the approach and climbed, turning to the left. Engine power was increased and flaps were retracted from 15 to 5 and subsequently to 0 degrees. The landing gear was also retracted. The aircraft rolled to the left with a bank angle of 11Â° and continuously increased up to 38Â°. The rate of descend increased significantly up to about 3000 feet per minute and the airplane finally impacted into the shallow sea. Kaimana Airport has a single runway, 01/19 (asphalt, length 5249 feet / 1600 m) which runs parallel to the coast with the sea to the west and mountains to the east. The airplane crashed into the sea about 800 m southwest of the runway 01 threshold and 550 m from the beach. It broke up and sank to a depth of about 15 metres. The airplane had been manufacturer in 2008. It was stored at the factory in Xian until it was delivered to Merpati in December 2010. Factors contributed to the accident are as follows: 1. The flight was conducted in VFR in condition that was not suitable for visual approach when the visibility was 2 km. In such a situation a visual approach should not have been attempted. 2. There was no checklist reading and crew briefing. 3. The flight crew had lack of situation awareness when tried to find the runway, and discontinued the approach. 4. The missed approach was initiated at altitude 376 feet pressure altitude (250 feet radio altitude), the pilot open power to 70% and 82% torque followed by flap retracted to 5 and subsequently to 0. The rapid descent was mainly caused by continuously increase of roll angle up to 38 degree to the left and the retraction of flaps from 15 to 0 position. 5. Both crew had low experience/flying time on type. 6. Inadequacy/ineffectivity in the training program may lead to actions that deviated from the standard procedure and regression to the previous type.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSC Report number: KNKT.11.05.10.04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources: Ministry of Transportation Indonesia  SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) National.

The seatbelt sign was turned off at FL320.  The airplane leveled off at a final cruise altitude of 37,000' and the ride was smooth up until the turbulence encounter.  Both the captain's and first officer's weather radar was in use before and during the turbulence event, and there was no adverse weather along the route visible on radar.  The flight crew received no weather updates from Air Traffic Control, no pilot reports (PIREPS), and there was no traffic along the same route in front of this flight. Evaluation of the winds using FDR data revealed that the aircraft sustained strong and adverse wind fluctuations on all three axes during the turbulence encounter, which included an upwards vertical wind gradient was about 80 knots in a 10 second timeframe.  Recorded ground weather radar information revealed that the flight was probably passing over or through the extreme top of a rapidly developing area of convective weather at the time of the turbulence encounter. Although ground based radar reflectivity data indicated that the precipitation rate within this rapidly developing cell at the time was light to moderate, detection of the cell would likely have required active adjustment of the aircraft's weather radar system. However, the flight crew was not actively manipulating the aircraft radar at the time of the event given the lack of severe weather indications. Probable Cause: An inadvertent encounter with unforecast convective turbulence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA11FA053 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA11FA053  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

There were 126 passengers and eight crew members on board. The airplane operated on a flight KGL348 from Surgut Airport (SGC) to Moskva-Domodedovo Airport (DME). Three passengers died and about 32 were seriously injured. The airplane was destroyed by fire. Initial reports indicate that the airplane had been towed to the main taxiway for engine startup. A short circuit occurred while the AC generators were connected to the aircraft's electrical system after start-up of the engines. A fire erupted in the rear, spreading quickly through the main cabin. The crew shut down the engines and initiated an evacuation.  The Interstate Aviation Committee reported that engines no. 1, 2 and 3 and the APU were not the source of the fire. The fire started in the rear of the aircraft in the area of frames 62-65. The cause of the fire was an electrical arc produced by electrical currents exceeding ten to twenty times the nominal loads when two generators not synchronised with each other were brought online but got connected together instead of being connected to parallel busses. The unsynchronised operation of the generators can be attributed to: - Poor technical conditions of contacts TKS233DOD responsible for connecting the generators with the electrical busses, that were damaged by prolonged operation without maintenance. A contact normally open was welded and fractured insulation material moved between contacts that are normally closed. These abnormal contact positions led to the connection between #2 and #3 generators. - Differences in the schematic diagrams of generator 2 and generators 1 and 3.

No injuries occurred during the event. The flight landed uneventfully at Toronto-Lester Pearson International Airport, Canada, where damage to the tail skid was discovered. Further damage to the aft pressure bulkhead was later discovered, and this damage was determined to be substantial. According to the captain, normal procedures were followed during preflight and taxi, including verification of the takeoff bug speeds. During the takeoff roll, the automatic, aircraft-generated V1 callout occurred and he began to rotate the airplane. The first officer did not call for rotation at that time. The captain applied nose up pitch command until he realized the indicated airspeed was too low. He said he then eased the nose of the airplane back down to the runway and re-rotated at the normal rotation speed, achieving approximately 10 degrees nose up at about 155 to 160 knots. The FO said he noticed that the automatic voice callout occurred about 20 knots early and observed the captain rotate for takeoff, but he said nothing to the captain for fear of causing confusion. The rest of the climbout, cruise, descent, and landing at Toronto was uneventful. According to the first officer, during preflight preparations, due to a last minute runway change, the takeoff data V speeds did not automatically upload into the flight management computer (FMC), so he manually entered the speeds using information on the preflight paperwork. Flight planning data indicated that the airplane takeoff weight was 161,037 pounds with a center of gravity at 22.5% mean aerodynamic chord, which under the conditions at the time of the accident should have resulted in a flaps 1 takeoff with V1 (takeoff decision speed) of 153 knots, a Vr (rotation speed) also of 153 knots, and V2 (scheduled takeoff speed) of 158 knots. The recorded data indicates the manually entered V speeds in the FMC were V1 123 knots, Vr 153 knots and V2 158 knots. Probable cause: The early rotation of the airplane to an angle at which the fuselage contacted the runway.  Contributing to early rotation was the CaptainÂs reaction to the erroneous V1 automated callout, likely assuming that the airplane was at or close to the correct Vr at the same time.  The erroneous automated callout was likely due to a keystroke entry error by the FO when manually entering takeoff data for a newly assigned departure runway.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA11FA050 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Flight IR277 took off from Tehran-Mehrabad Airport at 18:33 local time (15:03 UTC) and continued its route via UL125 and G781 towards Urmia. At 15:37 UTC, after coordinating with Tehran Control Center for an approach to Urmia Airport, the aircraft began to descend and at 15:42 UTC contacted the Urmia Tower and was cleared for the TUBAR2A procedure and a VOR/DME/ILS approach to runway 21.  Weather at the airport was poor with a visibility of about 800 m in heavy snow. During the execution of the approach procedure to land at Urmia Airport, the aircraft's stick shaker (stall warning) was activated due to the low speed in relation to the flap settings. The problem was resolved after corrective action was taken. At 15:54:49 UTC, the Urmia Tower controller requested the position of flight IR277 three times. Then, the flight reported its position as being 5 miles away. The Urmia Tower controller then inquired if the aircraft was established on the ILS, to which the flight responded negatively. The Urmia Tower controller then asked the flight if it intended to continue its approach for landing. In response, flight IR277 reported that it had abandoned the approach and was performing a missed approach. The controller then requested that the flight rejoin the IAF (Initial Approach Fix) for runway 21, and flight IR277 confirmed this. After the missed approach at 16:00:41 UTC, despite being at an altitude of 8,768 feet, with a pitch-up angle of 8.1 degrees and a left bank angle of 26 degrees, the aircraft, with a speed of 170 knots (within the operational limit) and flaps set at 50 degrees, experienced a second stick shaker activation and a decrease in altitude, indicating the aircraft was approaching the stall speed threshold. This possibly occurred due to a aerodynamic change in the aircraft, potentially due to ice formation on parts of the aircraft, such as the tail section, which lacks an anti-ice system, which led to an increase in stall speed.  The engine pressure ratio (EPR) of all three engines increased from (1.30 - 1.25 - 1.36) to (1.46 - 1.48 - 1.53) and then decreased over four seconds to (1.05 - 1.07 - 1.06). This could have been caused by disturbed airflow entering the engines, combined with the increase in bank angle from 26 to 40 degrees to the left, likely due to the stall. To recover from the stall, at 16:00:50 UTC, the pilot instructed for maximum power to be applied to all three engines. Initially, engine 3 reached an EPR of 2.14 at 16:00:53 UTC. However, due to disturbed airflow entering the engine, the EPR dropped, leading to engine failure. Five seconds later, engine 1 also failed in a similar manner. At 16:00:53 UTC, the Urmia Tower controller asked for the position of flight IR277 again. The flight responded with ""Standby."" The tower controller then asked for the flight's intentions, and the response was that they were abandoning the approach. Due to intermittent radio communication, the tower controller requested a repetition of the last transmission. Flight IR277 then stated, ""We are going to Tehran."" At 16:01:07 UTC, the pilot ordered maximum engine power. Only engine 2 responded, reaching an EPR of 2.11. The flaps were then retracted, leading to a quicker loss of altitude. At 16:01:08 UTC, in a radial of 150 degrees from the VOR and at a distance of 30 kilometers from the airport, near the villages of Meshkabad Olya and Hasanlu, the aircraft impacted terrain and broke up. Main Cause of the Accident: The main cause of the accident was the unfavorable and abnormal conditions experienced by the aircraft, combined with inadequate handling by the cockpit crew in response to the emerging situation. Contributing Factors: - The outdated technology of the aircraft's systems. - The lack of a suitable simulator for adverse weather conditions. - Failure to properly follow operational procedures by the flight crew. - Inadequate cockpit management (CRM).

Reverse thrust was selected immediately after touchdown, but the aircraft subsequently bounced and the commander decided to go-around.  During the go-around the No 2 (right) engine thrust reverser failed to stow, and the engine thrust was maintained at idle by the FADEC system. The aircraftâs tail struck the ground during the rotation. The aircraft became airborne at low speed in a high drag configuration and its acceleration and climb performance did not increase appreciably until 47 seconds after lift off.  The No 2 engine was subsequently shut down and the aircraft diverted to Stansted Airport, where a single engine landing was carried out. The No 1 thrust reverser was selected during the landing at Stansted, but did not fully deploy. The investigation found that the most likely reason for the No 2 thrust reverser failure to stow was an intermittent loose connection in the auto-restow circuit. It was further determined that conflicting operational guidance exists with respect to selection of reverse thrust and go-around procedures.

There were no fatalities. The airplane operated on a flight from Hoedspruit Airport (HDS) to Johannesburg-O.R. Tambo International Airport (JNB). Whilst taxiing to the cleared holding point for takeoff from runway 18, the pilot switched off the landing lights to avoid blinding an approaching aircraft. As a result, he overshot the turning point at taxiway C in the darkness and found himself at the end of taxiway A with insufficient space to turn around. According to him, he decided to maneuvre the aircraft out of the ""dead end"" by turning into the last taxiway, which led to military hangars, and then reversing the aircraft to carry out a 180Â° turn. This was to be done without external guidance. Whilst reversing the aircraft, the pilot failed to stop it in time, the main wheels rolled off the edge of the taxiway and the aircraft slipped down a steep embankment, coming to rest with the nose-wheel still on the taxiway.

This resulted in an altitude deviation of minus 400 feet to plus 400 feet from the assigned altitude of 35 000 feet above sea level. Fourteen passengers and 2 flight attendants were injured. The seatbelt sign had been selected âonâ approximately 40 minutes prior to the pitch excursion. The flight continued to destination whereupon 7 passengers were sent to hospital and were later released. Findings as to Causes and Contributing Factors 1. The interrupted sleep obtained by the first officer prior to the flight increased the likelihood that rest would be needed during the overnight eastbound flight. 2. The first officer slept for approximately 75 minutes which likely placed the first officer into slow-wave sleep and induced longer and more severe sleep inertia. 3. The first officer was experiencing a circadian low due to the time of day and fatigue due to interrupted sleep which increased the propensity for sleep and subsequently worsened the sleep inertia. 4. By identifying the oncoming aircraft, the captain engaged the first officer (FO) before the effects of sleep inertia had worn off. 5. Under the effects of sleep inertia, the first officer perceived the oncoming aircraft to be on a collision course and pushed forward on the control column. 6. The frequency of training and depth of the training material on fatigue risk management to which the flight crew were exposed were such that the risks associated with fatigue were not adequately understood and procedures for conducting controlled rest were not followed by the flight crew. 7. Although the seatbelt sign was on and an announcement about potential turbulence was made, several passengers were injured during the event because they were not wearing their seatbelt.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A11F0012 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: http://web.archive.org/web/20110118070027/http://www.cbc.ca:80/canada/story/2011/01/14/air-canada-turbulence-switzerland.html?  https://www.blick.ch/news/schweiz/kinder-und-eine-schwangere-betroffen-flug-mit-14-verletzten-in-zuerich-gelandet-id67269.html  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates15-Jan-2011 02:28 peterj Added 15-Jan-2011 04:59 harro Updated [Aircraft type, Registration, Cn, Location, Country, Source, Damage, ]24-Dec-2023 19:02 harro Updated [Other fatalities, Location, Country, Narrative, Category, Accident report, ]24-Dec-2023 19:03 harro Updated [Other fatalities, Departure airport, Destination airport, Category, ]27-Apr-2024 13:28 ASN Updated Corrections or additions? ...

The pilot and five passengers were fatally injured. The flight originated at BrasÃ­lia-Presidente Juscelino Kubitschek International Airport, DF (BSB). During a VOR approach to runway 32 in heavy rain, the airplane impacted Santo AntÃ´nio Hill, 11 km short of the runway. Contributing Factors (translated from Portuguese) - Obesity - undetermined Factors such as obesity and sedentary lifestyle, associated with the high workload in the moments before the collision with the hill, may have contributed to the fact that the task requirement in the final approach exceeded safety margins, leading to a wrong decision of the pilot. - Attitude - unspecified In facing adverse weather conditions and knowing that previous landing aircraft had better visibility at altitude below 3,500 feet in the final approach of the VOR procedure, the pilot may have raised the level of confidence in the situation to the point of continuing descent without considering the risk involved. - Emotional state - undetermined The conditions that were present in the final phase of the flight may have raised the level of tension in the cabin to the point of compromising the management of the situation by the pilot, who left the task of communicating to the passenger. - Decision-making process When considering that the pilot decided to descend from the minimum altitude to achieve visual conditions, it can be assumed that his decision, probably influenced by the experiences of previous aircraft, was made without adequately assessing the risks involved and without considering the option of flying IFR, taking in view of local weather. In addition, the pilot's decision-making process may have been compromised by the lack of information about the Morro de Santo AntÃ´nio in the approach letter - publication of aid for the pilot in flight. - Adverse weather conditions - contributed The images provided by the primary radar of the AnÃ¡polis Control (APP-AN) indicated the existence of strong cloudiness associated with heavy formations in the final approach of the VOR procedure. These conditions influenced the occurrence, causing the collision of the aircraft against the Morro de Santo AntÃ´nio, independently of the hypotheses raised in the investigation. - Navigation deviation - contributed The final approach on course 320 Â° (instead of the expected 325 Â°) led the aircraft to line up with the hill where the collision occurred. - ATS Publication - undefined Morro de Santo AntÃ´nio, an obstacle to control the final approach in which the aircraft collision occurred, was not identified in the VOR approach letter for lane 32, as anticipated by CIRTRAF 100-30, a fact that may have contributed to a possible reduction of situational awareness.METAR: 19:42 UTC /  local time: SBGO 141942Z 23007KT 1000 SHRA SCT013 BKN020 BKN080 25/22 Q1012 =20:00 UTC /  local time: SBGO 142000Z 20005KT 1600 -SHRA SCT010 BKN020 FEW030TCU BKN080 23/22 Q1012 =20:10 UTC /  local time: SBGO 142010Z 35002KT 4000 -TSRA FEW010 SCT030 FEW040CB BKN100 23/22 Q1013=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CENIPA Report number: A-606/CENIPA/2014 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 years and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  O Hoje 16-1-2011   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

King Airport (STT), Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands. The flight was cleared for takeoff from runway 28 at Saint Thomas Airport at 07:47 hours local time. At 07:48:44, the local controller advised the flightcrew, ""Convair seven seven quebec observe a lot of smoke coming from your left engine are you in need of any assistance sir"", to which the captain (pilot not flying) stated, ""ah no we are fine..."" The captain attributed the smoke trailing from the left engine to the age of the airplane.  The crew then switched frequencies to San Juan Combined En Route Approach Control (San Juan CERAP). Upon receiving a message from the local controller at Saint Thomas, CERAP reported to the flight crew that flames were now observed on the left hand engine. After being notified of the fire, the co-pilot reported they checked the engine instruments and did not have any indication of a fire. About that time the owner of the company who was airborne in another airplane told them they needed to return. The captain ordered the co-pilot to go into the cabin to visually look at the left engine and after returning to the cockpit informed the captain there was a fire. The captain advised that he executed the procedures for fire checklist and secured the left engine but the fire continued. The flight returned for landing at Saint Thomas, and at 07:50:50, the pilot of a company airplane reported, ""...you definitely have a fire going."" The flight continued towards Saint Thomas and ATC communications were transferred to STT ATCT. At 07:53:21, the flight was cleared to land. The captain later reported that while returning to Saint Thomas, he noticed an issue with the left aileron which the co-pilot assisted with. The airplane was landed on runway centerline at 90 knots, but the flightcrew were unable to stop the airplane. The captain also reported that there was no steering, the brakes were not working properly. During the landing roll the airport fire rescue vehicles followed the airplane while attempting to extinguish the fire and avoiding debris that was separating from the airplane. The airplane departed the right side of the runway, crossed a taxiway and a perimeter road, then went through the airport perimeter fence and came to rest upright with the nose section over a public road outside of the airport property. After the airplane came to rest, the flightcrew exited the airplane from the overwing exits, and the fire rescue vehicles converged on the airplane and extinguished the fire. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The captainÂs decision to continue the flight with the left engine backfiring, resulting in an engine fire shortly after takeoff.

Prior to departure the crew did not remove accumulated snow on the upper surface of the wing. Relevant Events and Factors: a. Contaminated ice and snow on tail section most likely cause sluggish rotation during the takeoff; this will result in over rotation, over rotation result in wing stall. b. Contamination of snow and ice on the wing, fuselage and tail will compromise the normal takeoff characteristics. c. With snow and ice and combination of disruptive air flow, heavier actual weights and over rotation, the combinations most likely not activate any stall warning safety design. The aircraft could stall asymmetrical without warning during takeoff. d.

Descending through 34,668 feet, the tailwind suddenly decreased and the indicated speed of the airplane quickly increased. The captain activated the speed brakes and disengaged the autopilot. Subsequently, the airplane began to slow. As the captain was slowly retarding the speed brakes, the airplane started to climb and the captain slowly lowered the nose of the airplane. The digital flight data recorder revealed that over a 30-second period the airplane's vertical acceleration decreased to 0.75 g, then increased to 2.33 g, decreased to 0.05 g, then stabilized at 0.9 g (normal). During the event, one passenger broke her femur; two cabin attendants and four passengers received minor injuries. The airplane was not damaged.  Convective activity was located immediately west of where the event occurred, likely blocking the wind flow and causing a wave-like disturbance downstream of the storms, which would result in unanticipated convectively induced turbulence. Since the event occurred in clear air downstream of the cumulonimbus clouds, the airplane likely encountered an undulating turbulence under a strong temperature inversion and strong windshear. The turbulence was not predicted by weather forecasters. Probable Cause: An encounter with unanticipated convectively induced windshear and turbulence during descent.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: WPR11LA139 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB WPR11LA139 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  9 February 2018 JA603J ?

There were 10 passengers and two crew members on board. Both crew members and four passengers were killed.  The airplane operated on Manx2 flight NM7100 from Belfast City Airport (BHD) to Cork Airport (ORK). Following a fuel uplift a total fuel quantity of 3000 lb (1360 kg) was recorded, which was sufficient for the planned round trip to Cork and back to Belfast. The flight plan specified Waterford Airport (EIWF) as the alternate for the sector to Cork. The accident flight took off from Belfast at 08:10 hrs, and climbed to Flight Level (FL) 120. The co-pilot was Pilot Flying (PF) with the commander acting as Pilot Non Flying (PNF).  At 08:48 the flight contacted Cork Approach Control. The Cork ATIS information stated that runway 35 was the active runway with Low Visibility Procedures (LVP) in operation. Cork Approach also informed the flight crew that runway 35 was the active runway with CAT II available for runway 17. The RVRs on runway 17 were passed by Cork Approach as 300 m (touchdown), 350 m (midpoint) and 550 m (stop-end) (300/350/550). Flight 7100 was given the choice of runways, and while runway 35 was initially considered by the flight crew, a decision was made to opt for an approach to runway 17. This was acknowledged by Cork Approach who stated ""...thatÂs copied, just check IRVRs Runway 17 for CAT II, currently at 350, 350, and 450.""  The aircraft first established on the ILS approach to runway 17 at 08:58 and was handed over to Cork Tower. The RVRs passed by Cork Tower at 09:00 hrs were 300/400/375. The approach was continued beyond the 3.5 nautical miles (nm) DME point (outer marker equivalent). A missed approach was carried out at 09:03 hrs, the lowest height recorded on this approach was 101 ft radio altitude. A second ILS approach was then flown, to the reciprocal direction runway 35, with the aircraft being handed over to Cork Tower at 09.10 at 8 nm from touchdown. At 09:10:56 the flight crew reported established on the ILS runway 35. The RVRs passed by the Tower at this time were 350/350/350. Descent was continued beyond the 4.9 nm DME point (outer marker equivalent). A missed approach was carried out at 09:14, the lowest height recorded on this approach was 91 ft radio altitude. At 09:15 hrs the flight crew requested to enter a holding pattern for 15 to 20 minutes to see if the weather would improve. The flight took up the holding pattern at point ROVAL maintaining an altitude of 3,000 ft. The flight crew requested the weather for Waterford. This weather, which was below minima, was provided by Cork Approach. The flight crew nominated Shannon Airport as their second alternate and requested weather information. Shannon weather was passed by Cork Approach, it was below minima. Weather for Dublin Airport was then sought by the flight crew. This was acknowledged by Cork Approach who offered to provide the weather for Kerry Airport also. The weather at Kerry was passed with the visibility being reported as greater than 10 kilometres. Weather conditions at Dublin, which were marginal, were obtained and passed to the flight crew at 09:35 hrs. At approximately 09:32 hrs, with EC-ITP still in the ROVAL hold, the RVR values on runway 17 at Cork began to improve. Following a further improvement to 500/450/400 at 09:39 hrs, the flight crew elected to attempt another approach to runway 17.  At 09:45 the aircraft reported established on the ILS, and was configured with landing gear down and 1/2 flaps selected. At 09:45:26, when EC-ITP was at 11 nm DME on the ILS, the RVR (touchdown) improved to 550 m, which was passed to the flight crew by Cork Approach. At 09:45:38, the flight was handed over to the Cork Tower and the flight crew reported to the Tower at 09:46:00 passing 9 nm DME. The final RVRs passed to EC-ITP at 09.46:15 were 500/400/400 when the aircraft was 9.6 nm from the threshold of runway 17. At approximately 400 ft radio altitude, recorded data shows the aircraft deviated to the right of the runway centreline, paralleling the centreline track. The descent was continued below Decision Height (DH). Power was reduced momentarily before being re-applied. Just below 100 ft radio altitude, a go-around was called by the PNF and was acknowledged by the PF.  Recorded data shows that the aircraft rolled significantly to the left as the aircraft tracked towards the runway centreline. This was immediately followed by a rapid roll to the right which brought the right wingtip into contact with the runway surface. Runway surface contact was made with a roll angle of 97 degrees to the right. The initial impact mark was located 86 m from the runway threshold, and 2 m left of the centreline.  The aircraft continued to roll rapidly to the right and struck the runway in the fully inverted position 25 m beyond the initial impact point. The inverted aircraft departed the runway surface on a heading of approximately 195Â° M and came to a rest 189 m from the initial impact point. The propeller blades on both engines were severely damaged; three of the four propeller blades on the right-hand engine detached during the inverted impact. Fire occurred in both engines post impact.  The AOC of the operator contained approval for the aircraft to operate CAT I approaches only. In this case a decision height of 200 feet at an RVR (touchdown) minimum of 550 m for runway 17 and 750 m for runway 35. The Investigation determined that the probable cause was ÂLoss of control during an attempted go-around initiated below Decision Height (200 feet) in Instrument Meteorological ConditionsÂ. The Investigation identified the following factors as being significant: - The approach was continued in conditions of poor visibility below those required. - The descent was continued below the Decision Height without adequate visual reference being acquired. - Uncoordinated operation of the flight and engine controls when go-around was attempted - The engine power-levers were retarded below the normal in-flight operational range, an action prohibited in flight. - A power difference between the engines became significant when the engine power levers were retarded below the normal in-flight range. - Tiredness and fatigue on the part of the Flight Crew members. - Inadequate command training and checking. - Inappropriate pairing of Flight Crew members, and - Inadequate oversight of the remote Operation by the Operator and the State of the Operator.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIU Report number: 2014-001 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) statement  Six killed as passenger plane crashes in fog at Cork airport (Irish Times, 10-2-2011)  Irish Examiner  SKYbraryÂ  History of this aircraft N3003T Fairchild Aircraft (registered, Oct 1991) XA-SES AÃ©romexico (delivered, Sep 1992) XA-SES Aerolitoral (leased, Sep 1992) ZS-PDW Norse Air Charter (Sep. 2003) EC-ITP Top Fly (registered, 22 Jan 2004) EC-ITP Top Fly (incident at Palma de Mallorcawhen it ran off the runway, 21 May 2004 ) EC-ITP LÃ­neas AÃ©reas de AndalucÃ­a (op. by Euro Continental Air, May 2008) EC-ITP Manx2 (leased, May 2008) EC-ITP Ibertour Servicios AÃ©reos (leased, Nov. 2009) EC-ITP Manx2 (leased, 2011) Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  21 May 2004 EC-ITP Top Fly 0 Palma de Mallorca Airport (PMI/LEPA) min Location  Images: photo (c) anon.; Cork Airport (ORK/EICK); 10 February 2011 photo (c) anon.; Cork Airport (ORK/EICK); 10 February 2011 photo (c) anon.; Cork Airport (ORK/EICK); 10 February 2011 photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Lanzarote Airport (ACE/GCRR); January 2007 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates17-Aug-2024 19:25 ASN Updated The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane incurred substantial left wing damage when the left main landing gear collapsed during the overrun.  The purpose of the flight was a test flight following the installation of the airplane's interior prior to delivery of the airplane to its owner. The flight departed from Appleton about 10:10. The flight returned about three hours later. While the airplane was inside the final approach fix, an amber left side hydraulic quantity low crew alerting system (CAS) message illuminated. The pilot flying (PF) noticed the hydraulic fluid quantity decreasing. Subsequently, an amber left hydraulic system fail CAS message appeared. The pilot not flying (PNF) pulled out the checklist to accomplish the left hydraulic system failure procedures and then suggested a go-around because the landing runway was about 500 feet shorter than the recommended minimum runway length indicated in the checklist. The PF decided to land due to the hydraulic quantity indications, prior autopilot problems, and the airplane's landing configuration. The PNF turned on the auxiliary pump about 500 feet above ground level, and both the PF and PNF thought the auxiliary hydraulic system could support normal spoilers, brakes, and nosewheel steering. The PF selected right thrust reverser aft and began pressing the brakes, but he felt no braking action. He reached for the emergency brakes; however, he did not immediately apply them to slow the airplane because he decided that there was not enough distance remaining to stop the airplane on the runway. Therefore, he attempted to go around with insufficient runway remaining by advancing the throttles to the maximum continuous thrust setting. The PNF did not see the airspeed increase and believed that not enough runway remained to get airborne, so he pulled the throttles back to avoid a runway overrun. The airplane exited the runway and sustained substantial damage. A review of the cockpit voice recorder transcript indicated that, before the emergency, the flight crew did not maintain a disciplined cockpit environment that focused on operationally relevant discussion but instead repeatedly made reference to and discussed objects on the ground and other operationally irrelevant topics. The lack of a sterile cockpit did not promote crew coordination and communication and adherence to procedures, which would have helped mitigate this emergency. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The pilot flying's (PF) decision to land on a shorter-than-recommended runway with a known left hydraulic system failure rather than go around as suggested by the pilot-not-flying, his failure to immediately apply emergency brakes following the detection of the lack of normal brakes, and his attempt to go around late in the landing roll with insufficient runway remaining. Contributing to the accident was the nose landing gear swivel assembly failure, the lack of a hydraulic fuse before this critical failure point, and the design of the swivel using two similar alloys with a propensity to adhere to each other when rubbed together. Also contributing to the accident was the lack of a disciplined cockpit environment.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN11FA193 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) Holm; Stockholm-Arlanda Airport (ARN/ESSA); 13 June 2017 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All 12 passengers and two crew members on board were killed. The airplane operated on Central American Airways flight 731 from San Pedro Sula (SAP) to Tegucigalpa (TGU). The flight had departed San Pedro Sula at 07:04 for the forty minute flight to Tegucigalpa. The pilot flying deviated from the airways without clearance from air traffic control. At 07:34 the controller at Toncontin Airport cleared the flight direct to the 15 DME fix (final approach fix) for a VOR/DME approach to runway 20 and to descend to 9000 feet. At 07:51 the fight reported that they were performing a missed approach, after which the flight was cleared for a VOR/DME approach to runway 02. The airplane was lined up with runway 02 and descending with full flaps, when at about 12 km from the runway the airplane stalled. The descent could not be arrested and the airplane impacted a wooded hillside at an elevation of 5412 ft. PROBABLE CAUSES (translated from original Spanish language report):  1) Weather conditions existing at the time of the event, during the approach to the runway the aircraft was operated slightly above the stall speed and a major change in wind speed could cause a stall. The altitude at which the windshear occured, and the reaction time of the pilot and the responsiveness of the aircraft determined whether the descent could be arrested in time to avoid an accident.  2) No published descent procedures were performed, possibly misinterpretation of Flight Instruments (altimeter, airspeed indicator).  3) During the descent to the VOR/DME for runway 20 and 02, the pilot in command (PIC) did not check his approach chart, and did not continually consult the first officer on the altitude and course.  4) There was no adequate communication between crew; deficient CRM (No approach briefing was made for any of the two approaches).  5) The aircraft was configured for landing with flaps fully down (flap 42) at a very long distance from the track without having it in sight. It is noteworthy that the aircraft will not respond to an adverse condition windshear as it appeared at that time with such a configuration. It should be noted that in both approaches it is mandatory to perdorm a ""circuling"" procedure.METAR: 14:00 UTC / 08:00 local time: MHTG 141400Z 36009KT 5000 VCSH FEW007 BKN020 17/14 Q1022 A3018 NOSIG=Wind 360 degrees at 9 knots; Visibility 5000m; Showers in the vicinity; Few clouds 700 ft., broken clouds 2,000 ft.; Temperature 17Â°C; Dew point 14Â°C; 1022 hPaAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIAA Honduras Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: El Tiempo  La Tribuna  Confirmado: Catorce personas fallecieron en accidente de aviaciÃ³n en Las Mesitas (Proceso, 14-2-2011)   Location  Images: photo (c) Nelson Mejia; San Pedro Sula-Ramon Villeda Morales Airport (SAP/MHLM); 31 August 2010 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane operated on a flight from Grenchen Airport. Destination of the ferry flight was Newquay-Cornwall Airport (NQY) in England. The co-pilot was pilot flying (PF) and the commander was pilot not flying (PNF). HB-VOV left stand ""white alpha"" at 08:48 LT. The crew had previously received the necessary clearance to take off from runway 07 after a request to Grenchen aerodrome control (tower). The de-icing system was switched on from the outset in view of the prevailing conditions. The taxi checklist was completed on the short route to the runway 07 holding position via taxiway WHISKEY. This included, among other things, testing the functionality of the brakes, which was carried out by both crew members. No anomalies were found. At approximately the same time, the Grenchen aerodrome control air traffic control officer (ATCO) arranged for a runway inspection, as visibility did not allow a view from the tower to the end of runway 07.  After receiving clearance at 08:51 LT, the commander steered the aircraft onto runway 07 and initially turned west, in order to have the maximum runway length available for the subsequent takeoff (backtrack). After a further 180 degree clockwise turn, HB-VOV was positioned just north of the runway centerline, pointing to the east. To take advantage of the available runway length, the commander, according to his own statements, did not manoeuvre the aircraft precisely onto the runway centerline. Runway 07 has a takeoff run available (TORA) of 3281 ft (1000 m). The ATCO observed HB-VOV taxiing onto the runway and instructed the crew to hold on the runway, as a runway inspection was still in progress. In view of the expected delay, the commander then set the parking brake. At 08:53:43 LT, the crew of HB-VOV received takeoff clearance: ""Hotel Oscar Victor, wind zero six zero degrees six knots, runway zero seven, cleared for takeoff"". The commander then switched on the pitot heater and landing lights, pushed the thrust levers forward and handed control over to the copilot. He instructed the copilot, in view of the reduced visibility, to carry out a so-called standing takeoff. At a power setting with a low-pressure compressor speed N1 of approximately 90% of the rated speed the copilot took his feet off the brake pedals, set takeoff thrust and steered the aircraft on the runway centerline. The set takeoff thrust was checked by both crew members. The ATCO watched the HB-VOV takeoff roll and noticed slower acceleration than usual.  After checking the takeoff thrust and the speed indications at the beginning of the takeoff roll, the commander had the impression that the aircraft's acceleration was lower than usual. HB-VOV attained a speed of 80 kt before taxiway ECHO 1, i.e. rather late, but still within a framework which seemed acceptable to the commander. On reaching rotation speed (VR), in the co-pilot's estimation approximately 250 m before the end of the runway, the commander called out ""rotate"", whereupon the copilot pulled on the control column. Both crew members immediately noticed that the nose of the aircraft was not lifting. After a repeated callout by the commander, he too pulled on the control column. On overshooting the end of the runway, the right main landing gear of HB-VOV struck a ""end-of-runway"" light, which was perceived by the crew as a distinctly noticeable impact. On the transition from the runway to the grass, the copilot, according to his statement, had the feeling that it was no longer possible to continue the takeoff and briefly reduced power. But at approximately the same time, the copilot noted that HB-VOV had already lifted off and applied full power again. At the same time, he asked the commander whether the takeoff process should continue. The latter answered the copilot's question in the affirmative, with the consideration that they would perhaps still have a chance to get the aircraft into the air. The events from overshooting the end of the runway to lift-off of HB-VOV, after a roll of more than 100 metres in the adjacent meadow, occurred within a few seconds. In the process the aircraft crossed a small stream bed running perpendicular to the runway. Once the aircraft had attained the normal attitude for a climb at the appropriate takeoff safety speed V2, the commander reduced power to maximum continuous thrust (MCT) and retracted the flaps. Then the crew realised that the parking brake was still set. The commander retracted the landing gear and detected that the red warning light did not go out. He instructed the copilot to keep the speed low and extended the gear again. All three landing gear indicators indicated green. At an altitude of approximately 3500 ft AMSL, HB-VOV was transferred to Berne arrival air traffic control. As part of the climb check, the de-icing system was switched off again. The crew subsequently decided to make an alternate landing at Zurich airport. The crew did not declare an emergency and did not apply for landing priority. According to the landing gear indicators in the cockpit, the crew assumed that the landing gear was extended and locked. For this reason they did not make a low pass at Zurich airport for an external visual check of the landing gear. After the approach and landing, HB-VOV exited runway 14 at the end via taxiway HOTEL 3. The crew then waived a visual check and taxied the aircraft directly to the stand on the apron near the General Aviation Centre (GAC). As a result of the collision of the right main landing gear of HB-VOV with the endof-runway light and the subsequent crossing of the stream bed, structural damage was found in the area of the nose gear and main gear, as well as to both rear wing spars. Also, a certain asymmetry was ascertained in the dimensions of the aircraft. The two pilots were uninjured in the accident. CAUSES: The accident is attributable to a collision with obstacles beyond the end of the runway, because the aircraft did not achieve the expected acceleration during the take-off roll and because the take-off roll was nevertheless continued. The following causal factors were identified: - reduced acceleration of the aircraft during take-off because of the set parking brake. - the missing decision of the crew to respond to the reduced acceleration by aborting the take-off. The fact that the aircraft had no warning device to indicate a set parking brake when the take-off roll is initiated contributed to the accident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: SUST Report number: Nr. 2156 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

In examinations of the external surface of the pin, in a region close to the fatigue fracture, cracks were observed that had initiated from scratches created by an inadequate maintenance machining process. In the region where the overload-related fracture occurred, it was also possible to identify that the machining process had modified the profile of the part in the section transition region, by producing a depression. Thus, it can be said that the AFT PIVOT PIN (D61000 and SN 25) of the PR-TTI left main gear broke on account of fatigue, whose onset was facilitated by an inadequate machining process that had been performed in the section transition region of the pin. 3 Material Factor Not a contributor.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CENIPA Report number: A - 012/CENIPA/2013 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Pista de Aeroporto de Altamira segue parcialmente interditada (G1)  REGISTRO FOTOGRÃFICO DO ACIDENTE COM AVIÃO DA TRIP EM ALTAMIRA (SBHT)   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight crew, therefore, advised the passengers and the flight attendants that the descent would be bumpy and then advised the flight attendants that all descent and before-landing cabin securing activities should be completed about 10 minutes earlier than normal. Before the descent, the flight crew turned on the seatbelt sign and upon reaching 25,000 feet, the flying pilot began reducing the airspeed to that prescribed for turbulence penetration. As the airplane passed through 24,000 feet (4,000 feet higher than the altitude of the turbulence noted in the pilot report), three flight attendants were just finishing their activities, and the airplane suddenly encountered moderate turbulence for about 30 seconds.

None of the eleven occupants were injured. The airplane operated on scheduled flight M3990 from OLA (Ãrland) to OSL. During roll-out following a normal landing, when the aircraft's speed had decreased to less than 60 kt, the aircraft started an uncommanded turn to the right. The nose wheel steering system was activated. The course could not be corrected, and the aircraft veered off the side of the runway where it became stuck in hard-packed snow one meter deep. The investigation has shown that the loss of control was most likely caused by a fault in the nose wheel steering. The same problem had occurred six days earlier, but the commander then managed to disconnect the nose wheel steering in time and regained control. The fault could not be reproduced, and the aircraft was released to service after inspection and testing without remarks. The nose wheel steering system on this aircraft type is relatively complex, and over time several improvements have been made to improve its reliability. The Flight Manual has a caution related to activation of nose wheel steering at speeds higher than normal taxi speed. There was some freezing rain/freezing fog at the time of the accident. Comprehensive technical examination of the nose wheel steering on OY-NPB uncovered no single causal factor, but some indications of unsatisfactory maintenance. Irregularities that alone or in combination could have caused a temporary fault with the steering were present. The Accident Investigation Board believes that a temporary fault caused the nose wheel to unintentionally lock itself in a position towards the right. No other defects or irregularities that could explain why the aircraft veered off the runway were found.METAR: 02:41 UTC /  local time: 280241Z 19003KT 7000 FEW009 BKN025 M05/M06 Q1027Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIBN Report number: SL 2012/06 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: AIBN Norway   Location  Images: photo (c) AIBN; Oslo-Gardermoen Airport (OSL); 02 March 2011; (publicdomain) photo (c) Allan J.

The pilot applied maximum braking and reverse thrust, but could not stop the airplane before exiting the runway. The reported weather was visibility of 3/4 mile in mist and an indefinite ceiling at 200 feet. The operator reported that there was no mechanical malfunction or failure of the airplane that would have precluded normal operation. Both pilots were likely influenced by the mission pressure to land because of medical considerations for a passenger on board.

All 31 passengers and three crew members survived. The airplane operated on a flight from ReykjavÃ­k Domestic Airport (RKV), Iceland to GodthÃ¥b/Nuuk Airport (GOH), Greenland with an enroute stop at Kulusuk. At 12:58, the flight crew of TF-JMB made radio contact with Nuuk AFIS and were informed that the runway in use was 23. The weather was reported to be: wind direction from 170Â° at a speed of 24 kts with a maximum of 43 kts, the visibility was 4,000 meters in light snow, moderate blowing snow, a few clouds at 1,800 feet, broken clouds at 3,500 feet, the temperature was zero, the dew point was minus four Celsius and the QNH was 1014 hPa.  The flight crew made visual contact with the runway and decided to deviate to the right (west) of the offset Localizer (LLZ) to runway 23. The flight continued towards the runway from a position right of the runway centerline. The flight crew was aiming to land the aircraft at a point between the runway threshold and the touchdown zone.  As the aircraft approached runway 23 it was still in the final right turn over the landing threshold. The aircraft touched down on runway 23 between the runway threshold and the touchdown zone and to the left of the runway centerline. The Flight Data Recorder (FDR) data indicated that the aircraft was banking more than 11Â° to the right as the aircraft touched down. At the same time the vertical acceleration was approximately 3.9 G and the rate of descent was greater than 13 feet per second. The right main landing gear (MLG) shock strut fuse pin sheared and the right MLG collapsed, the aircraft skidded down the runway and departed the runway to the right. The nose landing gear was separated from the aircraft as the aircraft was entering the unpaved surface. The aircraft came to rest in the rocky area to the right of runway 23. Adverse wind and turbulence conditions at BGGH led to flight crew task saturation on final approach and a breakdown of optimum cockpit resource management (CRM) resulting in a divergence from the operatorÂs stabilized approach policy. The divergence from the operatorÂs stabilized approach policy caused an unstabilized approach and a hard landing leading to an excess load of the right MLG at touchdown.

The intended destination of the flight was Canouan (TVSC) in the Grenadine Islands but the pilot landed instead at Union Island (TVSU), some eight miles to the south of Canouan Island. In his report, the pilot stated that the ADF (Automatic Direction Finder) on board the aircraft was unserviceable and that they were navigating using the GPS and visual reference. On seeing Union Island, he assumed that it was Canouan and did not confirm this with the GPS distance. On seeing the high terrain to the west of the airport in Union Island the pilot decided to land from the east; hence his request to the Canouan ATC (STSC) to land on Runway 31. It was not until the aircraft was on short final approach that the pilots observed that the runway was 26 (the runway heading in Union Island (TVSU)) and not Runway 31 (the runway heading in Canouan TVSC)). The captain stated in his report that at this point, he did not believe that it was possible to execute a go-around due to the hills in his flight path. As a result of landing on the reduced runway length available at Union Island (TVSU), in addition to the tailwind component of approximately 10 kts, the aircraft was unable to stop and having veered off to the left, came to rest on the southern side of the end of Runway 26 striking the perimeter fence. CONCLUSIONS: Although the incorrect call sign (YV-192T instead of YV-196T) was consistently used by all of the Air Traffic Controllers, it does not appear to have contributed to the aircraft landing at the incorrect airport. The captain of the aircraft was not fluent in English and did not have an endorsement for English Language Proficiency on his licence. The Co-pilot had a level 4 endorsement. This lack of English Language Proficiency by the crew, particularly by the captain was, in the opinion of the investigators, a significant contributing factor in the aircraft landing at the wrong destination and therefore a major contributor to the accident. The Air Traffic Controller at Canouan (TVSC) issued landing clearance to the aircraft in spite of the fact that he did not observe the aircraft on when the pilot reported on final approach. The controller, in his report, stated that he found it strange that the pilot was requesting Runway 31 although the wind was favouring Runway 13. This coupled with the poor English Language Proficiency of the pilot should have caused him to be more vigilant prior to issuing landing clearance. The captain stated in his report that he did not observe the numbers on Runway 26 in Union Island until he was on short final. At that point, he decided that it was possible to execute a go- around due to the high terrain to the west of the runway and landed. The investigation revealed that the aircraftÂs performance was such that it could have executed a go-around up to the point of the threshold of Runway 26 in Union Island, by executing a turn to the south.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ECCAA Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: http://www.jeremietronet.com/unions-island-kiting-fishing-surfing-and-plane-crash/  https://whatsupcaribbean.wordpress.com/2011/03/06/plane-crash-in-union-islandupdated/  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The examination of the accident master brake cylinders and the cylinders from two other airplanes that had reportedly failed revealed several anomalies that could have caused or contributed to the airplane's failure to turn as expected. The examination revealed that the right pedal assembly may interfere with the adjacent floorboard when the brake pedal is compressed to or near the full-internal cylinder travel stop, which may cause an additional stop and limit the overall travel of the cylinder. The examination also revealed that numerous components or items may prevent the master brake cylinders from fully extending after the brakes are released and adequate travel (reduced pressure) when the brakes are subsequently actuated. Additionally, the examination revealed that the brake fluid may bypass the piston O-ring or Stat-O-Seal if parts are damaged or excessively worn. The cylinder manufacturer, in conjunction with the FAA, published Service Bulletin CAB-32-01, Revision 1, to address the noted mechanical anomalies. Probable Cause: The malfunction of a master brake cylinder, which resulted in a loss of braking action and subsequent loss of directional control and collision with three vehicles during taxi. Contributing to the accident was the inappropriate design and manufacture of the master brake cylinders.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: WPR11FA158 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  FAA register:  2.

The commercial pilot, the sole occupant of the airplane, was not injured.  The pilot reported that following two attempts to land in crosswind conditions, he was cleared to land and was instructed by the air traffic control tower controller to follow another airplane on final approach. For spacing considerations, the controller instructed the pilot to conduct ""S"" turns behind the traffic landing ahead of him. As the airplane descended to an altitude of about 200 feet above ground level, the controller instructed the pilot to go around and maintain altitude. The pilot executed a go-around procedure, which included retracting the landing gear and reducing the flap setting to one-half flaps. Shortly after, the pilot was issued a clearance to land. The pilot proceeded with the landing clearance and subsequently landed with the gear in the retracted position, which resulted in structural damage to the airframe. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed no mechanical anomalies or failures with the landing gear or landing gear warning system. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The pilot's failure to extend the landing gear, which resulted in a gear-up landing.

There were no injuries, and aircraft damage was limited to the nose and main landing gear, which was subsequently replaced. The flight departed Long Beach, CA (LGB) en route to Milan, Italy, with a planned fuel stop in Iqaluit (YFB), Canada. The flight time to Iqaluit was 5 hours and 36 minutes at a cruise altitude of 41 000 feet. The flight en route was uneventful; the outside temperature at the cruising altitude was approximately -60Â°C. The first officer was the pilot flying. An ILS/DME approach to runway 35 at Iqaluit was carried out with the autopilot on. The reported surface winds were within the aircraft limitations for a right crosswind with a light tailwind component. A reference speed (VREF) of 114 knots was calculated. The before-landing checklist items were completed 3 miles prior to the final approach fix. The autopilot was disconnected, and the aircraft crossed the threshold at a speed of about 118 knots. The aircraft touched down approximately 10 feet to the right of the centreline at 21:00. Once the nose wheel contacted the runway, the aircraft veered to the right. The crew applied full left rudder and left brake while selecting left nose steering with the tiller. Thrust reversers were also selected, but the aircraft continued to pull to the right. The aircraft departed the runway 4300 feet from the threshold and came to rest in packed snow 100 feet from the runway edge lights. The nose landing gear (NLG) came to rest in snow reaching the top of the wheel height, and the main landing gear (MLG) came to rest in snow reaching half the wheel height. Findings as to causes and contributing factors: 1. On touchdown, the nose wheel veered to the right, and the crewÂs attempt to control the uncommanded veer was not successful. 2. The electro hydraulic servo valve did not respond to steering commands, and the steering control unit logic commanded the steering selector valve to close. The steering selector valve did not close, and this condition prevented the nose-wheel steering system from free castering with the steering pointing to the right. 3. The electro hydraulic servo valve likely failed due to contamination, internal corrosion and exposure to cold temperatures. Findings as to risk: 1. If aircraft components have a lengthy time limit of operation without an accompanying periodic maintenance schedule, and component service history is not regularly reviewed, there is an increased risk of an unexpected component failure. 2. If cockpit voice recordings are not available to an investigation, this may preclude the identification and communication of safety deficiencies to advance transportation safety.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A11Q0052 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  16 October 2013 N818RC Tri Marine Logistics LLC 0 Biak-Frans Kaisiepo Airport (BIK/WABB) unk Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Causes: The accident is attributable to the fact that a landing was carried out even though at that time a vehicle was still on the runway. This meant that the aircraft, in the course of its landing roll, collided with this vehicle. The following factors contributed to the accident: - The excessively high approach speed on final approach led to an increased landing distance. - The pilot had had little actual training on the aircraft type involved in the accident and in operation on short runways.

The captain was the pilot flying and the takeoff, climb and cruise portion of the flight was uneventful. Prior to landing, the captain conducted the approach briefing, indicating that they would conduct a visual approach to runway 26, the gusty winds required a wind additive to the approach speed and would go-around if the approach was not stabilized. On final approach, the local controller cleared the flight to land and reported the winds were 310 degrees at 16 knots. The flight crew stated that at 1000 feet AGL the landing checklist was complete, the airplane was fully configured for landing and the approach speed was set to 132 knots (Vref + 5).  Recorder data indicated that during the final approach, the autothrottle was disconnected about 800 feet above the ground and the airspeed decreased to as low as 129 knots but did not go below Vref (127 knots). The first officer (FO) stated that he called out the low airspeed and adjusted the target airspeed from 132 to 134 knots. The captain increased power during the approach but the airspeed remained slightly below Vapp until landing. Pitch attitude on final approach was stable at about 5 to 6 degrees nose up. The pitch attitude at touchdown was about 7 degrees and the airplane touched down first on the right main landing gear (MLG) and then on the left MLG. The flight crew stated that they felt that the airplane bounced and both called for a go around simultaneously. About one second after the initial touchdown, the ground spoilers began to deploy, followed by an increase in pitch in the next two seconds from 4.2 degrees to 12.7 degrees. Thrust levers advanced to near maximum thrust about one second after the left MLG touched down and as the ground spoilers were in transit. Pitch attitude continued to increase to more than 14 degrees while the airplane was still on the ground. Neither flight crewmember was aware of a tail strike until the captain discovered damage to the airplane during the post flight inspection. The tail strike resulted in aft fuselage skin cracks and numerous sheared rivets, internal structural damage to the frames, a cracked support bracket, buckled floor beam, buckled main cargo deck floor panels, and buckled stringers.

The captain, first officer, and sole passenger were not injured.  The captain was the pilot-flying during the accident flight. After departure, the flight had to circumnavigate around numerous thunderstorms that affected the planned route of flight. When the flight was within 25 nautical miles (nm) of its intended destination, the flight crew cancelled the instrument flight plan and concluded the flight under visual flight rules.  The captain noted the wind was from 310 degrees at 19 knots, gusting 27 knots. A 5 nm straight-in final approach was flown to runway 36 (5,500 feet by 100 feet). The captain reported that the landing reference speed (Vref) was 110 knots, which included a 5 knot gust factor. As the airplane touched down on its main landing gear, it encountered a wind gust that raised the left wing. The captain corrected with a left roll input as he simultaneously reduced the airplane's pitch in an attempt to place the nose wheel onto the runway, but the airplane became airborne and drifted off the runway. The airplane touched down for the second time in the grassy area alongside the runway where the subsequent landing roll was completed without further incident. The captain reported that there were no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation of the airplane. A postaccident examination of the airframe revealed that the right main landing gear had shifted/twisted inside the wheel well damaging both forward and aft spar assemblies. Additionally, the aft movement of the nose landing gear had damaged the forward pressure bulkhead. Both engines appeared to have ingested foreign object debris past their first compressor stages.

One of the three crew members was killed. The airplane departed Saskatoon Airport, SK (YXE) at 15:03 for a geophysical survey flight to the east of Saskatoon.  At about 18:14 the aircraft experienced a shudder from the right engine just before it smoothly spooled down. The propeller rotation slowed and the aircraft yawed. The right engine torque fell below 20%. The crew confirmed that the right engine had lost power. Altitude at the time was 2300 feet and the 2 survey sensors were deployed behind and below the aircraft. The captain set maximum power on the left engine and the crew commenced to shut down the right hand engine. As the first officer had more experience on the aircraft than the captain, the pilots agreed to let the FO continue as pilot flying. The captain would continue with the checklists and radio communications. At 18:17 the captain notified the Saskatoon control tower of the situation with a MAYDAY call, advising they had lost power on one engine and were returning to Saskatoon.  By 18:18, the aircraft had climbed to 2600 feet asl and accelerated to about 99 KIAS, and the pilots had instructed the survey equipment operator to recover the survey sensors. The survey equipment operator got up to do so. The recovery process took 4 to 5 minutes. At 18:25, the flight reached 3100 feet asl (about 1400 agl), the maximum altitude following the right engine power loss. By 18:27, airspeed was about 105 to 110 KIAS, and both pilots had visual contact with the runway. The FO's plan was to fly a high steep approach, and he had not yet reduced the left engine power lever setting for the approach. The tower cleared the flight to land on runway 27. Meanwhile the fuel level left tank or fuel pressure left engine annunciators had illuminated, along with the master caution light. Neither pilot observed these annunciations. At about 18:28, airspeed was 105 KIAS or greater when the left engine smoothly lost power with no surging. The captain observed the torque indicator smoothly and rapidly decreasing from 100% to 20% within a couple of seconds. The airplane decelerated and yawed to the left. The altitude was 3000 feet asl (about 1300 feet agl).  Both pilots immediately concluded the flight would not reach the runway, and the captain pointed out a large street to the FO as a feasible forced landing site and the FO concurred. Neither pilot could see any better alternative. The left hand prop was then feathered. The FO maintained control of the aircraft throughout the descent. Airspeed slowed initially to 100 KIAS and later to 90 KIAS. The goal was to control the descent and impact, with a minimum airspeed of 90 KIAS to prevent a departure from controlled flight.  The pilots observed traffic on the road. They revised the intended touchdown site to the grass beside 51st Street, to the right of the traffic and light poles and the left of what they perceived as a frangible fence. Late in the descent the pilots identified that the fence was actually a noise abatement wall. The FO concluded that the flight could not be extended beyond the noise abatement wall and advised the other crew members. The aircraft landed astride the wall at 90 KIAS. When the aircraft came to a stop, the captain turned off the batteries and the master switch and pressed the cockpit engine fire extinguisher buttons. FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS 1. The right engine lost power when the intermediate spur gear on the torque sensor shaft failed. This resulted in loss of drive to the high-pressure engine-driven pump, fuel starvation, and immediate engine stoppage. 2. The ability of the left-hand No. 2 ejector pump to deliver fuel to the collector tank was compromised by foreign object debris (FOD) in the ejector pump nozzle. 3. When the fuel level in the left collector tank decreased, the left fuel level warning light likely illuminated but was not noticed by the crew. 4. The pilots did not execute the fuel level warning checklist because they did not perceive the illumination of the fuel level left tank warning light. Consequently, the fuel crossfeed valve remained closed and fuel from only the left wing was being supplied to the left engine. 5. The left engine flamed out as a result of depletion of the collector tank and fuel starvation, and the crew had to make a forced landing resulting in an impact with a concrete noise abatement wall.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A11C0047 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Plane crashes in Saskatoon, kills 1 (CBC)  Transport Canada - CADORS 2011C1061   Location  Images: photo (c) Rene Lavallee; Saskatoon Airport, SK; 02 April 2011 photo (c) Rene Lavallee; Saskatoon Airport, SK; 02 April 2011 photo (c) Rene Lavallee; Saskatoon Airport, SK; 02 April 2011 photo (c) Rene Lavallee; Saskatoon Airport, SK; 02 April 2011 photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Pickle Lake Airport, ON (YPL/CYPL); July 2001 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

They also noted, after landing, that there was a burning smell. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed fire damage to the aft equipment bay in the area of the right pylon directly above the auxiliary power unit (APU) exhaust duct.  There was evidence of chaffing on the right integrated drive generator (IDG) power feeder cable as well as damage to an adjacent hydraulic line.  Additionally, two support brackets, designed to secure the hydraulic line to the aft fuselage, near the area of the fire had fractured, with one bracket no longer attached to the fuselage. Consistent with the chafing, there was a pin-sized hole near the end of the hydraulic line where it connected to a fitting that was mounted on a bracket attaching the line to the airplane's structure. The pin-sized hole was near the chafed IDG cable strand, and about 0.0625 inches from the hydraulic line, instead of the required minimum distance of 2.0 inches specified in Bombardier wiring installation specifications. NTSB Metallurgical examinations of the IDG power feeder cable revealed that the damage to the insulation around the pin-sized hole was consistent with chafing.  The examination also found material splatter consistent with electrical arcing of the conductors. The damaged area of the hydraulic line revealed evidence of splattering and material expulsion consistent with electrical arcing against the hydraulic line's external surface. Additionally, the chaffed wire and hydraulic line were examined using energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) to determine if any material transfer consistent with an electrical arcing event, had occurred and the wire and the hydraulic line both had chemical elements not normally found in each. The bracket had fractured into two pieces, and one of the tabs matched the fracture on the main body of the bracket. There was fretting wear damage on the surface of the tab where it was attached to another surface indicative of the tab possibly having rubbed against a bolt or pin used to mount the bracket, and the fracture surface exhibited dimpled ductile fracture that is indicative of overstress bending. As a result of the findings from this accident, both Transport Canada and the FAA released Airworthiness Directives.

The two pilots and the two flight test engineers were fatally injured. The accident occurred during a planned one-engine-inoperative (OEI) takeoff when a stall on the right outboard wing produced a rolling moment that the flight crew was not able to control, which led to the right wingtip contacting the runway and the airplane departing the runway from the right side. After departing the runway, the airplane impacted a concrete structure and an airport weather station, resulting in extensive structural damage and a postcrash fire that completely consumed the fuselage and cabin interior. The National Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB) investigation of this accident found that the airplane stalled while lifting off the ground. As a result, the NTSB examined the role of ""ground effect"" on the airplane's performance. Ground effect refers to changes in the airflow over the airplane resulting from the proximity of the airplane to the ground. Ground effect results in increased lift and reduced drag at a given angle of attack (AOA) as well as a reduction in the stall AOA. In preparing for the G650 field performance flight tests, Gulfstream considered ground effect when predicting the airplane's takeoff performance capability but overestimated the in ground effect stall AOA. Consequently, the airplane's AOA threshold for stick shaker (stall warning) activation and the corresponding pitch limit indicator (on the primary flight display) were set too high, and the flight crew received no tactile or visual warning before the actual stall occurred. The accident flight was the third time that a right outboard wing stall occurred during G650 flight testing. Gulfstream did not determine (until after the accident) that the cause of two previous uncommanded roll events was a stall of the right outboard wing at a lower-than-expected AOA. (Similar to the accident circumstances, the two previous events occurred during liftoff; however, the right wingtip did not contact the runway during either of these events.) If Gulfstream had performed an in-depth aerodynamic analysis of these events shortly after they occurred, the company could have recognized before the accident that the actual in-ground-effect stall AOA was lower than predicted. During field performance testing before the accident, the G650 consistently exceeded target takeoff safety speeds (V2). V2 is the speed that an airplane attains at or before a height above the ground of 35 feet with one engine inoperative. Gulfstream needed to resolve these V2 exceedances because achieving the planned V2 speeds was necessary to maintain the airplane's 6,000-foot takeoff performance guarantee (at standard sea level conditions). If the G650 did not meet this takeoff performance guarantee, then the airplane could only operate on longer runways. However, a key assumption that Gulfstream used to develop takeoff speeds was flawed and resulted in V2 speeds that were too low and takeoff distances that were longer than anticipated. Rather than determining the root cause for the V2 exceedance problem, Gulfstream attempted to reduce the V2 speeds and the takeoff distances by modifying the piloting technique used to rotate the airplane for takeoff. Further, Gulfstream did not validate the speeds using a simulation or physics-based dynamic analysis before or during field performance testing. If the company had done so, then it could have recognized that the target V2 speeds could not be achieved even with the modified piloting technique. In addition, the difficulties in achieving the target V2 speeds were exacerbated in late March 2011 when the company reduced the target pitch angle for some takeoff tests without an accompanying increase in the takeoff speeds. Gulfstream maintained an aggressive schedule for the G650 flight test program so that the company could obtain Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) type certification by the third quarter of 2011. The schedule pressure, combined with inadequately developed organizational processes for technical oversight and safety management, led to a strong focus on keeping the program moving and a reluctance to challenge key assumptions and highlight anomalous airplane behavior during tests that could slow the pace of the program. These factors likely contributed to key errors, including the development of unachievable takeoff speeds, as well as the superficial review of the two previous uncommanded roll events, which allowed the company's overestimation of the in-ground-effect stall AOA to remain undetected. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the cause of this accident was an aerodynamic stall and subsequent uncommanded roll during a one engine-inoperative takeoff flight test, which were the result of (1) Gulfstream's failure to properly develop and validate takeoff speeds for the flight tests and recognize and correct the takeoff safety speed (V2) error during previous G650 flight tests, (2) the G650 flight test team's persistent and increasingly aggressive attempts to achieve V2 speeds that were erroneously low, and (3) Gulfstream's inadequate investigation of previous G650 uncommanded roll events, which indicated that the company's estimated stall angle of attack while the airplane was in ground effect was too high. Contributing to the accident was Gulfstream's failure to effectively manage the G650 flight test program by pursuing an aggressive program schedule without ensuring that the roles and responsibilities of team members had been appropriately defined and implemented, engineering processes had received sufficient technical planning and oversight, potential hazards had been fully identified, and appropriate risk controls had been implemented and were functioning as intended.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NTSB/AAR-12/02 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Channel Six News  Gulfstream statement  NTSB  SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Roswell International Air Center Airport, NM (ROW/KROW); 03 April 2011 photo (c) NTSB; Roswell International Air Center Airport, NM (ROW/KROW); 03 April 2011; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Roswell International Air Center Airport, NM (ROW/KROW); 03 April 2011; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Roswell International Air Center Airport, NM (ROW/KROW); 03 April 2011; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Roswell International Air Center Airport, NM (ROW/KROW); 03 April 2011; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Roswell International Air Center Airport, NM (ROW/KROW); 03 April 2011; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Roswell International Air Center Airport, NM (ROW/KROW); 03 April 2011; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane carried 29 passengers and four crew members. One passenger survived the accident. The airplane operated on behalf of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) on flight UNO834, a round trip from Kinshasa-N'Djili Airport (FIH) to Kisangani (FKI).  The aircraft took off from Kisangani for Kinshasa at 12:18. The pilot in command was the pilot flying on this leg. At 13:31, the crew reported to Kinshasa Approach that they were over position GURUT (137 NM from Kinshasa), gave their Expected Time of Arrival Kinshasa as 13:55 and received the latest Kinshasa weather information. At the time, Kinshasa weather being reported was wind 340 degrees, 8 knots, visibility 10 km, scattered clouds at 2500 feet, Charlie Bravos (CBs) at 3000 feet, CBs in the North East and South East, Temperature 33, dew point 23, QNH 1009, trend NOSIG. At 13:39, UNO 834 requested for descent and was cleared to descend to flight level 100. Meanwhile, on the on-board weather radar, the crew were able to notice presence of severe weather around and over Kinshasa airfield. At 13:49, when the aircraft was about 32 NMs from Kinshasa VOR/DME, the crew again sought latest weather information from Kinshasa ATC. They were informed that Kinshasa was reporting ""wind 210 degrees, 8 knots, visibility 8 KM, thunderstorm over the station, scattered cloud at 2500 feet, few Charlie Bravo 3000 feet, Charlie Bravo located north-east, south west and west, broken 12000 feet, temperature 33, dew point 23, QNH 1008, trend NOSIG"". The co-pilot replied to ATC that weather was copied and read back the QNH. At 13:50, UNO 854 was cleared for a straight-in Localizer approach for runway 24. The crew discussed options of avoiding the severe weather being displayed on their on-board weather radar by skirting around the radar returns. The aircraft approached the airfield at high speed. The indicated air speed came below 250 knots at 13:53 when the aircraft was descending through an altitude of 4630 feet and was 13 NM from threshold runway 24. While intercepting the Localizer for runway 24, the aircraft remained to the south (left) of the Localizer path. During the execution of the Localizer Approach, the crew made a more than 15 degree heading change to fly even further away from the Localizer path when the aircraft was between 10-7 NM from runway 24. As the aircraft came close to the airfield, the co-pilot sighted the runway on his right one o'clock position, when the aircraft was about 9.7 nautical miles from displaced threshold of runway 24. The PIC too, sighted the runway when the aircraft was about 6.4 NM away from threshold. At that stage, the aircraft speed was 210 knots, altitude was 3250 feet (or about 2252 feet above ground level) and the aircraft was in clean configuration. The crew decided to continue their Approach. The captain disengaged the autopilot, turned towards the runway and gave instructions to co-pilot to configure the aircraft for landing. The crew managed to regain Localizer path and align the aircraft to the runway by the time they were 2 NM from the threshold. At around this time, Kinshasa airfield was affected by a squall line. As the aircraft came on short finals, it encountered rain. By this stage, the aircraft was below the Minimum Descent Altitude (MDA) for Localizer Approach for runway 24. MDA for Localizer Approach for Runway 24 is 1470 feet or 472 feet Above Ground Level (AGL). The crew switched on wind shield wipers. As they descended further to about 224 feet AGL and runway was not in sight, the crew decided to carry out a go around. During the process of go around, a positive rate of climb was established with appropriate airspeed. While climbing through an altitude of 1395 feet (or 397 feet AGL); the aircraft encountered a severe weather phenomenon (probably a microburst). The wind shear warning came on. The aircraft pitched significantly nose down (from about 4-5 degrees nose up attitude to 7 degrees nose down attitude) in a very short period of time. The aircraft rapidly lost height. Before the crew could react to the pitch down and recover from the steep descent, the aircraft impacted the terrain. The airplane broke up and the main wreckage came to rest upside down. Probable cause of the Accident: The most probable cause of the accident was the aircraft's encounter with a severe Microburst like weather phenomenon at a very low altitude during the process of Go Around. The severe vertical gust/downdraft caused a significant and sudden pitch change to the aircraft which resulted in a considerable loss of height. Being at very low altitude, recovery from such a disturbance was not possible. The possibility of a somatogravic illusion caused Loss Of Control (LOC) as the primary cause of the accident, was also discussed by the investigation team. This was ruled out based on available evidence which showed that during the Go Around, the crew had initiated the climb at 1256 32 and had thereafter, maintained a climbing attitude for the next 12 seconds. At 1256 44, the aircraft experienced a sudden and steep nose down attitude change without a corresponding control input by the crew (as shown by FDR), Hence, Somatogravic Illusion caused Loss of Control was ruled out as a cause of accident. Probable contributing factors: 1. The inappropriate decision of the crew to continue the approach, in face of extremely inclement weather being displayed on their weather radar, was probably the principle contributing factor responsible for the accident. 2. Lack of adequate supervision by the Operator to ensure that its crew complied with established procedures including weather avoidance procedures and Stabilized Approach criteria, was a probable contributing factor. 3. Inadequacy of Georgian Airways Training program for upgrade to Captain was a probable contributing Factor. 4. Lack of effective oversight of Georgian Airways by Georgian CAA was a probable contributing factor. 5. Lack of appropriate equipment at Kinshasa airport for identification and tracking of adverse weather phenomenon, resulting in failure by ATC to provide appropriate early warning to the aircraft, was probably a contributing factor. 6. ATC not declaring the airfield closed when visibility dropped below Minima was a probable contributory factor.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: IAAI DRC Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: AFP  Radio Okapi  MONUSCO statement  SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) Clive Hindmarch; Kinshasa-N'Djili Airport (FIH/FZAA); 11 July 2008 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft then continued to advance on the tractor. At 0944:45, the part of the bar still connected to the nose gear contacted the tractor and causes an additional rotation of the front axle. The tyre The right side splits on the left side of the tractor. The aircraft came to rest against the latter. The crew applies the park brake, as requested by wire link. Conclusion: The accident resulted from the decision to perform a PULL pushback manoeuvre, after an incomplete PUSH pushback, while an engine was running. The organisation of the sharing of procedures between the operator and all assistance personnel at the time of the accident contributed to the accident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Report number: c-vm110410 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

They requested a deviation around the weather, but the air traffic controller requested that they stand by. After entering the weather, they received clearance to turn; however, about 24,000 feet, the airplane encountered about 11 seconds of moderate, and then severe, turbulence. During the encounter, two flight attendants received broken ankles while conducting work in the aft cabin area. The digital flight data recorder revealed that during the encounter vertical acceleration forces went from 2.2G to 0.6913G within 1 second, to a minimum of 0.496G about 5 seconds after the 2.2G maximum.  A weather study conducted by a National Transportation Safety Board meteorologist revealed a frontal wave over the Japanese coast with a warm front extending eastward in the vicinity of the turbulence encounter. A gale force wind was expected. The region of the turbulence encounter also contained low to mid-level clouds with cloud tops near 14,000 feet; cumulonimbus cloud development, with tops up to 26,000 feet, was slightly upstream from the turbulence encounter. Review of the weather package given to the flight crew found no forecasts for turbulence and no Significant Meteorological Information advisories (SIGMETS) were in effect for the route of flight. At the time of the occurrence, there were no reports of turbulence from pilots ahead of the accident flight and the flight crew saw no indication of turbulence on their weather radar. Probable Cause: An inadvertent encounter with convective-induced turbulence upon entering cumulonimbus clouds.Sources: NTSB History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  20 January 2011 N766AN American Airlines 0 80 nm SE of New York, NY (Atlantic Ocean) non Near miss with other aircraft Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates20-Apr-2011 12:05 espeluk Added 21-Apr-2011 02:22 harro Updated [Date, Time, Total occupants, Source, ]21-Dec-2016 19:25 ASN Update Bot Updated [Time, Damage, Category, Investigating agency, ]27-Nov-2017 16:51 ASN Update Bot Updated [Cn, Operator, Other fatalities, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

There were no injuries among the 202 passengers and 13 crew members. Flight 470 took off from Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG) at 08:55 UTC on a regular service to Caracas, Venezuela. The en route part of the flight was uneventful. Weather at the destination was poor due to the presence of several thunderstorms and rain. The captain was pilot flying during the ILS approach to runway 10 at Caracas. The airplane was aligned with the localizer at 10 NM from the threshold and the glideslope was intercepted at 6 NM. The crew selected a Vapp approach speed of 136 kts and moments later disconnected the autopilot and autothrottle. Passing 1000 feet above aerodrome level the crew was able to observe the runway. Descent rate at the time was -950 feet per minute and the airplane had rolled 3Â° to the right at an airspeed of 153 kt (Vapp + 17 kt). Shortly before passing 500 feet the captain had to correct some deviations, causing roll angles reaching 9Â°. At 200 feet the airplane was above the glide path and the pilot monitoring reported that the airspeed increased from 138 kt to 153 kt. The airspeed decreased again to below 136 kts with the GPWS warning ""Sink Rate!"" at 35 feet. The airplane touched down at 2,74 G with a descent rate of -1200 ft/min. Flight 470 taxied to the terminal without any problems. The captain reported the hard landing in the Aircraft Technical Log and reported it to the station manager at Caracas. One Air France technician performed a walk around check in very heavy rain and low light conditions. The Aircraft Condition Monitoring System (ACMS) did not generate an automated 'hard landing' report, and no report was received at the company's Maintenance Control Center (MCC). The Data Management Unit (DMU), part of the ACMS was checked and it was concluded that there was no defect. Consequently, the airplane was released for the return flight to Paris. Upon takeoff from Caracas at 18:30 local time, the crew were not able to raise the undercarriage. Several alarms related to cabin conditioning were triggered and displayed on the ECAM. After burning off fuel the crew landed safely back at Caracas. After parking, significant damage was found on the right hand main landing gear and fuselage structure. Causes: The hard landing is due to the continuation of the landing while the flight path changes should have lead to a go-around. The workload generated by flying without the assistance of A/THR, in degraded weather conditions is a contributing factor. The hard landing caused the implosion of the fixed piston of the damper of the right hand landing gear, which was not detectable on the ground at the stopover. This made it impossible to retract the landing gear during the return flight. The use of inadequate technical notes, the operator into force the day of the event and the lack of issuance of report R15 did not detect the damage caused by the hard landing. This has led to the departure of a commercial flight with a badly damaged aircraft.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Report number: f-cb110413 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  20 July 2023 F-GZCB Air France 0 Lome Airport (LFW/DXXX) min Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Osborne Airport (MNI/TRPG)"," AAIB","Accident investigation report completed and information captured","Following an uneventful flight from Antigua-V.C. Bird International Airport (ANU), the aircraft made an approach to runway 10 at John A. Osborne Airport, Montserrat. After a normal touchdown the pilot applied the brakes and noticed that there was no resistance from the right brake pedal. While maintaining directional control with the rudder pedals the pilot tried to ""pump"" the brake pedals but this had no effect on the right brakes. To avoid departing the end of the runway the pilot applied left brake and allowed the aircraft to veer left onto the grass just beyond the taxiway exit. The aircraft struck an embankment located 20 m north of the runway edge, about 150 m from the end of the runway. The impact, which was estimated by the pilot to be at about 10 kt, resulted in damage to the nose structure and caused the nose landing gear leg to collapse. The left wing tip leading edge was also damaged when it struck the embankment. After the aircraft came to rest the passengers were able to exit the aircraft via the main door The probable cause for the loss of right braking was trapped air in the right brake hydraulic lines. This air may have been present prior to the O-ring seal removal but was more likely to have been introduced during the seal removal and replacement. The engineer had carried out a brake bleeding procedure but he had not completed the full procedure as described in the AMM. He had not opened the bleed screw at the top of the right landing gear leg, and therefore air may have remained trapped in these lines. The investigation revealed the existence of several different brake bleeding procedures. The aircraft manufacturer had three different brake bleeding procedures, namely the Islander AMM procedure, the Trislander AMM procedure and their own production procedure. Three engineers from three different maintenance organisations had suggested that sometimes the manufacturerÂs procedures were inadequate for completely bleeding all the air out and that a hand pump attached to the brake bleed screws was sometimes required.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: EW/C2011/04/05 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  23 September 2019 VP-MNI FlyMontserrat 0 Montserrat-John A.

The flight from Shanghai, China, was uneventful and a normal final approach was established to Copenhagen Airport's runway 22L at 1000 feet AGL with the autopilot off and the auto throttle engaged. The airspeed was 152 knots and the vertical speed was 830 feet/min.  During the flare the pilot flying started to correct the rate of decent by increasing the pitch attitude. At touchdown the pitch attitude was 4.6Â°, the computed airspeed was 143 knots, the vertical speed was 160 feet/min.  The aircraft touched down and bounced three times. After the first bounce, the ground spoilers automatically retracted and the auto braking system disarmed. A second bounce occurred followed by a third bounce. After the third bounce, the speed brakes handle was pulled either by the pilot flying or by thrust reverser command, which deployed the ground spoilers and the thrust reversers.  The reversers were deployed in 11 seconds. During the deceleration, the pitch angle gradually increased to 10.5Â° and the aircraft suffered a tailstrike. At the same time the pilot flying felt an increasing pitch up attitude and decided to initiate a go-around.  An initiation of a GA after thrust reverser activation is very risky and not an option according to the Boeing 777 Flight Crew Operating Manual (FCOM) and the Boeing 777 Flight Crew Training Manual (FCTM). After the ground spoilers were retracted and the reversers were stowed, the pitch angle was decreased to 7.0Â°. At that time, the indicated airspeed was 117 knots. Engine power was applied and as the airspeed increased. The increase of the forward engine thrust caused a further nose up pitch moment, resulting in an increasing pitch angle of 11.9Â°. During lift off the indicated airspeed (IAS) was 140 knots, which was 8 knots below the V2 calculated speed. The lower speed gave less lift and kept the main landing gear compressed. The result was less aft tail belly clearance, leading the second tail strike. During initial climb, the flight crew noticed a beeper aural warning and the tailstrike caution on the upper Engine Indication and Crew Alerting System (EICAS) display. The flight crew performed a tail strike Malfunction Check List and a Go Around Check List. The pilot not flying informed ATC about the go around and the tailstrike indication and that the pilots didn't have control problems with the aircraft. A new approach was requested to runway 22L.The aircraft landed without further problems. CONCLUSIONS: After the third bounce and at touch down, the PF didnÂt prevent the pitch angle to increase. The lack of forward elevator control input caused the first tail strike.  During the GA, the aircraft was rotated to a pitch angle of 10.2Â° which caused the second tail strike.  The tail strike was prolonged as the pitch angle increased to 11.9Â° with a V2 speed minus 8 knots, which prolonged the time with a compressed main landing gear and less aft tail clearance.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: HCLJ Report number: HCLJ510-000835 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) Miklos SZABO; Milano-Malpensa Airport (MXP/LIMC); 10 September 2011 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane carried 19 passengers and six crew members. All on board were killed in the accident. The airplane operated on Merpati flight MZ8968 from Sorong (SOQ) to Kaimana (KNG), Nabire (NBX), and Biak (BIK). The flight took off from Sorong at 12:50 for the one hour and four minutes flight to Kaimana. Cruising altitude was 15.500 feet and weather forecast for Kaimana indicated rain with a visibility of 8 km, half of the sky covered with clouds with cloud base at 1400 ft, winds from the southeast at 6 mph (5.2 kts) and temperature of 29Â°C.  At 13:25 the crew received updated weather information, indicating that visibility had decreased to 3-8 km, with cumulonimbus clouds at 1500 ft. At about 13:37, MZ 8968 reported at 7 nautical miles from the airport, descending through an altitude of 8000 ft.  Five minutes later the Kaimana AFIS (Aerodrome Flight Information Service) officer informed the crew that it was still raining at the airport and the ground visibility was 2 kilometers. During the approach to Kaimana, the flight crew flew to the south of the airport in an attempt to make a visual approach. The auto-pilot was disengaged at 960 feet pressure altitude. At 376 feet pressure altitude, the crew decided to discontinue the approach and climbed, turning to the left. Engine power was increased and flaps were retracted from 15 to 5 and subsequently to 0 degrees. The landing gear was also retracted. The aircraft rolled to the left with a bank angle of 11Â° and continuously increased up to 38Â°. The rate of descend increased significantly up to about 3000 feet per minute and the airplane finally impacted into the shallow sea. Kaimana Airport has a single runway, 01/19 (asphalt, length 5249 feet / 1600 m) which runs parallel to the coast with the sea to the west and mountains to the east. The airplane crashed into the sea about 800 m southwest of the runway 01 threshold and 550 m from the beach. It broke up and sank to a depth of about 15 metres. The airplane had been manufacturer in 2008. It was stored at the factory in Xian until it was delivered to Merpati in December 2010. Factors contributed to the accident are as follows: 1. The flight was conducted in VFR in condition that was not suitable for visual approach when the visibility was 2 km. In such a situation a visual approach should not have been attempted. 2. There was no checklist reading and crew briefing. 3. The flight crew had lack of situation awareness when tried to find the runway, and discontinued the approach. 4. The missed approach was initiated at altitude 376 feet pressure altitude (250 feet radio altitude), the pilot open power to 70% and 82% torque followed by flap retracted to 5 and subsequently to 0. The rapid descent was mainly caused by continuously increase of roll angle up to 38 degree to the left and the retraction of flaps from 15 to 0 position. 5. Both crew had low experience/flying time on type. 6. Inadequacy/ineffectivity in the training program may lead to actions that deviated from the standard procedure and regression to the previous type.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSC Report number: KNKT.11.05.10.04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources: Ministry of Transportation Indonesia  SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) National.

The seatbelt sign was turned off at FL320.  The airplane leveled off at a final cruise altitude of 37,000' and the ride was smooth up until the turbulence encounter.  Both the captain's and first officer's weather radar was in use before and during the turbulence event, and there was no adverse weather along the route visible on radar.  The flight crew received no weather updates from Air Traffic Control, no pilot reports (PIREPS), and there was no traffic along the same route in front of this flight. Evaluation of the winds using FDR data revealed that the aircraft sustained strong and adverse wind fluctuations on all three axes during the turbulence encounter, which included an upwards vertical wind gradient was about 80 knots in a 10 second timeframe.  Recorded ground weather radar information revealed that the flight was probably passing over or through the extreme top of a rapidly developing area of convective weather at the time of the turbulence encounter. Although ground based radar reflectivity data indicated that the precipitation rate within this rapidly developing cell at the time was light to moderate, detection of the cell would likely have required active adjustment of the aircraft's weather radar system. However, the flight crew was not actively manipulating the aircraft radar at the time of the event given the lack of severe weather indications. Probable Cause: An inadvertent encounter with unforecast convective turbulence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA11FA053 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA11FA053  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...
