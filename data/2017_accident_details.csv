Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, which operated on an instrument rules flight plan. The flight originated from Tucson International Airport, Arizona at 15:32. The pilot reported that, during the approach to Scottsdale, the nose landing gear light was red, which indicated that it was not down and locked. In order to assess the situation, the pilot exited the traffic pattern, and referred to the emergency checklist. After using the hand pump to lower the landing gear manually, the red light still indicated that the gear was up. The pilot asked the tower for a landing gear check and the tower replied that it appeared it was down and straight. The pilot executed a normal landing, and as the airplane started to slow down, about 35-40 knots, the nose gear collapsed.

Three crew members and six passengers were on board the airplane. At 07:20 UTC the airplane reached cruise level FL340. After entering Indian airspace (Mumbai FIR) the aircraft was cleared to fly to reporting point KITAL via route L894. At approximately 08:18 UTC the co-pilot radioed reaching reporting point GOLEM. At 06:55 UTC an Airbus A380-861 (A6-EUL) had taken off at Dubai Airport, United Arab Emirates, for flight EK412 to Sydney, Australia. The aircraft flew at FL350 with a southern heading. At 08:38:07 UTC the A380 had passed the Challenger overhead with a vertical distance of 1,000 ft. At 08:38:54 UTC the Challenger, with engaged autopilot, began to slightly roll right. At the same time a counter-rotating aileron deflection was recorded and fluctuation of the vertical acceleration began.  In the subsequent approximately 10 seconds the airplane had a right bank angle of 4Â° to 6Â°. At 08:39:03 UTC the right bank angle began to increase. Within one second the bank angle increased to 42Â° to the right. At the same time the aileron deflection to the left increased to 20Â° and the vertical acceleration to 1.6 g. In the following second vertical acceleration changed to -3.2 g. At 08:39:04 UTC a lateral acceleration of 0.45 g to the right was recorded. The pitch angle changed from about 3Â° to about 1Â°, then within one second increased to 9Â° and decreased again in the following second to -20Â°. At the same time the FDR recorded a rudder deflection to the left reaching 11.2Â° after about two seconds whereas the bank angle changed from 42Â° right to 31Â° left. Between 08:39:05 UTC and 08:39:10 UTC Indicated Airspeed (in knots) changed from approximately 277 KIAS to 248 KIAS. The N1 of the left engine of 95% began to decrease. The lateral acceleration then reached 0.94 g left, the autopilot disengaged, and a master warning, lasting seven seconds, was recorded. Both pilots had actuated the aileron to the right in order to stop the rolling motion. But the airplane had continued to roll to the left thereby completing several rotations. Subsequently both Inertial Reference Systems (IRS), the Flight Management System (FMS), and the attitude indication failed. Between 08:39:09 UTC and 08:39:41 UTC the FDR recorded a loss of altitude of approximately 8,700 ft. Large control surface deflections and acceleration were recorded. The speed increased and at 08:39:31 UTC reached approximately 330 KIAS. At 08:39:30 UTC the spoilers extended and 13 seconds later were retracted again. The N1 of the left engine had decreased to approximately 40% when the Interstage Turbine Temperature (ITT) began to increase and nine seconds later had reached 850Â°. The left engine was shut off. At about 08:56 UTC the Pilot in Command (PIC) informed the air traffic controller in Mumbai of the occurrence, declared emergency, and reported their position, altitude and their intention to fly via KITAL to Oman. At about 09:15 UTC the crew restarted the left engine. Subsequently the airplane climbed to FL250. At about 09:56 UTC the autopilot was re-engaged. At 11:05 UTC the Challenger landed at Muscat Airport. The A380 continued the flight to Sydney and landed there at 19:58 UTC. The aircraft manufacturer determined that the Challenger's airframe structure could not be restored to an airworthy state as it exceeded the airframe certification design load limits during the upset encounter.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BFU Report number: BFU17-0024-2X Status: Preliminary reportDuration: 4 monthsDownload report:  Preliminary report Sources: Oman Observer  atheer.com  PPRuNe   Location  Images: photo (c) BFU/Google Earth; over Arabian Sea; 07 January 2017 photo (c) BFU; over Arabian Sea; 07 January 2017 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The crew had planned a shortest possible ground stop before flying to Torp Sandefjord Airport. The captain flew the aircraft (PF), while the First Officer monitored the flying (PM). During the ground stop at Gardermoen, only one engine was stopped while the First Officer completed an external inspection of the aircraft He did not observe any ice or anything out of the ordinary on the areas of the aircraft that could be inspected. There were icing conditions at Gardermoen and in the airspace above the airport. After flying from Switzerland for more than two hours in approximately minus 50Â°C, the aircraft's surfaces (fuselage and wings) were more than likely chilled. When the crew requested taxi clearance, they were assigned a different runway than expected. This entailed a longer taxi time and thus longer exposure to the prevailing weather conditions. The aircraft's ground stop lasted approximately 15 minutes at an air temperature of 0Â°C. The taxiways and runway were covered with 3-6 mm of slush and it was snowing when the aircraft took off. Initially, the take-off proceeded as normal. The landing gear was retracted and both pilots observed that the speed was rapidly approaching 200 kt, which is the maximum speed with flaps deployed. As the flaps were retracted, the crew experienced a violent nose-down movement and the pilots were ""hanging by their seat belts"", while the aircraft started sharply banking to the left. The aircraft at this moment experienced negative 2.62 G. The captain did not trust the instruments while the First Officer had better situational awareness. The First Officer quickly took control and started a pull-out from the dive. The aircraft descended below the cloud base, and even though it was dark, the pilots could glimpse the ground. Control was regained and the aircraft levelled off 170 ft above the ground. The aircraft was overstressed to 5.99 G during the pull-out. The crew called ""MAYDAY"" to the Air Traffic Control. Once control was regained, the ""MAYDAY"" was cancelled and the flight continued towards Torp where an approach and landing took place without further problems. The aircraft was overstressed well above Ultimate Load Factor (-2.16 to +5.40 G) and considered not to be economically viable to repair. Primary conclusion: 1. The probable explanation for the aircraft suddenly diving, is that the tailplane stalled. AIBN has not found other explanations for this than slush spray from the runway and falling snow and sleet settled on the tailplane's leading edge and underside during taxi and take-off. This contamination is presumed to have frozen to ice. 2. The aircraft's anti and de-icing systems on the wings and tailplane were switched on, but the tailplane de-icing system had completed a ""cycle"" before take-off and was in rest mode during take-off. In the assessment by AIBN, the aircraft's anti- and de-icing systems were not suitable to remove the type of ice and snow that had most likely settled on the aircraft's tailplane. The aircraft should have been de-iced before take-off, in line with the company's de-icing procedure, to avoid potential consequences of contamination on the tailplane. 3. This accident shows the significance of good crew resource management (CRM) in the cockpit when an unexpected and extreme flight situation occurs. In this instance, the First Officer's situational awareness and initial pull-out contributed to the aircraft not crashing.METAR: 15:20 UTC / 16:20 local time: ENGM 111520Z 03005KT 350V100 4200 -SN BR OVC004 00/M01 Q0965 TEMPO 2500 -SN BKN006=15:50 UTC / 16:50 local time: ENGM 111550Z 03005KT 010V070 6000 -SNRA OVC004 00/M00 Q0965 TEMPO 3000 -SN=16:20 UTC / 17:20 local time: ENGM 111620Z 02007KT 350V050 6000 -SN SCT004 BKN007 00/M01 Q0965 TEMPO 3000 -SN=16:50 UTC / 17:50 local time: ENGM 111650Z 36006KT 5000 -RA BR SCT002 BKN015 00/M01 Q0965 TEMPO 3000 -SNRA BR BKN008=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIBN Report number: SL 2020/03 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years Download report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) Flyger83; 21 November 2009 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All four crew members and 35 persons on the ground were killed. Flight 6491 departed Hong Kong on a cargo service to Istanbul, carrying a load of 85618 kgs. An en route refueling and crew change stop was planned at Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. Weather at Bishkek was poor with winds from 60Â°at 1 m/s and a visibility (RVR) of 400m at the beginning of the runway; 350m at the mid-point and 400m at the end of the runway. Vertical visibility was 50 m. Air temperature was -9Â°C, dew point -10Â°C, pressure (QNH) was 1023,9 hPa. The initial descent towards Bishkek was normal. The crew contacted Approach Control at 07:06 hours and were cleared for a descent to FL060 as per TOKPA 1 STAR (Standard terminal arrival route). The aircraft overflew the TOPKA reporting point at 07:11 at FL092 while in descent. According to the approach chart, FL060 or above should be reached when overflying TOKPA. Shortly afterwards the controller cleared the flight for an ILS approach to runway 26. At 07:12 the controller cleared the crew for further descent to altitude 3400 ft. The aircraft was meanwhile crossing FL074. The crew was busy monitoring the flight altitude and was aware they were higher than the STAR chart. The localizer was capture at 3600 ft agl. At that time the altitude should have been 1345 ft agl (3400 ft amsl). At 07:15:21 after the crew confirmed capturing the localizer, the flight was handed over to Tower Control. At a distance of 1.7 nm the aircraft reached 3400 ft amsl and the ALT HOLD OPER autopilot mode was engaged longitudinally. At that point the flight was already over 400 ft above the glideslope. The glideslope mode was armed (G/S MODE ARM), but the glideslope was not captured. At 07:15:31 while the aircraft was in level flight at 3400 ft amsl Outer Marker overflight was recorded (as per the approach chart Outer Marker overflight altitude is 2800 ft amsl).  A glideslope signal was captured at 07:15:52, at that time the aircraft was almost over VOR/DME MANAS at a distance of approximately 1.1 nm from the runway 26 threshold, at an angle of approximately 9Â°. However, as per the approach chart, the rated glideslope angle is 3Â°. The aircraft automatically initiated descent with a vertical speed of up to 1425 ft/min. Six seconds after the glideslope capture LAND 3 autoland status annunciation was recorded. The crew called out the annunciation. At 07:16:01 at 3300 ft amsl the aircraft crossed the Middle Marker (as per the approach chart MM overflight altitude is 2290 ft amsl). After the glideslope descent was initiated the glideslope pointer was fluctuating within - 4 to + 4 dots. At 07:16:07, at 3150 ft amsl, AP CAUTION and FMA FAULT 2 events were recorded. These events were continuously recorded almost until the end of the flight. An FMA FAULT 2 means that the autopilot can no longer track the actual glideslope, but will track a constant 3Â° glide path until a valid glideslope signal is regained or until the crew intervenes by disengaging the autopilot or initiating a go-around. As the aircraft was descending LAND 3 status degraded to LAND 2, which was confirmed by the crew callout. LAND 2 means that the autopilot flight director system redundancy is reduced to the use of only two of the three autopilots. The EGPWS 'Glideslope' alert was then triggered 5 times.  At 07:17:04 the flight crossed the runway 26 departure end at a height of about 110 ft. Decision height was 99 ft. The FO then called ""Minimums"" and the captain informed that there was no visual contact and called to go-around. At 58 ft radar altitude the TOGA switch was pushed and engine power increased. 3.5 seconds after the TOGA switch had been pushed the aircraft hit slightly upsloping terrain and obstacles. The ground speed at the time of impact was 165 kt. The maximum recorded vertical acceleration was 6 g. Initial impact occurred at a distance of approximately 930 m from the runway 26 departure end. It collided with a concrete airport fence and rolled into a holiday village. The aircraft broke up and spilt fuel caught fire. Conclusion: The cause of the Boeing 747-412F TC-MCL aircraft accident was the missing control of the crew over the aircraft position in relation to the glideslope during the automatic approach, conducted at night in the weather conditions, suitable for ICAO CAT II landing, and as a result, the measures to perform a go-around, not taken in due time with the aircraft, having a significant deviation from the established approach chart, which led to the controlled flight impact with terrain (CFIT) at the distance of Â930 m beyond the end of the active RWY. The contributing factors were, most probably, the following: - the insufficient pre-flight briefing of the flight crew members for the flight to Manas aerodrome (Bishkek), regarding the approach charts, as well as the non-optimal decisions taken by the crew when choosing the aircraft descent parameters, which led to the arrival at the established approach chart reference point at a considerably higher flight altitude; - the lack of the crew's effective measures to decrease the aircraft vertical position and its arrival at the established approach chart reference point while the crew members were aware of the actual aircraft position being higher than required by the established chart; - the lack of the requirements in the Tower controllers' job instructions to monitor for considerable aircraft position deviations from the established charts while the pertinent technical equipment for such monitoring was available; - the excessive psycho-emotional stress of the crew members caused by the complicated approach conditions (night time, CAT II landing, long-lasting working hours) and their failure to eliminate the flight altitude deviations during a long time period. Additionally, the stress level could have been increased due to the crew's (especially the PIC's) highly emotional discussion of the ATC controllers' instructions and actions. Moreover, the ATC controllers' instructions and actions were in compliance with the established operational procedures and charts; - the lack of the crew members' monitoring for crossing the established navigational reference points (the glideslope capture point, the LOM and LIM reporting points); - the crew's failure to conduct the standard operational procedure which calls for altitude verification at the FAF/FAP, which is stated in the FCOM and the airline's OM. On the other hand, the Jeppesen Route Manual, used by the crew, contains no FAF/FAP in the RWY 26 approach chart; - the onboard systems' ""capture"" of the false glideslope beam with the angle of Â9Â°; - the design features of the Boeing 747-400 aircraft type regarding the continuation of the aircraft approach descent in the automatic mode with the constant descent angle of 3Â° (the inertial path) with the maintained green indication of the armed automatic landing mode (regardless of the actual aircraft position in relation to the RWY) while the aircraft systems detected that the glideslope signal was missing (after the glideslope signal ""capture""). With that, the crew received the designed annunciation, including the aural and visual caution alerts; - the absence of the red warning alert for the flight crew in case of a ""false"" glideslope capture and the transition to the inertial mode trajectory, which would require immediate control actions from the part of the crew; - the lack of monitoring from the part of the crew over the aircraft position in regard to the approach chart, including the monitoring by means of the Navigation Display (ND), engaged in the MAP mode; - the crew's failure to conduct the Airline's Standard Operational Procedures (SOPs), regarding the performance of the go-around procedure in case the ""AUTOPILOT"" (the AP switching to the inertial mode) and ""GLIDESLOPE"" (the EGPWS annunciation of the significant glideslope deviation) alerts during the automatic CAT II landing at true heights below 1000 ft (with no visual reference established with either the runway environment or with the lighting system); - the delayed actions for initiating the go-aroundMETAR: 01:00 UTC / 07:00 local time: UCFM 160100Z VRB01MPS 0050 R26/0300N FZFG VV001 M09/M10 Q1023 R26/19//60 NOSIG01:30 UTC / 07:30 local time: UCFM 160130Z VRB01MPS 0150 R26/0550 FZFG VV001 M09/M10 Q1024 R26/19//60 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: Other false glideslope-related incidents History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  2 December 2011 9V-SFL Singapore Airlines Cargo 0 Singapore-Changi International Airport (SIN/WSSS) min Runway excursion Location  Images: photo (c) Nataev; Bishkek-Manas International Airport (FRU); 16 January 2017; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) MAK; Bishkek-Manas International Airport (FRU); January 2017 photo (c) MAK; Bishkek-Manas International Airport (FRU); January 2017 photo (c) MAK; Bishkek-Manas International Airport (FRU); January 2017 photo (c) MAK; Bishkek-Manas International Airport (FRU); 20 January 2017 photo (c) MAK; Bishkek-Manas International Airport (FRU); 20 January 2017 photo (c) MAK; 20 January 2017 photo (c) MAK; 20 January 2017 photo (c) Tomoaki Kongou; Hong Kong-Chek Lap Kok International Airport (HKG/VHHH); 11 September 2016; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) Kelvin Jahae; Maastricht/Aachen Airport (MST/EHBK); 11 January 2017; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) Claude Davet; Brussel-Zaventem Airport (BRU/EBBR) [OO]; 15 March 2008; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) Merijn Passchier; Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS/EHAM); 31 August 2005; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot reported that after departure, he retracted the landing gear and heard a ""thud"" sound. The landing gear ""unsafe"" light was illuminated and the left landing gear light remained illuminated green, an indication that it was still extended despite the landing gear handle being in the retracted position. When reaching his initial destination of Sidney, the pilot performed a low pass over the runway to enable maintenance personnel on the ground do a visual assessment. A mechanic stated that the nose gear was extended. The pilot diverted to Billings and the air traffic control personnel confirmed observing the nose gear extended at a 45-degree angle. The pilot further stated that he aligned with runway 28R and just prior to touch down, he feathered the propellers and decreased the airspeed. During touchdown, the right gear collapsed and the airplane came to rest on the centerline. As a result of the impact, the right aileron and right wing spar sustained damage.

The pilot and the passenger were fatally injured.  A witness observed the airplane takeoff from runway 11L and rapidly pitch up in the initial climb. At an altitude between 100-150 feet above the runway, the airplane suddenly yawed to the left while maintaining a nose-up pitch attitude. The airplane then appeared to slow down such that he believed it was about to stall. The left wing dropped, and the airplane rolled left and continued as the nose dropped and the airplane struck the ground inverted. Another witness described the airplane yawing from left to right while climbing. The airplane then rolled left and eventually became inverted, in a manner he described as similar to a barrel roll. The airplane then exited his field of view. After impact, the airplane slid about 650 feet across the ramp on a 060-degree magnetic heading before it collided with an 8-feet tall concrete wall. No evidence was found of any preexisting mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation of the airplane. Toxicology testing revealed the pilot's use of multiple psychoactive substances including marijuana, venlafaxine, amphetamine, pseudoephedrine, clonazepam, and pheniramine. The wide variety of psychoactive effects of these medications precludes predicting the specific effects of their use in combination. However, it is likely that the pilot was impaired by the effects of the combination of psychoactive substances he was using and that those effects contributed to his loss of control. The investigation was unable to obtain medical records regarding any underlying neuropsychiatric disease(s); therefore, whether these may have contributed to the accident circumstances could not be determined.

The pilot and his passenger suffered fatal injuries. The aircraft was flying a display during the City of Perth Australia Day Skyworks 2017 event. It departed Serpentine Airport at 16:28 and proceeded along the coast towards Perth. A holding pattern was flown to the east of Garden Island at an altitude of approximately 1600 feet, waiting to fly a display. At 16:50 it continued flying north towards Perth in company with a Cessna Caravan amphibian. Both aircraft conducted a series of circuits that included low-level fly-pasts of the Langley Park foreshore. After the second fly-past, the pilot of VH-CQA commenced a third circuit, while the Caravan departed the area. As part of the third circuit, the pilot of the Mallard flew in an easterly direction, parallel with the South Perth foreshore, before commencing a left turn. This would have facilitated a third pass in a westerly direction along the Langley Park foreshore. During the left turn, the aircraft rolled left and pitched nose down, consistent with an aerodynamic stall. The aircraft collided with the water and broke up. The pilot and passenger were fatally injured. Contributing factors: - The pilot returned the aircraft to the display area for a third pass in a manner contrary to the approved inbound procedure and which required the use of increased manoeuvring within a confined area to establish the aircraft on the display path. - During the final positioning turn for the third pass, the aircraft aerodynamically stalled at an unrecoverable height. - The pilot's decision to carry a passenger on a flight during the air display was contrary to the Instrument of Approval issued by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority for this air display and increased the severity of the accident consequence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ATSB Report number: AO-2017-013 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: The Courier Mail, 26-1-2017  Flightradar24  ATSB   Location  Images: photo (c) Jim Woodrow; Swan River, Perth, WA; 26 January 2017 photo (c) Jim Woodrow; Swan River, Perth, WA; 26 January 2017 photo (c) Flightaware / Google; Swan River, Perth, WA; 26 January 2017 photo (c) ATSB / Google; Swan River, Perth, WA; 26 January 2017 photo (c) Robert Frola; Watts Bridge Airport (YWSG); 10 April 2016 photo (c) Martin Watson; Watts Bridge Airport (YWSG); September 2015 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot reported that the preflight and enroute portions of the flight were uneventful. The flight was established on the localizer for the approach to runway 28R, which was dry. Flaps were set to the approach position and the landing gear were extended and showed ""3 green."" After touchdown, he heard noises, and the airplane started to sink. After the airplane came to a stop on the right side of the runway, the pilots noticed that the gear handle was up. The pilot stated, ""How did the gear handle get up?"" He then placed the handle to the down position.  An inspector with the Federal Aviation Administration responded to the accident site and examined the airplane. Structural damage to the fuselage was confirmed. All three landing gear were found in a partially extended position. Skid marks from all three tires were observed on the runway, leading up the main wreckage. Both propeller assemblies were damaged due to contact with the runway. The pressure vessel was compromised from contact with a propeller blade. The nose landing gear actuator was forced up, into the nose gear well and penetrated the upper nose skin.

The aircraft took off from the BogotÃ¡ Airport at 15:50 hours local time. The flight was normal and the aircraft was cleared for the VOR approach to runway 21. The controller notified the crew of a 350Â° wind at 4 knots and a wet runway. At 16:57, the aircraft touched down abeam taxiway Alpha. Immediately afterwards, when the deceleration began, with the application of the reverses, an explosion occurred. The crew observed that the auto-braking system was not operating, so they decided to deactivate it and execute manual braking. Both captain and first officer failed to get a response when applying the brakes so the captain decided to activate the reversers again with 400 metres of runway remaining. The aircraft continued to roll and crossed the threshold stopping in the safety zone, twenty meters from the runway threshold. Approximately one minute after the plane stopped, the crew opened the cargo door and evacuated by their own means; the four occupants were unharmed. Probable cause(s) The investigation determined that the accident was caused by the following causal factors: Poor maintenance procedures of the aircraft operator, by not applying complete and adequate corrective actions to determine the root cause of repeated tire failure. Brake system failure as a result of a break in the hydraulic lines and harness housed in the right landing gear compartment caused by pieces of rubber from tire No. 4 bursting during the landing run. Bursting of tire No. 4 due to the over bending action it suffered as a result of being inflated and over inflated repeatedly, due to different reports of low tire pressure. Runway departure during the deceleration during the landing manoeuvre in Leticia. Contributing Factors Inadequate risk management of the Operator, since the repeated reports of discrepancies were not known or dealt with by its Operational Safety Management area. Poor conditions in the safety zone, in the extension of the Leticia aerodrome's header 03, whose unevenness and flooding contributed to the damage to the aircraft.METAR: 00:00 UTC / 19:00 local time: SKLT 290000Z 00000KT 8000 -DZ BKN010 25/25 A2984 RMK AD OPER IMC21:00 UTC / 16:00 local time: SKLT 282100Z 00000KT 9999 SCT010 BKN015 27/24 A298222:00 UTC / 17:00 local time: SKLT 282200Z 32003KT 9999 -DZ SCT010 BKN015 27/24 A2980 RERA23:00 UTC / 18:00 local time: SKLT 282300Z 00000KT 9999 -RA BKN010 BKN080 26/24 A2986 RMK AD OPER IMCAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: Aerocivil Report number: COL-17-05-GIA Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Aerocivil   Location  Images: photo (c) Leslie Snelleman; Sydney-Kingsford Smith International Airport, NSW (SYD/YSSY); 20 January 2007 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

About three minutes into the flight there was a failure of the left main and essential bus that prompted a return to Freeport. Upon landing on runway 06, there was a collapse of the left main gear and subsequently a runway excursion occurred. Minor injuries were reported to passengers. The Air Accident Investigation Department has determined that the probable cause of this accident was ineffective crew resource management and an unstable approach which led to the failure of the left main landing gear upon touchdown. Contributing factors to this accident includes; inadequate systems knowledge, lack of situational awareness and failure to diagnose and remedy multiple system failures in a timely manner resulted in compound failures being escalated to an emergency. The apparent rush to get on the ground without exploring other possible options to identify and verify landing gear security also contributed to the severity of this accident. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS - Ineffective CRM, complacency and a complete departure from company standard operating procedures and regulatory requirements were evidently a contributing factor in this accident. - Inadequate training and systems knowledge of both airman greatly contributed to the accident. - Hurried approach to get on the ground and failure to explore all available options to remedy the gear unsafe situation encountered was also a contributory factor.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAID Bahamas Report number: A17-000602 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Air Accident Investigation Department of The Bahamas   Location  Images: photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Nassau-Lynden Pindling International Airport (NAS/MYNN); 03 January 2015 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The captain tried to do a recovery manoeuvre by applying differential power, reverse, and braking, however these manoeuvres were unsuccessful. The left wing came into contact with the airport building, sheering off the left winglet and wing tip down to the wing rib located below the wing fence. The aircraft continued past the building before coming to rest with the winglet and debris resting behind it. The 4 passengers and 2 crew members disembarked without any injury. Company maintenance inspected the aircraft and concluded that there was no structural damage. During this inspection, the engine rigging was checked to ensure that power management was not a factor in this event. No major discrepancies were found and ground runs were normal.

After landing on runway 36R, the flight crew elected to stop on the taxiway due to the fuel leak, where passengers were evacuated and bused them to the terminal. Post flight examination of the wing found damage substantial damage to the leading edge slats, slat tracks, flaps, and front spar of the right wing. Probable Cause: collision with a deer during takeoff.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA17CA064 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  27 June 2018 N709PS PSA Airlines, opf American Eagle 0 Harrisburg International Airport, PA (MDT/KMDT) min 26 March 2021 N709PS PSA Airlines, opf American Eagle 0 North Canton, Ohio min Windscreen cracks or failure 29 January 2025 N709PS American Eagle, opb PSA Airlines 64 near Washington-Ronald Reagan National Airport, DC (DCA/KDCA) w/o Mid-air collision Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft was conducting a charter passenger flight from Essendon Airport to King Island, Tasmania.  The four passengers arrived at the terminal at 08:41 and were escorted by the pilot directly to the aircraft. At 08:49, the left engine was started and, shortly after, the right engine was started. At 08:53, the pilot requested a taxi clearance for King Island, with five persons onboard, under the instrument flight rules. He was cleared to taxi to holding point Tango for runway 17. At 08:58, ATC cleared the flight for take-off on runway 17 with departure instructions to turn right onto a heading of 200Â°. The pilot read back the instruction and commenced the takeoff roll. The aircraftÂs take-off roll along runway 17 was longer than expected. Witnesses familiar with the aircraft type observed a noticeable yaw to the left after the aircraft became airborne. The aircraft entered a relatively shallow climb and the landing gear remained down. The shallow climb was followed by a substantial left sideslip, while maintaining a roll attitude of less than 10Â° to the left. Airservices ADS-B data indicated the aircraft reached a maximum height of approximately 160 ft above ground level while tracking in an arc to the left of the runway centreline . The aircraftÂs track began diverging to the left of the runway centreline before rotation and the  Following the sustained left sideslip, the aircraft began to descend and at 08:58:48 the pilot transmitted on the Essendon Tower frequency repeating the word 'MAYDAY' seven times in rapid succession. Approximately 10 seconds after the aircraft became airborne, and 2 seconds after the transmission was completed, the aircraft collided with the roof of a building in the Essendon Airport Bulla Road Precinct - Retail Outlet Centre, coming to rest in a loading area at the rear of the building. Contributing factors - The aircraft's rudder trim was likely in the full nose-left position at the commencement of the take-off. - The aircraft's full nose-left rudder trim setting was not detected by the pilot prior to take-off. - Following a longer than expected ground roll, the pilot took-off with full left rudder trim selected. This configuration adversely affected the aircraft's climb performance and controllability, resulting in a collision with terrain. Other factors that increased risk: - The flight check system approval process did not identify that the incorrect checklist was nominated in the operatorÂs procedures manual and it did not ensure the required checks, related to the use of the cockpit voice recorder, were incorporated. - The aircraft's cockpit voice recorder did not record the accident flight, resulting in a valuable source of safety related information not being available. - The aircraft's maximum take-off weight was likely exceeded by about 240 kilograms. - Two of the four buildings within the Bulla Road Precinct Retail Outlet Centre exceeded the obstacle limitation surface (OLS) for Essendon Airport, however, the OLS for the departure runway was not infringed and VH-ZCR did not collide with those buildings.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ATSB Report number: AO-2017-024 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: ATSB  The Age   Location  Images: photo (c) ATSB; Melbourne-Essendon Airport, VIC (MEB); 21 February 2017 photo (c) ATSB; Melbourne-Essendon Airport, VIC (MEB); 21 February 2017 photo (c) ATSB; Melbourne-Essendon Airport, VIC (MEB); 21 February 2017 photo (c) Alec Wilson; Melbourne-Essendon Airport, VIC (MEB); 24 November 2014; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

On February 23, 2017, the aircraft was due to operate a return flight from Isle Of Man-Ronaldsway Airport (IOM) to Belfast City Airport, Northern Ireland. The scheduled departure time was 07:15 UTC and the return flight was scheduled to arrive back at IOM at 08:50. Overnight and into the morning of the 23 February, Storm Doris underwent explosive cyclogenesis. The centre of the storm moved rapidly through Northern Ireland in the early hours, across northern England and out into the North Sea by the early afternoon. Strong winds were forecast for the area. The surface wind at Belfast, where runways 04 and 22 were available, was reported at 06:20 to be from 230Â° at 9 kt but, because they received no TAF for this destination, the pilots selected two alternate airports; Belfast International Airport and IOM. The latest weather information at IOM showed a wind from 230Â° at 32 kt gusting to 45 kt, creating a maximum crosswind component of 22 kt. The relevant maximum demonstrated crosswind component for the Let L-410 is 19.4 kt and this was included in the ÂPerformance LimitationsÂ section of the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) but the aircraft operator did not apply a limiting component of crosswind to its operations. The only wind limit that was applied and used by the crew was 45 kt for ground operation. When the wind changed to 260Â° at 39, gusting to 55 kt, the flight was delayed because this exceeded the ground operation limit, Departure At 07:50 the crew learnt the wind was from 290Â° at 31 G 40 kt and as both these more recent reports were within the ground operation limit, they decided to depart, with 550 kg of fuel on board.  Three passengers boarded and the aircraft taxied at 08:10. Shortly afterwards, at the request of Belfast City ATC, the crew were informed that the wind was from 320Â° at 31 G 46 kt, and IOM ATC asked the crew for their intentions because Belfast City ATC had reported no other known aircraft movements. The crew elected to continue the flight and took off on runway 26 at 08:23 hrs, when the reported wind was from 290Â° at 21 G 41 kt. The co-pilot was the Pilot Flying (PF) and the commander was Pilot Not Flying (PNF). No difficulties were encountered en route to Belfast. When the PNF contacted Belfast City ATC, he was told radar vectoring was available for an ILS approach to runway 04 and that the wind was now from 320Â° at 28 G 43 kt. The PNF informed ATC they would make one approach but would go around if the approach was not stable. The crew reported afterwards that they experienced continuous moderate turbulence during the latter part of the approach. The final wind check, given after they had been cleared to land, was from 320Â° at 35 kt. They judged that the aircraft operatorÂs stable approach criteria were met until the aircraft passed over the runway threshold, when turbulence de-stabilised the aircraft and they initiated a go-around. ATC reported that the aircraft went around from approximately 20 ft above the runway at 08:58 hrs and climbed straight ahead to 3,000 ft amsl, the standard missed approach procedure. The aircraft continued heading northeast until 09:01 hrs when the PNF informed ATC they would not make a second approach and would return to IOM. Return Once level at FL070, the PNF listened to the ATIS for the IOM, which stated runway 26 was in use, it was wet, and detailed the 0850 METAR, which noted that the wind was from 290Â° at 28 kt. The PF briefed for an approach with the flaps set to 18Â°, and a target VREF of 105 kt; with a ""slightly right crosswind"". After the brief was completed he commented on the intercom that the wind was ""not so challenging"" at IOM but shortly after this ATC provided a special weather observation, timed at 09:12 hrs, which stated the wind was now from 310Â° at 41 kt and gusting between 22 and 53 kt. When asked by ATC if they wished to make an approach, the PNF replied ""of course"". The crew accepted radar vectoring for an ILS approach to runway 26, with the co-pilot remaining as PF. Before the aircraft was directed towards its final approach, ATC reported the wind was from 310Â° at 43 kt but gusting between 23 and 63 kt. At 09:24, after the aircraft had become established on the ILS centreline and glideslope, ATC radioed clearance to land, with a reported wind of 300Â° at 41 kt but gusting between 31 and 63 kt. While receiving this message, the crew were also presented with an aural ""glideslope"" caution and immediately after this the PF declared ""1,000 ft stabilised"". While the PNF was adjusting the propeller rpm, another aural ""glideslope"" caution was annunciated and the PF immediately stated ""correcting"". Following an automatically generated message stating the aircraft was at 500 ft agl, one further ""glideslope"" caution was annunciated and the PF responded saying ""correcting, runway in sight"". The final wind check provided by ATC, approximately 35 seconds before the aircraft touched down, was from 300Â° at 48 kt, but gusting between 32 kt and 63 kt.  Landing Given the environmental conditions, ATC was concerned for the safety of the aircraft and its occupants when it landed, so the airfield Rescue and Fire Fighting Service (RFFS) had been placed on alert with two vehicles facing towards the runway, approximately 200 m from the touchdown zone. During the aircraftÂs approach, ATC discussed the situation with the Isle of Man Civil Aviation Administration because another of the same operatorÂs aircraft had been blown onto its wingtip while taxiing in 2007, in winds greater than 45 kt, and both parties knew 45 kt was now the operatorÂs maximum ground operation limit. As the aircraft crossed the threshold it seemed unstable and it rolled considerably, causing the tip of the left wing (the downwind wing) to tilt down until it seemed in close proximity to the runway, before the wheels made first contact. The aircraft then bounced and rolled left again before touching down for a second time, on all three wheels. After travelling along the runway for approximately 20 m, the right mainwheel was seen to lift off the ground and nearby RFFS witnesses estimated the left wingtip rolled to within one metre of the runway surface. The crew seemed aware of this roll because, approximately nine seconds after touchdown, the PF stated ""ailerons...good...too much roll"".  After landing the commander took control and the co-pilot commented ""taxi carefully with the wind"". ATC then stated the surface wind was from 300Â° at 47 kt, but gusting between 32 kt and 63 kt and asked if they wished to taxi or to hold on the runway. The crew replied ""we will try and taxi and if we can make it we will vacate, otherwise we need to leave the aircraft here"". The crew then accepted taxi instructions directing them towards the terminal but, 45 seconds later, as the aircraft was leaving the runway, ATC radioed to the crew, ""direction from Isle of Man CAA, hold position."" The aircraft stopped facing into the wind. Both ATC and the Isle of Man Civil Aviation Administration later indicated that they were concerned that if the aircraft continued to taxi with the wind gusting to 63 kt an accident could occur.  RFFS vehicles were positioned around the aircraft, to provide some screening from the wind, and a bus transferred the three uninjured passengers to the terminal building. The aircraft was later tied down until the wind subsided. Conclusion: The prime causal factor in this serious incident was the decision to land with a maximum crosswind component of 40 kt, which is approximately twice the maximum demonstrated certification value of 19.4 kt. In the view of the aircraft operator, there was no specific crosswind limit the crew needed to consider when deciding whether to operate the service or not. However, the OM Part A refers to a crosswind limit when it states: ÂFor planning purposes an aerodrome shall be considered below minimum if the steady crosswind exceeds the prescribed limitations.Â and other evidence from the AFM and the OM indicates that the maximum demonstrated crosswind component of 19.4 kt was limiting. Several contributory factors were also apparent: 1) By only studying weather reports for six airfields and without referring to any meteorology charts, the crew had insufficient information to assess the prevailing weather conditions en route and the stormÂs path. 2) The aircraft operator believed that a valid TAF could be disregarded upon the subsequent issue of a METAR that included a TREND forecast. 3) The aircraft operator did not provide adequate oversight to a flight in airspace affected by this storm. The commander did not refer to the available weather forecast charts and neither the OCC nor the FOM reviewed the situation with him, or suggested he seek guidance from the duty forecaster. 4) The fuel figures presented on the OFP did not account for the correct level of contingency fuel and did not allow for a realistic alternate routing. The aircraft had sufficient fuel for the sector, but the crew did not have as much extra fuel on-board as they believed they had, and the OM offered little guidance on the carriage of extra fuel when there was a possibility of widespread, adverse weather conditions. 5) The OFP only showed navigational and fuel information for the second of two selected alternates. However, the two Belfast airports are in close proximity so the lack of navigational information for the routing to the first alternate may not have been problematic in this instance. 6) The CVR evidence, that evolving threats did not precipitate verbal discussion between the pilots, indicates they had not been effectively trained in respect to CRM, and to threat management in particular. The OM appeared to lack guidance concerning the evaluation and management of threats, problem solving and decision making. 7) The approach became unstable before visual flight conditions were achieved, but the crew did not discuss this, and the required SOPs were not followed. 8) The limiting airspeed for flight with gear down and for flight with flaps extended was exceeded but no corrective action was taken. 9) The crew began taxiing the aircraft in a wind which was stronger than the wind which blew a similar aircraft onto its wingtip at IOM in 2007 and which exceeded the ground operation limit introduced after the 2007 accident.METAR: 06:20 UTC / 06:20 local time: EGNS 230620Z 23032G45KT 7000 -RA FEW012 SCT022 BKN030 07/04 Q0977 BECMG 31017KT07:20 UTC / 07:20 local time: EGNS 230720Z 25033G47KT 220V290 3000 RA FEW005 BKN008 OVC015 06/05 Q0973 NOSIG08:20 UTC / 08:20 local time: EGAC 230820Z 31029G46KT 9999 -SHRA FEW009 BKN012 03/01 Q098108:20 UTC / 08:20 local time: EGNS 230820Z 29029G42KT 5000 -RA FEW006 BKN009 BKN022 07/05 Q0975 TEMPO 3000 RA BKN007 [approx departure time]09:20 UTC / 09:20 local time: EGAC 230920Z 31023G40KT 9999 -RADZ FEW010 BKN014 04/02 Q098609:20 UTC / 09:20 local time: EGNS 230920Z 30042G56KT 4000 RA FEW005 BKN011 BKN033 05/03 Q0979 TEMPO 3000 BKN006 [approx landing time]10:20 UTC / 09:20 local time: EGNS 231020Z 30042G58KT 9999 -RA FEW009 BKN015 OVC025 05/02 Q0984 TEMPO 5000 RA BKN00611:20 UTC / 09:20 local time: EGNS 231120Z 30043G56KT 9000 -RA FEW012 SCT016 BKN028 06/03 Q0986 TEMPO 5000 BKN006Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: EW/C2017/02/04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  29 November 2018 OK-LAZ Van Air Europe, opf Trade Air 0 Dubrovnik Airport (LDDU) non Wrong runway/taxiway landing Location  Images: photo (c) AAIB; Isle Of Man-Ronaldsway Airport (IOM); February 2017 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft departed Edinburgh, Scotland, on a scheduled passenger service to Amsterdam at 14:21 UTC. About 15:22 UTC the aircraft entered a holding pattern over the North Sea off the western coast of the Netherlands because landing runways available were limited at Schiphol because of the strong surface wind.  It left the holding about 15:38 UTC and positioned for an ILS approach to runway 22. During the approach to Schiphol, at approximately 16:30 hours, ATC requested the crew to hold over reporting point SUGOL at flight level (FL) 110 for 20 minutes because landing runways available were limited at Schiphol because of the strong surface wind. ATIS information ÂKiloÂ reported winds from direction 240Â° with a velocity of 35 knots, gusting to 40 knots. METAR information reported winds at 37 knots gusting to 46 at 15.55 (UTC, 16.55 local time). From SUGOL the crew initially received radar vectors inbound Schiphol. They then were cleared to intercept the Instrument Landing System (ILS) for runway 22. The ILS for the approach to runway 22 was intercepted at 18 NM.  During the descent, at 15:49 UTC, the autopilot disengaged because of gusting winds in the approach and was reengaged by the crew shortly after. The arrival was flown in speed control mode with an airspeed of 170 knots. Final speed was selected at 130 knots, i.e. normal landing threshold speed (VREF) plus 10 knots to compensate for the gusting winds. At around 15:51 UTC, approximately 5.5 NM from the runway touchdown point, the landing gear was selected down, giving three greens indication in the cockpit shortly after. The crew confirmed the indication, 15 degrees flaps were selected and de-icing systems were selected. The crew then changed radio frequency to Schiphol Tower and received a clearance for landing on runway 22. The air traffic controller reported the wind from direction 240 degrees with speeds of 36 knots gusting to 48 knots. The crew finished the before landing checklist. They then selected 5 degrees flaps and selected gear down. They confirmed Âice protection onÂ, Âlanding gear three greensÂ, selected 15 degrees flaps and checked Âbleed air onÂ. At an altitude of 300 feet the flight crew disengaged the autopilot for landing. On short final the crew noticed the PAPI showing they were on the glide path. Although the pilots were aware they would encounter strong winds during landing, including crosswinds, the wind conditions were not extreme and were not above the aircraftÂs limitations. Short final was flown under crosswind conditions, with the nose of the aircraft about 20 degrees right of centre line. Just before touch down the pilot flying aligned the nose of the aircraft with the runway centreline and lowered the right wing to compensate for the crosswind, causing the right-hand main wheel to touch the runway first. The aircraft touched down at 15:54 UTC. The crew considered the landing to be firm, but not hard. Almost immediately after touch down the crew noticed the right wing dropping, and a red warning light appeared on the landing gear panel in the cockpit. The right-hand propeller, right-hand engine nacelle, lower fuselage, wing tip and aileron collided with the runway and the aircraft continued for several hundred meters before coming to a complete stop. This resulted in damage to the right hand propeller, the lower fuselage structure and right-hand outboard wing tip. The right-hand fuselage was also damaged due to fragments from the right-hand propeller and stone strikes. The left-hand main landing gear and nose gear remained extended. The crew transmitted a MAYDAY call and after coming to a complete stop the cabin attendants started evacuating the passengers via the two aft doors. The crew then shut down the aircraft in accordance with the checklist. As a precaution, they also pulled the circuit breakers from the flight data and cockpit voice recorders. During the accident and following evacuation no-one was injured. Conclusions: - Maintenance was performed on the night before the day of the mishap flight, during maintenance the MLG brace was replaced. The maintenance crew stated they did not find anything unusual during the installation of the brace. - After the accident, the newly installed stabilizer brace showed no deformation, nor did the attachment lugs on the yoke or the forward nacelle. - The PSEU showed several fault codes which were consistent with the condition of the aircraft during the approach and after the incident. - One of the MLG down lock sensors was found unreliable. The faulty sensor prevented the PSEU logic from closing the aft RH MLG doors and activating the unlock actuator. - The unlock actuator not being activated prevented the brace being aided to maintain its over centred position by hydraulic pressure. - The RH MLG yoke was found deformed. Analyses, and the fact no deformation was present on the stabilizer brace assembly, indicate that the deformation on the yoke was present prior to touchdown at Schiphol, and that this deformation was caused when NO stabilizer brace assembly was installed. - The deformation of the yoke placed the RH MLG in a condition outside the certification state, thereby exposing the RH MLG stabilizer brace assembly to the potential of unlocking. - The bent yoke caused friction in the MLG yoke and brace combination, which prevented at least one of the two stabilizer brace apex joints from achieving an over centre condition when the MLG was extended prior to landing. Although not designed for this, not hydraulically activating the unlock actuator after the gear was in the down position, prevented the brace assembly from being retained into over centre position. - Despite the fact the gear was not fully locked, and outside certification condition, three green lights indicated to the crew that the gear was down and locked. Although not noticed by the flying crew, the amber caution light indicating the aft RH MLG were open, most likely was lit during landing. - The combination of friction caused by the bent yoke, and faulty sensors preventing the unlock actuator to be activated, caused a situation whereby the stabilizer brace of the RH MLG did not get into over centre position causing an instable situation, despite the three LG green lights illuminated. - During an asymmetric (rolled) touchdown in Amsterdam torsion loads were applied to the MLG, and the MLG strut collapsed almost immediately after touchdown of the RH MLG, causing the accident to happen.METAR: 14:55 UTC / 15:55 local time: EHAM 231455Z 23034G48KT 180V260 9999 FEW022 09/03 Q0985 TEMPO 7000 -RA BKN02015:25 UTC / 16:25 local time: EHAM 231525Z 24037G51KT 9999 -RA FEW020 SCT032 08/04 Q0985 TEMPO 7000 BKN02015:55 UTC / 16:55 local time: EHAM 231555Z 24031G46KT 210V270 9999 -RA FEW020 SCT028 BKN037 08/04 Q0985 TEMPO 7000 BKN020Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Dutch Safety Board Report number: 2017016 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) Onderzoeksraad voor Veiligheid; Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS); 23 February 2017 photo (c) Onderzoeksraad voor Veiligheid; Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS); 23 February 2017 photo (c) Onderzoeksraad voor Veiligheid; Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS); 23 February 2017 photo (c) Onderzoeksraad voor Veiligheid; Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS); 23 February 2017 photo (c) Flightradar24; Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS); 23 February 2017 photo (c) Werner Fischdick; DÃ¼sseldorf International Airport (DUS/EDDL); 15 June 2013 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

During the pushback from Stand 1 at Manchester Airport, in dark and wet conditions, the flight deck crew felt a fore and aft jolt and heard a mechanical ""clunk"". The commander informed the headset operator who conferred with the tug driver, and then visually checked the towbar and its attachment to the tug and to the aircraft. The ground crew saw nothing abnormal and they assumed the clunk was due to the tow hitch shifting, which is a familiar occurrence. The headset operator informed the commander that all was well, and the pushback continued. In response to a request from the commander, the headset operator indicated the left engine could be started, although the aircraft had not reached the designated engine start positon for that stand. As the aircraft was halted, in preparation for being pulled forward to the release point, the headset operator approved a request from the flight deck crew to start the right engine. The commander was conscious of the aircraft beginning to move gently forward, while he was concentrating on starting the right engine. Both the tug and the headset operator were concealed from his field of view and he was not surprised when the aircraftÂs nose turned first to the right and then to the left, as if it was being lined-up on the taxiway centreline. He then heard an urgent instruction from the headset operator for the brakes to be applied, so he responded by pressing on the toe brakes before setting the park brake. The headset operator then informed him that the tug and aircraft had collided, but that nobody was injured. Both engines were then shut down. Ground crew from adjacent stands came to assist and found the towbar was still connected to both the tug and to the aircraft. The nose gear leg was rotated approximately 90Â° to the left and the tow bar was bent around the front corner of the tug. The shear pins on the towbar had fractured, and pieces were later found within the boundary of the stand, but the central retaining pin remained intact. The passengers and crew disembarked without injury from the rear right exit door. An investigation by the ground handling company showed One of the pins on this towbar had failed 16 days before the accident and only that pin had been replaced. It was also established that other maintenance procedures for the shear pins had not been followed. They had not been lubricated correctly and the training given to ground crews did not prepare them for conducting adequate serviceability checks on the pins.

He then looked down and verified that the parking brake was set, which it was, and as he was applying the brakes they locked, and the airplane came to a ""jarring stop"".  At the time of the sudden stop, the lead flight attendant (FA) was performing safety checks in the first-class galley and was thrown into the galley. After being informed of the FAs injury, the captain returned the flight to the gate where they were met by paramedics.Â  The FA was transported to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a broken rib.

The aircraft had been chartered by the University of Michigan Basketball team for a flight to a game in Washington, DC. The flight crew prepared for take-off and calculated V-speeds (V1, VR, V2) using ""Normal Thrust Takeoff"", a 10 kts headwind, and a take-off weight of 146,600 lbs. The V-speeds for this configuration were 139 kts, 142 kts, and 150 kts, respectively. However, the flight crew chose to increase VR to 150 kts to allow for more control during take-off in the presence of windshear. During takeoff roll, at 14:51:56 (about 3,000 ft down the runway) and about 138 kts of airspeed, the control column was pulled back slightly from a non-dimensional value of -7 to -5.52. The airplaneÂs left elevator followed the control input and moved from a position of -15Â° trailing edge down to -13Â° trailing edge down. The right elevator did not change and stayed at approximately -16Â° trailing edge down. At 14:52:01 a large control column input was made (151 kts and 4100 ft down the runway) to a non-dimensional 18.5 and the left elevator moves to a position near 15Â° trailing edge up. After 14:52:05 the right elevator moves to -13Â° trailing edge down, but no more. The airplane does not respond in pitch and does not rotate. The captain decided to abort the takeoff. The maximum groundspeed was 163 kts (173 kts airspeed) and the airplane began to decelerate as soon as the brakes were applied at 14:52:08. Spoilers were deployed at 14:52:10 and thrust reversers were deployed between 14:52:13 and 14:52:15. The aircraft could not be stopped on the runway. The airplaneÂs ground speed was 100 kts when it left the paved surface. The aircraft overran the end of the runway, damaged approach lights, went through the perimeter fence and crossed Tyler Road. It came to rest on grassy terrain, 345 meters past the end of the runway, with the rear fuselage across a ditch. The nose landing gear had collapsed.  Runway 23L is a 7543 ft long runway. Post-accident examination by the NTSB revealed movement of the control column in the cockpit appeared normal; the control columns were free to move, and the elevator control tabs moved as commanded. However, when investigators tried to move the elevator surfaces by hand, the left elevator moved normally, but the right elevator was jammed in a trailing edge-down position (airplane nose down). Upon further inspection, the right elevator geared tab inboard pushrod linkage was found damaged which restricted movement of the right elevator surface but allowed movement of the control tab. After the damaged components were removed, the elevator could be moved by hand. Examination of the flight data recorder data indicates that during the taxi and take-off roll, the left elevator moved normally, but the right elevator did not move. During takeoff roll, the left elevator began a large airplane nose-up movement (consistent with rotation) at an airspeed of about 152 knots and continued for five seconds to about 166 knots. There was no change in the airplane pitch attitude during this time. The airplane data then are consistent with the takeoff being rejected. The maximum recorded airspeed was about 173 knots. Review of previous flight data showed normal movement of both the left and right elevator surfaces.  The airplane flew to Ypsilanti two days before the accident. Probable Cause: ""The NTSB determines that the probable cause of this accident was the jammed condition of the airplaneÂs right elevator, which resulted from exposure to localized, dynamic wind while the airplane was parked and rendered the airplane unable to rotate during takeoff. Contributing to the accident were (1) the effect of a large structure on the gusting surface wind at the airplaneÂs parked location, which led to turbulent gust loads on the right elevator sufficient to jam it, even though the horizontal surface wind speed was below the certification design limit and maintenance inspection criteria for the airplane, and (2) the lack of a means to enable the flight crew to detect a jammed elevator during preflight checks for the Boeing MD-83 airplane. Contributing to the survivability of the accident was the captainÂs timely and appropriate decision to reject the takeoff, the check airmanÂs disciplined adherence to standard operating procedures after the captain called for the rejected takeoff, and the dimensionally compliant runway safety area where the overrun occurred.""METAR: 16:53 UTC / 11:53 local time: KYIP 081653Z 26035G50KT 10SM CLR 11/M11 A2981 RMK AO2 PK WND 26055/1639 SLP095 T0106110617:53 UTC / 12:53 local time: KYIP 081753Z A2979 RMK AO2 PK WND 24046/1656 SLPNO 58012 $19:53 UTC / 14:55 local time: KDTW 081953Z 26033G44KT 10SM FEW050 12/M14 A2980 RMK AO2 PK WND 24051/1926 SLP095 T01171144Weather for Detroit Metro Airport, 13 km east of KYIPAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NTSB/AAR-19/01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 12 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: WXYZ  FAA  M Live  NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Detroit-Willow Run Airport, MI (YIP); March 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Detroit-Willow Run Airport, MI (YIP); March 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Detroit-Willow Run Airport, MI (YIP); March 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Detroit-Willow Run Airport, MI (YIP); March 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Detroit-Willow Run Airport, MI (YIP); March 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Detroit-Willow Run Airport, MI (YIP); March 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Detroit-Willow Run Airport, MI (YIP); March 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Detroit-Willow Run Airport, MI (YIP); March 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Detroit-Willow Run Airport, MI (YIP); March 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Detroit-Willow Run Airport, MI (YIP); March 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Detroit-Willow Run Airport, MI (YIP); March 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Detroit-Willow Run Airport, MI (YIP); March 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Detroit-Willow Run Airport, MI (YIP); March 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) Google Earth; Detroit-Willow Run Airport, MI (YIP); 08 March 2017 photo (c) NTSB; Detroit-Willow Run Airport, MI (YIP); 08 March 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) Adam Moreira; New York-John F.

None of the other passengers and crew members were injured and the airplane received minor damage.   According to the operator, while enroute to DFW at FL 280, in intermittent IMC conditions at 0.74 Mach, the flight crew was deviating left of assigned course to avoid weather and was northeast of Memphis .  The seat belt sign was on and the on-board radar was not depicting any precipitation.   The aircraft experienced unexpected turbulence.  The #2 and the #4 FAs were seated in their jumpseats in the rear of the aircraft, however, their seatbelts were not fastened.  Both the #2 and the #4 FAs struck the overhead ceiling panel and fell to the floor.  No passengers reported injuries and the FAs were able to complete their duties.  Emergency Medical Service personnel met the FAs at the gate and transported to the hospital.  Both FAs were treated and released from the hospital that evening, however, the #2 FA was later diagnosed with fractures to her vertebrae.

The aircraft came to rest on the right side of the runway. The nose landing gear had collapsed and the right hand wing tip was bent. Kalaupapa Airport is an uncontrolled (nontowered) airport with a single runway and no taxiways. The pilots use a common frequency to state their intentions.  The pilot of the Grand Caravan reported that she was going to establish an approach and landing to runway 05. While on a seven-mile final, she communicated with the pilot of an airplane that was on short final for the same airport. The pilot that was on short final reported that he would report when he was clear of the runway, and he did. The commuter pilot acknowledged the other pilot's clear of runway transmission, and initiated the approach.  As the pilot descended through 150 feet above ground level, she noticed that the airplane that she had communicated with was not clear of the runway. The airplane on the ground was near the runway 23 numbers with the propeller turning, facing toward her landing airplane. She aborted the landing but the airplane did not climb. The airplane impacted the runway hard and bounced. She reported that when the airplane touched down after the bounce, she ""applied left rudder pedal to steer the aircraft off the runway and out of the way of the other aircraft's possible flight path."" The airplane exited the left side of the runway and ground-looped to the left. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right side of the fuselage and the right wing.  After the ground-loop, the pilot of the airplane near the runway 23 numbers attempted to takeoff. He was contacted via radio transmission by the airport manager and vehemently told that the runway was closed until further notice.

The aircraft was on a scheduled passenger flight from Perth Airport and had two flight crew, five cabin crew, and 177 passengers on board. The first officer was the Pilot Flying (PF) and the Captain was performing the role of the Pilot Monitoring (PM). Air traffic control (ATC) cleared the flight to descend and advised its flight crew to expect an arrival on runway 17. The controller also requested that the crew maintain maximum speed. In response, a descent speed of 320 kt was selected, 40 kt above the standard descent speed of 280 kt. The aircraftâs maximum allowable operating speed (VMO) was 340 kt. At about 22:00, the flight crew informed ATC that descent from flight level (FL) 310 had commenced and reported some light to moderate turbulence. Shortly after, ATC informed the flight crew that there would be a runway change to 35. At about 22:04, the flight was descending past FL 280 when the flight crew made an announcement over the aircraftâs public address system advising the cabin crew to prepare for landing. That announcement provided a cue to the cabin crew that they had about 10 minutes to secure all loose items in the cabin before illumination of the âfasten seat beltâ sign. By the time the aircraft passed FL 270, it had accelerated to the flight crew selected speed of 320 kt. At about 22:09, the turbulence began to increase. In response, the flight crew switched on the âfasten seat beltâ sign and advised the passengers and crew to be seated with seat belts fastened. The operatorâs procedures required cabin crew members to be seated within 1 minute of that announcement. At that time, a cabin crew member was passing row 22 on her way back to the rear of the cabin. The aircraftâs movement due to the turbulence was such that she needed to hold onto the overhead lockers as she walked along the aisle. About 15 seconds later, she reached the rear galley, closed a stowage latch, and secured a rubbish bin in preparation to be seated in the left cabin crew seat. When the flight descended through FL 220 (about 30 seconds after the âfasten seat beltâ sign was switched on), the wind direction changed by about 80 degrees, resulting in a head wind increase from 15 kt to 32 kt. That in turn led to the airspeed increasing through 325 kt, and the PF applying control column backpressure to avoid exceeding VMO. About 1 second after the maximum control column force was applied, the autopilot disengaged and the G-Load4 peaked at 2.2 g. The pilot monitoring reported that they were checking the instrument approach, as a result of the change to runway 35, when they heard the autopilot disengage tone and saw the speed of the aircraft increasing toward VMO. The aircraftâs pitch angle changed by 3.87 degrees in 1 second, and its airspeed reached a maximum of 339.5 kt. The cabin crew member recalled that, while standing in the rear galley and preparing for arrival, she felt the cabin floor drop and then quickly come up. The force due to the aircraftâs movement resulted in the cabin crew member fracturing her leg. The cabin crew member seated in the right rear seat assisted the injured cabin crew member. The aircraft movement also resulted in a second cabin crew member in the forward galley falling forward and hitting her head on a trolley. She also received injuries to her knees, back and neck. The flight crew received an interphone call from the cabin reporting the leg fracture injury. The turbulence subsided and the flight crew turned off the âfasten seat beltâ sign and first aid was provided to the injured crew members. At about 22:11, the aircraftâs speed decreased and the flight crew re-engaged the autopilot. The flight crew alerted ATC to the turbulence and were informed that no other turbulence had been reported in the area. Due to her fractured leg, the injured crew member in the rear galley remained lying on the cabin floor for the landing. The aircraft landed at about 22:34, and paramedics met the aircraft to attend to the two injured cabin crew members. Both of them were transferred to a hospital for treatment. The cabin crew member injured in the rear galley was admitted to the hospital. The other crew member was treated and discharged without admission. The aircraft was not damaged and none of the other crew or any of the passengers were injured. Findings - The increase in headwind while VH-VZZ was making a routine high speed descent at 320 kt resulted in the airspeed increasing towards the aircraftâs maximum allowable speed. - The pilot flying applied a control column input to prevent an overspeed, which resulted in the autopilot unexpectedly disengaging. The consequent change of pitch and g-loading led to two cabin crew suffering injuries. - The aircraftâs autopilot had been modified such that, if sufficient control column back pressure was applied, the autopilot would disengage rather than revert to the Control Wheel Steering (CWS) mode. Autopilot disengagement resulted in larger elevator and pitch responses than those associated with reversion to CWS mode.

There were no injuries, but the aircraft sustained substantial damage. After approximately one hour and ten minutes of flight time, during the descent procedure, the no.2 propeller rpm suddenly increased. The crewmembers performed the procedures set out in the aircraft manuals and proceeded to their destination. The crew carried out an NDB approach to runway 09 at Coari-Urucu Airport in light rain conditions. After touchdown the right propeller did not assume the reverse pitch with the throttle in position below Ground Idle. The aircraft then yawed to the left and veered off the runway approximately 500 m after the touchdown point, traveling about 180 m through the grass. Contributing factors. - Attention Â a contributor. The lack of attention to the lighting of the Low Pitch lights contributed to the application of reverse in both engines, with only one of the lights on. Thus, this action contributed to the asymmetric reverse condition, which allowed the aircraft to exit the runway on the left. - Emotional state Â undetermined. The feeling of apprehension experienced by the crewmembers in relation to the length of the runway, associated with the condition of night operation and in the rain, may have affected their performance, so that, in an attempt to anticipate the engines entering the reverse regime, the standard landing procedures were not properly performed. - Aircraft maintenance Â undetermined. The series of discrepancies identified in the Microswitch Box, PN 11S76180650-10, SN 0199, indicating that the unit could have been opened in an unauthorized location, raised doubts about the quality standard of the services performed on the aircraft, which may have allowed an aircraft grounding condition fault that has affected several aircraft electrical components and caused the Np Cancel function to fail.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CENIPA Report number: A-053/CENIPA/2017 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 years and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates15-Mar-2024 19:49 ASN Updated [Source, Accident report, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

According to the Juba Airport general manager, the aircraft took off from Juba at 14:07, bound for Wau. He stated there were 44 passengers: 39 adults, one child and four infants along with five crew members. South Supreme Airlines said the plane had been carrying five crew members and 40 passengers. In some media the airline reported that 24 passengers disembarked the plane at its first stop in Aweil. That would have meant that the aircraft travelled over 770 km with an intermediate stop in about eighty minutes time.Sources: khaleejtimes.com  South Sudan: Plane Carrying 21 Crashes in Wau, Causing Some Injuries / Voice of America  South Sudan in Focus  https://www.scramble.nl/database/soviet/details/27_20845  Location  Images: photo (c) UNMISS; Wau Airport (WUU); 20 March 2017; (nc-nd) photo (c) UNMISS; Wau Airport (WUU); 20 March 2017; (nc-nd) photo (c) UNMISS; Wau Airport (WUU); 20 March 2017; (nc-nd) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates24-Mar-2024 17:18 zhr2005 Updated [Cn, Source, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The private pilot, and sole occupant, was fatally injured. The airplane was destroyed by the impact and post-impact fire. The flight originated from Cincinnati Airport, Ohio, about 18:12 hours local time, and was destined for Atlanta-Fulton County Airport, Georgia.  The flight was uneventful until the air traffic controller amended the flight plan, which required the pilot to manually enter the new routing information into the GPS. A few minutes later, the pilot told the controller that he was having problems with the GPS and asked for a direct route to his destination. The controller authorized the direct route and instructed the pilot to descend from 22,000 ft to 6,000 ft, during which time the sound of the autopilot disconnect was heard on the cockpit voice recorder. During the descent, the pilot told the controller that the airplane had a steering problem and was in the clouds. The pilot was instructed to descend the airplane to 4,100 ft, which was the minimum vectoring altitude. The airplane continued to descend, entered visual meteorological conditions, and then descended below the assigned altitude. The controller queried the pilot about the airplane's low altitude and instructed the pilot to maintain 4,100 ft. The pilot responded that he was unsure if he would be able to climb the airplane back to that altitude due to steering issues. The controller issued a low altitude warning and again advised the pilot to climb back to 4,100 ft. The pilot responded that the autopilot was working again and that he was able to climb the airplane to the assigned altitude. The controller then instructed the pilot to change to another radio frequency, but the pilot responded that he was still having a problem with the GPS. The pilot asked the controller to give him direct routing to the airport. A few minutes later, the pilot told the controller that he was barely able to keep the airplane straight and its wings level. The controller asked the pilot if he had the airport in sight, which he did not. The pilot then declared an emergency and expressed concerns related to identifying the landing runway. Afterward, radio contact between the controller and the pilot was lost. Shortly before the airplane impacted the ground, a witness saw the airplane make a complete 360Â° roll to the left, enter a steep 90Â° bank to the left, roll inverted, and enter a vertical nose-down dive. Another witness saw the airplane spiral to the ground. The airplane impacted the front lawn of a private residence, and a postcrash fire ensued.  The aircraft was a Sierra Eagle wing conversion of a Cessna 500 Citation I. This performance upgrade also allows single pilot operations. However, the NTSB found no record of the pilot receiving training for single-pilot operations in the accident airplane. Therefore it was unlikely that the pilot was properly certificated to act as a single-pilot. The pilot historically had difficulty flying the airplane without the aid of the autopilot. Given the pilot's previous experience with the GPS installed on the airplane, it is likely that during the accident flight the pilot became confused about how to operate the GPS and ultimately was unable to properly control of the airplane without the autopilot engaged. Probable cause: The pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed while manually flying the airplane, which resulted in the airplane exceeding its critical angle of attack and experiencing an aerodynamic stall. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's inability control the airplane without the aid of the autopilot.METAR: 22:53 UTC / 18:53 local time: KFTY 242253Z 16009KT 10SM SCT060 23/08 A3027 RMK AO2 SLP246 T02280083Weather at Fulton County Airport: wind 160Â° at 9 knots; scattered clouds at 6000 feet; Tempeture 23Â°C, Dew point: 8Â°C23:47 UTC / 19:47 local time: KRYY 242347Z 16008KT 10SM OVC055 21/09 A3028Weather at Cobb Country Airport: wind 160Â° at 8 knots; overcast at 5500 feet; Tempeture 21Â°C, Dew point: 9Â°C23:53 UTC / 19:53 local time: KFTY 242353Z 17006KT 10SM OVC060 22/09 A3028 RMK AO2 SLP250 T02220089 10233 20211 55006Weather at Fulton County Airport: wind 170Â° at 6 knots; overcast at 6000 feet; Tempeture 22Â°C, Dew point: 9Â°CAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA17FA135 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: 11alive  flightaware.com  NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Marietta, GA; March 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) Flightaware / Google Earth; Marietta, GA; 24 March 2017 photo (c) Alec Wilson; Fort Lauderdale-Executive Airport, FL (FXE/KFXE); 11 February 2017 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

After a normal flight, the aircraft started the approach in good weather conditions to runway 31 at Jauja Airport. That day, according to NOTAM CO510/17, maintenance work was being carried out on the runway and only the right side was available.  The landing at the Jauja Airport was made by the First Officer, who was in the qualification stage to operate to high altitude airports. After the contact of the main landing gears and two seconds after the nose gear had touched down, almost simultaneously with the activation of the reverse, the crew felt strong vibrations and oscillations accompanied by pitching up and down. The aircraft bouncing a couple of times in an uncontrolled way and after a loud noise, the right main landing gear collapsed. The crew was unable to maintain directional control of the aircraft because the wheels of the left main landing gear and engine No. 2 moved off the runway on the right side. The engine entered a drainage channel and separated. A fuel spill that ignited, reaching the aircraft that had already stopped.  The pilot simultaneously activated the three ""Engine Fire"" switches and ordered the evacuation of the aircraft from the left side. He ordered the co-pilot to leave the cockpit, as a large amount of smoke was entering. The crew proceeded with the emergency evacuation. No injuries were recorded among the occupants, but the aircraft was de	stroyed as a result of the fire. CAUSE (translated from Spanish) Failure of the mechanical components of the 'SHIMMY DAMPER - SD"" system in each of the main landing gears of the B737-3M8 aircraft, registration number OB2036P, which, being out of tolerance range, did not allow the correct damping of the vibrations and lateral oscillations of the wheels, generating sequential 'SHIMMY"" events in both gears, which resulted in their collapse and breakage, while landing at Francisco CarlÃ© de Jauja Airport CONTRIBUTING FACTORS 1) Incorrect and probable absence of measurements on mechanical components of the ""CIMATIC CHAIN FOR SD OPERATION"", as indicated by the operator's PM AMM Task, which would have allowed for the timely detection and replacement of out-of-tolerance components, ensuring their integrity and correct operation. 2) The Service Letter 737-SL-32-057-E ""BROKEN TORSION LINK"", does not provide for mandatory actions, it only recommends maintenance practices to prevent fractures in mechanical components of the ""CIMMETIC CHAIN FOR SD OPERATION"". 3) Service Letter 737-SL-32-057-E ""FRACTURES in LOWER Torsion Link"", makes a proper interpretation difficult; that could induce errors to choose the corresponding AMM Task and determine its scope.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIAA Report number: CIAA-ACCID-005-2017 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: CORPAC  El Comercio  portaldeturismo.pe   Location  Images: photo (c) AAIB; 28 March 2017 photo (c) Aeroprints.com; Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KUL/WMKK); 02 December 2004 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft originated from Leeds/Bradford Airport, U.K. at 08:13 UTC (09:13 LT). The crew consisted of the line supervising captain, the copilot and a line training captain, sitting in the observation seat, to evaluate the copilot for his completion of line training. The copilot was the aircraft's pilot flying (PF) during the whole route. The flight went smoothly and the crew carried out the final ILS Z approach manoeuvre for runway 10 at the Alicante-Elche Airport maintaining stabilized approach parameters as described in the operator's manual. Nine seconds after starting the landing flare manoeuvre, touchdown was made with a pitch attitude of 5Â°, a calibrated speed of 119 kt and a vertical descent speed of 240 fpm. There was a vertical acceleration of 1.45 G corresponding to a firm impact. The flare manoeuvre was considered slow, which the manufacturer identifies as a risk factor for tail strike. The position of the control column was slackened slightly after touchdown was made, but the pitch attitude tendency continued to increase until it reached a value of 10.2Â°, reaching a 1.14 G vertical acceleration value. This attitude was maintained for one second, causing the rear of the aircraft to strike the runway surface. After the tail area had struck the runway, the captain took control of the aircraft and continued the landing manoeuvre, completing it without any additional problems. The flight crew were unaware that the aircraft's tail area had touched the runway until they were informed at the parking area by one of the cabin crew that they had heard an unusual noise when landing. The aircraft suffered damage to the lower part of the tail cone. All the people on board disembarked normally without any medical attention being required. Causes / Contributing factors: The investigation has determined that the cause of the accident was incorrect pitch position control during landing. As a contributing factor, the fact that the aircraft captain (PM) could have intervened before the accident to correct the situation is highlighted.METAR: 10:00 UTC / 12:00 local time: LEAL 101000Z 09006KT 050V150 9999 FEW020 18/10 Q1026 NOSIG11:00 UTC / 13:00 local time: LEAL 101100Z 09006KT 050V150 9999 FEW020 18/10 Q1026 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIAIAC Report number: A-003/2017 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: CIAIAC   Location  Images: photo (c) Leslie Snelleman; Palma de Mallorca Airport (PMI/LEPA); 30 August 2015 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Mozart Airport (SZG/LOWS)","Bangor International Airport, ME (BGR/KBGR)"," UUS Austria","Accident investigation report completed and information captured","The Gulfstream G450 took off from Salzburg Airport, Austria, at 10:12, bound for Bangor International Airport, Maine, USA.  A few seconds after taking off from runway 33, the landing gear lever was selected to the Up position. About 20 seconds later, the crew discovered that the landing gear had not retracted. The landing gear remained in the Down & Locked position because the landing gear safety pins were set. The crew suspected that the safety pins were still set and decided to land back at Salzburg Airport, which was carried out on runway 15. After a flight time of about 5 minutes, the aircraft left the runway at about 10:17 on taxiway E. They were instructed by the control tower to taxi back to the parking area (apron).  The aircraft was stopped shortly after taxiing on taxiway E, as the crew noticed an increased rolling resistance of the aircraft, whereby the crew suspected a burst tyre. The crew decided to check directly at the taxiway whether the safety pins were still on the landing gear, to remove them if necessary and to check whether a tire was defective. The control tower of Salzburg Airport was not informed about this by the pilots. The co-pilot opened the cabin door and left the aircraft to perform these checks. Meanwhile, the pilot left the cockpit to inform the passengers in the cabin of the situation. At 10:20 and 10:22, the Salzburg Tower controller tried without success to make contact with the aircraft's crew. An aircraft passing taxiway L informed the controller about a person on the taxiway who had left the aircraft in question. The co-pilot, who had gone to the landing gear, recognized that the safety pins were installed and tried to remove them. When this attempt failed because hydraulic pressure was applied to the landing gear cylinder and the safety pin was jammed, he operated the landing gear door control valves of the nose and main landing gear several times and installed the landing gear doors control valve pins. This closed the landing gear doors, the main cylinders of the hydraulics of the main and nose landing gear were depressurized and the safety pins could be removed. After the co-pilot removed the nose landing gear door pin, the nose landing gear doors opened and the nose landing gear folded at about 10:30. The aircraft nose lowered and hit the taxiway. 5 to 10 seconds later the engines were switched off. No indication could be found that both the Landing Gear Failure to Retract and the Attempted Landing Gear Retraction with Safety Pins Installed Checklist were executed from the time the installed Safety Pins were detected until the time of the accident. Probable causes - Incomplete execution of the Preflight Checklist, thus forgetting the safety pins installed in the landing gears. - No knowledge or execution of the checklists for Landing Gear Failure to Retract or the Attempted Landing Gear Retraction with Safety Pins Installed. Thus, incorrect operation of the landing gear system and, as a result, failure to properly reset the landing gear to a defined system state. Probable Factors - Lack of ""REMOVE BEFORE FLIGHT"" flags on landing gear safety pins. Consequently, more difficult to detect deployed fuse pins.  - Collusion between pilots on the insertion or non-insertion of the securing pins, although insertion is mandatory by the manufacturer for parking and towing. - Very extensive Exterior Preflight Inspection Checklist for daily flight operations with 136 inspection points, which tempts to simplify the checklist for daily operations to a few important inspection points, which is not permissible from a safety, operational and certification point of view. - Gradual increase in psychological stress, characterized by communication difficulties, lack of knowledge of systems and procedures, time pressure and psychophysiological stress. - Breaking the logic of landing gear system operation for pilots because despite 3 green downlock indicators and landing gear lever in DOWN position on a GIV-X (G450), the landing gear can retract on the ground due to incorrect and improper operation of the landing gear system. The selector valve of the landing gear thus remained in a position not directly visible to the pilots.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: UUS Austria Report number: BMVIT-85.245 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) Rudolf Schider; Salzburg-W.

Correia International Airport for Mahdia Airstrip. The aircraft was programmed to do a series of shuttles to various airstrips in the Region 8 area. The accident flight was the second shuttle between Mahdia and Kopinang. The previous flight was normal. For the second shuttle, the aircraft was loaded with one passenger and cargo for a flight to Kopinang Airstrip. The aircraft departed Mahdia at 11:12 hrs local time with an estimated flying time of 24 minutes. As the aircraft approached Kopinang, rain was observed over the airstrip. This caused the pilot to hold for about 10-15 minutes East of the field to allow the rain to pass. The aircraft landed, but during the landing roll the wheels locked up. The brakes were modulated, and the flaps were raised but the aircraft did not stop. The pilot then moved the mixture controls to shutoff and steered the aircraft left towards a playfield. This was occupied and he turned the aircraft right, into a construction site that was located off the end of the usable portion of the runway. The aircraft stopped in the construction area. The right hand main landing gear broke off and the nose landing gear was bent. Cause: This accident was caused because the aircraft could not be stopped, after landing, within the usable portion of the runway. Contributory Factors: 1. The decision to land, without making a proper assessment of the runway conditions. 2. The wetness of the runway, which prevented effective braking.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: GCAA-AIT Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: demerarawaves.com  stabroeknews.com History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  29 January 2015 8R-GAR Air Services Limited 0 Kurupung Airport, Region 7 min Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

On board the aircraft was one pilot, 1,225 kg of general cargo and 800 lbs of fuel. At 11:44 hours local time, in daylight conditions, the aircraft departed Tanahmerah and cruised at altitude of 7,000 feet. Estimate time arrival at Oksibil would be 12:24. At 12:12, when the aircraft position was about 45 NM north of Tanahmerah, the aircraft passed another Cessna 208B aircraft from the opposite direction from Oksibil to Tanahmerah. The Cessna 208B pilot advised to the pilot via radio that the PK-FSO aircraft was in sight. The pilot responded that the aircraft was maintaining 7,000 feet on direct route to Oksibil. The pilot failed to contact the Oksibil air traffic controller and failed to arrive at the destination. The airline's flight following officer received an emergency signal with a last recorded position of 6 NM north of Oksibil.  The next day the aircraft was found on a ridge of Anem Mountain at a height of 7100 feet. The aircraft was destroyed by impact forces and the pilot was fatally injured. The investigation learned that two days prior the occurrence, the pilot travelled on a night commercial flight. This might have resulted in a sleep disturbance during the window of circadian low and an increase of the potential of fatigue. There are indications that the pilot did not have the required adequate restorative sleep before he started flying on the accident day. Prior to the occurrence flight, the pilot had flown for 3 flight sectors, with total flight hour of 2 hours 55 minutes. The multiple take-offs and landings that day increased fatigue.  Based on the final flight track, the absence of voice communication, the weather condition permitting the pilot to identify the airport location and the aircraft wreckage, consistently indicated that there were no pilot activities to fly the aircraft after the last known pilot activities at about 29 Nm from Oksibil until impact. Colleagues of the pilot reported that he often smoked in the cockpit during the flight, looked sleepy and engaged the Terrain Inhibit switch which disabled the GA-EGPWS function while flying. This prevented any prior warning when the aircraft neared Anem Mountain. This known behavior was not reported to the Operation and Safety department, so no action could be taken. Contributing Factors: ""The possibility of the pilot being fatigue, physical and environment condition increased pilot sleepiness which might have made the pilot inadvertently falling asleep indicated by no pilot activity. The absence of GA-EGPWS aural alert and warning was unable to wake up the pilot.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSC Report number: KNKT.17.04.10.04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) NTSC; 13 km N of Oksibil Airport (OKL); April 2017 photo (c) Google Earth; 13 km N of Oksibil Airport (OKL); 12 April 2017 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight was cleared for approach and landing on runway 13.  In the final approach and landing phase moderate wind shear and moderate turbulence were encountered. The left crosswind and the tail wind encountered did not exceed the limits of the aircraft. After touchdown the aircraft veered off the left side of the runway and hit a barrier on one side of the runway nose-first, damaging its nose, left engine and wing. Findings related to probable causes: 1. The occurrence aircraft performed the final approach in left crosswind and landed with its nose yawing to the left. It was probably  affected by the clockwise horizontal wind shear on the runway and pilot's operation, the aircraft began drifting to the left after touching down. 2. As the aircraft was drifting to the left, the Captain had used right rudder to correct the deviation, and also pulled the power levers into the reverse range. According to the recorded engine data of torque and (reverse) power of both engines, it revealed that the Captain inadvertently pulled back the left power lever while he was intending to apply the right-turning differential power to assist him in correcting the left drift. It resulted in increasing the left reverse power and intensified the aircraftÂs left drifting tendency. 3. Though the Captain attempted to get the directional control of aircraft by increasing the right rudder input and the right wheel brake pressure, however he still kept increasing the reverse power of left engine to the maximum, not knowing that he was taking the wrong side. Consequently, the aircraft veered off the runway, hit the fence and caused aircraft substantial damage.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ASC Report number: ASC-AOR-18-03-002 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Focus Taiwan  ASC   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft came to rest with the nose contacting the runway surface.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: INIPAT Angola Report number: 03/INIPAT/22 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates09-Jul-2024 12:19 ASN Updated [Source, Category, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane was being operated as Flight 341 by Grant Aviation as a scheduled commuter flight. The pilot, the sole occupant, sustained fatal injuries. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the airplane's point of departure. Flight 341 departed Port Heiden Airport, Alaska, at 13:05, destined for Perryville Airport, Perryville, Alaska. Flight 341 originated at the King Salmon Airport, Alaska, with one passenger who disembarked at the Port Heiden Airport. The scheduled flight continued to the Perryville Airport, which was about 80 miles away, with 1,322 lbs. of mail and no passengers.  After an ELT signal of the aircraft was received, a search mission was initiated. At 17:30, the wreckage was located. The wreckage came to rest in deep snow at about 2,993 feet on the west face of a treeless, steep mountain in the Alaska Peninsula National Wildlife Refuge of the Aleutian Range. It is located about 500 feet from the top of the mountain ridge and partially submerged in the snow on its left side with the nose section under the snow pack. The fragmented wreckage was contained in an area of about 100 feet by 40 feet, on a heading of about 030 Â° magnetic, with the right wing separated and located about 40 feet forward of the main wreckage. The wings and fuselage sustained substantial damage.  At 12:39, an aviation special weather report (SPECI) from the Chignik Airport (the closest weather reporting facility) reported, in part: wind variable at 4 knots; visibility 10 statute miles, light rain; sky condition, overcast at 1,700 feet; temperature 39 Â° F, dewpoint 36 Â° F; altimeter, 29.51 inHg.

The flight was a regularly scheduled flight from Boston Logan Airport (BOS), Boston, Massachusetts, to the John F Kennedy International Airport (JFK), New York, New York.  There were no other injuries, and no damage to the airplane.  According to the flight attendant statements, the #3 flight attendant (FA) stated that because the ride was ""slightly bumpy,"" she remained seated for an additional 5 to 10 minutes after the cabin received the double chime indicating that the flight had passed 10,000 feet.  Once it seemed to have smoothed out, she stood up and began to prepare for cabin service. Shortly after standing up, the airplane shook violently and she was tossed off her feet and into the air and landed on her right ankle, ending up on the galley floor.  According to the flight crew statements, they had just completed a flight into BOS on a different airplane with nothing more than light turbulence on descent. Prior to the accident flight, the captain briefed the #1 FA that they had just flown in and didn't expect anything worse than light turbulence during climb out.  During climb out, the flight crew indicted they were in and out of the clouds and only experience light chop. The weather radar was on but ""was not painting anything."" Just prior to leveling off at 14,000 feet they encountered a strong jolt of turbulence and then received a call from the cabin about the #3 flight attendant injury. At the time of the turbulence, the fasten seatbelt sign was illuminated. The injured FA was assisted into a rear customer seat for the remainder of the flight with her foot elevated and ice applied. Because the injured FA was incapacitated, the #2 FA crewed the #3 FA position and a nonrevenue FA crewed the #2 FA position. The flight was met by emergency medical personnel and the FA was transported to a local hospital where she was diagnosed with a broken right ankle. Probable Cause: an inadvertent encounter with convective turbulence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA17CA111 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates15-Mar-2018 20:12 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

Both crew members suffered fatal injuries. The aircraft originated from Louisville International Airport, Kentucky at 05:41 hours.  As the flight neared Yeager Airport at an altitude of 9000 ft, the crew received the most recent ATIS report for the airport indicating wind from 080Â° at 11 knots, 10 miles visibility, scattered clouds at 700 ft agl, and a broken ceiling at 1300 ft agl. However, a special weather observation recorded about 7 minutes before the flight crew's initial contact with the approach controller indicated that the wind conditions had changed to 170Â° at 4 knots and that cloud ceilings had dropped to 500 ft agl. The approach controller did not provide the updated weather information to the flight crew and did not update the ATIS. The approach controller advised the flight crew to expect the localizer 5 approach, which would have provided a straight-in final approach course aligned with runway 5. The first officer acknowledged the instruction but requested the VOR-A circling instrument approach, presumably because the approach procedure happened to line up with the flight crew's inbound flightpath and flying the localizer 5 approach would result in a slightly longer flight to the airport.  However, because the localizer 5 approach was available, the flight crew's decision to fly the VOR-A circling approach was contrary to the operator's standard operating procedures (SOP). The minimum descent altitude (MDA) for the localizer approach was 373 ft agl, and the MDA for the VOR-A approach was about 773 ft agl. With the special weather observation indicating cloud cover at 500 ft agl, it would be difficult for the pilots to see the airport while at the MDA for the VOR-A approach; yet, the flight crew did not have that information. The approach controller was required to provide the flight crew with the special weather report indicating that the ceiling at the arrival airport had dropped below the MDA, which could have prompted the pilots to use the localizer approach; however, the pilots would not have been required to because the minimum visibility for the VOR-A approach was within acceptable limits. The approach controller approved the first officer's request then cleared the flight direct to the first waypoint of the VOR-A approach and to descend to 4000 ft. Radar data indicated that as the flight progressed along the VOR-A approach course, the airplane descended 120 feet below the prescribed minimum stepdown altitude of 1720 ft two miles prior to FOGAG waypoint. The airplane remained level at or about 1600 ft until about 0.5 mile from the displaced threshold of the landing runway. At this point, the airplane entered a 2500 ft-per-minute, turning descent toward the runway in a steep left bank up to 42Â° in an apparent attempt to line up with the runway. Performance analysis indicates that, just before the airplane impacted the runway, the descent rate decreased to about 600 fpm and pitch began to move in a nose-up direction, suggesting that the captain was pulling up as the airplane neared the pavement; however, it was too late to save the approach.  At 06:50, the airplane impacted the runway 5 centerline in a 22Â° left bank and 5Â° nose-down at an airspeed of about 92 knots. The airplane's left wingtip struck the pavement first, followed by the left main landing gear and left propeller. The fuselage impacted the pavement and the left wing separated from the airplane during the impact sequence. The airplane slid off the left side of the runway through the grass safety area and down a hill through trees, coming to rest about 380 feet left of the runway centerline and 85 ft below the runway elevation. Video and witness information were not conclusive as to whether the captain descended below the MDA before exiting the cloud cover; however, the descent from the MDA was not in accordance with federal regulations, which required, in part, that pilots not leave the MDA until the ""aircraft is continuously in a position from which a descent to a landing on the intended runway can be made at a normal descent rate using normal maneuvers."" The accident airplane's descent rate was not in accordance with company guidance, which stated that ""a constant rate of descent of about 500 ft./min. should be maintained."" Rather than continue the VOR-A approach with an excessive descent rate and airplane maneuvering, the captain should have conducted a missed approach and executed the localizer 5 approach procedure. No evidence was found to indicate why the captain chose to continue the approach; however, the captain's recent performance history, including an unsatisfactory checkride due to poor instrument flying, indicated that his instrument flight skills were marginal. It is possible that the captain felt more confident in his ability to perform an unstable approach to the runway compared to conducting the circling approach to land. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The flight crew's improper decision to conduct a circling approach contrary to the operator's standard operating procedures (SOP) and the captain's excessive descent rate and maneuvering during the approach, which led to inadvertent, uncontrolled contact with the ground. Contributing to the accident was the operator's lack of a formal safety and oversight program to assess hazards and compliance with SOPs and to monitor pilots with previous performance issues.""METAR: 10:30 UTC / 06:30 local time: KCRW 051030Z 17004KT 10SM FEW001 OVC005 14/13 A2940 RMK AO2 VLY FG T01390133 $10:54 UTC / 06:54 local time: KCRW 051054Z 23003KT 10SM FEW001 OVC005 14/13 A2941 RMK AO2 SLP952 VLY FG T0144013310:59 UTC / 06:59 local time: KCRW 051059Z COR 00000KT 10SM FEW001 OVC005 14/13 A2940 RMK AO2 VLY FG T01440133Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA17FA109 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: tristateupdate.com  flightaware.com   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Charleston-Yeager Airport, WV (CRW); 06 May 2017; (CC:by-nc-sa) photo (c) NTSB; Charleston-Yeager Airport, WV (CRW); 06 May 2017; (CC:by-nc-sa) photo (c) NTSB; Charleston-Yeager Airport, WV (CRW); 06 May 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Charleston-Yeager Airport, WV (CRW); 06 May 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Charleston-Yeager Airport, WV (CRW); 06 May 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Charleston-Yeager Airport, WV (CRW); May 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Charleston-Yeager Airport, WV (CRW); May 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Charleston-Yeager Airport, WV (CRW); May 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Charleston-Yeager Airport, WV (CRW); 05 May 2017 photo (c) NTSB; Charleston-Yeager Airport, WV (CRW); 05 May 2017 photo (c) NTSB; Charleston-Yeager Airport, WV (CRW); 05 May 2017 photo (c) Leslie Snelleman; East Midlands Airport (EMA/EGNX); 17 April 1983 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Both crew members suffered fatal injuries. The flight departed from the Philadelphia International Airport, Pennsylvania, about 15:04 on a repositioning flight destined for Teterboro (TEB). The crew filed a flight plan for the accident flight that included altitude (27,000 ft) and time en route (28 minutes) entries that were incompatible with each other, which suggests that the crew devoted little attention to preflight planning. The crew also had limited time in flight to plan and brief the approach, as required by company policy, and did not conduct an approach briefing before attempting to land at TEB. Cockpit voice recorder data indicated that the  second-in-command (SIC) was the pilot flying (PF) from PHL to TEB, despite a company policy prohibiting the SIC from acting as PF based on his level of experience. Although the accident flight was likely not the first time that the SIC acted as PF, based on comments made during the flight. The PIC regularly coached the SIC from before takeoff to the final seconds of the flight. The extensive coaching likely distracted the PIC from his duties as PIC and pilot monitoring, such as executing checklists and entering approach waypoints into the flight management system. Collectively, procedural deviations and errors resulted in the flight crewÂs lack of situational awareness throughout the flight and approach to TEB. Because neither pilot realized that the airplaneÂs navigation equipment had not been properly set for the instrument approach clearance that the flight crew received, the crew improperly executed the vertical profile of the approach, crossing an intermediate fix and the final approach fix hundreds of feet above the altitudes specified by the approach procedure. The controller had vectored the flight for the instrument landing system runway 6 approach, circle to runway 1. When the crew initiated the circle-to-land maneuver, the airplane was 2.8 nautical miles (nm) beyond the final approach fix (about 1 mile from the runway 6 threshold) and could not be maneuvered to line up with the landing runway, which should have prompted the crew to execute a go-around because the flight did not meet the companyÂs stabilized approach criteria. However, neither pilot called for a go-around. The PIC, who had assumed control of the airplane at this point in the flight, continued the approach by initiating a turn to align with the landing runway. Radar data indicated that the airplaneÂs airspeed was below the approach speed required by company standard operating procedures (SOP). During the turn, the airplane stalled and impacted the ground in a right wing low and nose down attitude in an industrial area between Kero Road and Commerce Road in Carlstadt, New Jersey, 1000 m short of runway 01. A fire erupted and consumed the aircraft. Both crew members died in the accident. Probable Cause: ""The NTSB determines that the probable cause of this accident was the PICÂs attempt to salvage an unstabilized visual approach, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall at low altitude. Contributing to the accident was the PICÂs decision to allow an unapproved SIC to act as PF, the PICÂs inadequate and incomplete preflight planning, and the flight crewÂs lack of an approach briefing. Also contributing to the accident were Trans-PacificÂs lack of safety programs that would have enabled the company to identify and correct patterns of poor performance and procedural noncompliance and the FAAÂs ineffective SAS procedures, which failed to identify these company oversight deficiencies.""METAR: 14:52 UTC / 18:52 local time: KTEB 151852Z 35020G30KT 10SM SCT045 19/06 A297515:45 UTC / 19:45 local time: KTEB 151945Z 32015G32KT 10SM SCT045 19/04 A2975 RMK SMOKE ON APCHAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NTSB/AAR-19/02 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Flightaware  NBC  FAA  NorthJersey.com  Teterboro Learjet Crash Raises Questions about Crew Qualifications (Flying.com, 13 Feb 2018)   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Teterboro Airport, NJ (TEB); 15 May 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Teterboro Airport, NJ (TEB); 15 May 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) Google Earth, with ASN annotations; Teterboro Airport, NJ (TEB); 15 May 2017 photo (c) NTSB; Teterboro Airport, NJ (TEB); 15 May 2017 photo (c) NTSB; Teterboro Airport, NJ (TEB); 15 May 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) Paul Kanagie; Philadelphia International Airport, PA (PHL/KPHL); 15 May 2017 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Of the 146 passengers and crew onboard, one flight attendant received serious injuries.Â  The airplane was notÂ damaged.Â The regularly scheduled passenger flight was operating under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 from Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport (KMSY), New Orleans, Louisiana, to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (KDFW), Dallas, Texas. During cruise, as the flight was approaching a line of weather, the flight crew made a public address announcement for the passengers to be seated because they expected turbulence.Â  In addition, the captain called the lead flight attendant (FA) and instructed that all the flight attendants be seated. The seatbelt sign was illuminated for the entire flight. About 10 minutes later, the flight penetrated a line of weather and the airplane had a short encounter with moderate turbulence. The autopilot did not disengage during the encounter. When the turbulence occurred, one of the FAs was seated inÂ the aft galley without her seatbelt fastened and was thrownÂ upwards, hitting her head on the ceiling before landing on the galley floor. She was assisted by medically qualified passengers and remained on the floor for the remainder of the flight due to numbness in her extremities.  Emergency personnel met the airplane after landing and the injured FA was transported to the hospital where she was diagnosed with number 1 lumbar fracture.

The aircraft originated from the Conrad Maldives Rangali Island Resort at 08:08 hours local time. The co-pilot was Pilot Flying. The flight and approach to MalÃ© were uneventful. While landing the left float touched the water first, then the aircraft bounced and ballooned. It then landed on the left float for a second time, and bounced again. Then the aircraft was banking excessively to the right digging the right wing tip in the water, making the aircraft veer to the right. Then the aircraft crashed on water banking to the left with the left float digging into the water. After the accident the aircraft came to rest with the left hand wing touching the water with an apparently collapsed left hand float attachment. Causes: a. Improper recovery techniques from a bounced landing; application of go-around procedures whilst the aircraft was at low speed with flaps fully extended. b. Breakdown of crew coordination during the attempted go-around.METAR: 03:00 UTC / 08:00 local time: VRMM 280300Z 24014KT 9999 SCT018 BKN270 29/25 Q1010 NOSIG04:00 UTC / 09:00 local time: VRMM 280400Z 24014KT 9999 SCT018 BKN270 30/26 Q1010 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: AICC Maldives Report number: jan-17 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Sun.mv  raajje.mv   Location  Images: photo (c) Flightradar24; MalÃ©-Velana International Airport (MLE); 27 May 2017 photo (c) Leslie Snelleman; MalÃ© International Airport (MLE/VRMM); 10 January 2016 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft operated on a cargo charter flight with 1680 kg cargo on board. It took off from Kathmandu at 07:44 UTC at flight 409, bound for Lukla. It was the 5th flight of the aircraft to Lukla and with the same set of crew. Lukla weather was cloudy, but visibility and ceiling was reported to be fine after an hour of heavy rain. On first contact flight 409 reported abeam Rumjatar descending out of 11300 ft at 08:10 UTC. Lukla Tower provided the latest weather at the airport, as well as enroute weather relayed by 9N-AGU, an AS350 helicopter that had departed Lukla for Kathmandu. Almost 4 minutes after the first contact, Tower informed flight 409 about the deteriorating weather. The right base leg was covered by lifting fog though there was no rain and the final approach area was still visible. Weather deteriorated further and Tower regularly updated the flight crew. About 30 seconds after flight 409 reported entering valley, Lukla Tower again informed about the latest status of the further deteriorating weather. Flight 409 then informed that they would come up to Bhatkeko Daada and then decide. The pilot also informed they could see some bright spots. While continuing approach, both cockpit crew sighted the runway at 9100 ft. That was 64 seconds before the impact. While continuing approach the aircraft deviated to the right by almost 15 degrees and erroneously descended too low to 8500 ft whereas threshold height is 8900 ft (on Kathmandu QNH, whereas per AIP it is 9200 ft).  The flight crew attempted to climb and reach the threshold in a landing configuration. The aircraft pitched up to over 25Â°, the airspeed dropped and the aircraft stalled. Subsequently its left wing first hit a small tree and then impacted the sloping terrain 130 feet short of the runway. The captain and copilot both sustained fatal injuries. Probable Cause:  The Commission concludes that the probable cause of this accident was aircraft stall as a result of excessive drag created by sudden increase in angle of attack of the aircraft supplemented by low speed (below Vref) in an attempt to initiate immediate climb on a landing configuration (full flap and landing gear down) warranted by the critical situation of the final phase of flight. The contributing factors for the accident are: a. Critical terrain and rapidly deteriorating weather condition. b. Pilot's loss of situational awareness c. Improper pilot response to stall warning including failure to advance power lever to maximum at appropriate time. d. Voilation of SOP by the ATS and Pilot as well.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Nepal AAIC Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Kathmandu Post  Hemant Arjyal  My Republica  The Himalayan Times History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  2 June 2015 9N-AKY Goma Air 0 Pokhara Airport (VNPK), Pokhara, Kaski, Gandaki min Location  Images: photo (c) Eckhard SchlÃ¶der; Lukla-Tenzing-Hillary Airport (LUA); 04 January 2017 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

On this flight, the Second in Command (SIC) acted as Pilot Flying (PF) and the Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as Pilot Monitoring (PM). At 08:31, the pilot made first contact with the Rendani Tower controller and informed that the aircraft was descending from FL230 and requested weather information. The Rendani Tower controller informed the pilot that the wind was calm, ground visibility 6 km, cloud FEW CB 1,400 feet, temperature and dew point 26/25Â°C. At 08:36, Rendani Tower instructed to the pilot to descend to 11,000 feet and to report when on Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC). At 08:38, the pilot informed that they were in VMC and passing altitude 13,000 feet at 32 NM from the ZQ NDB (Non-Directional Beacon). The Rendani Tower controller instructed to fly overhead, descend to circuit altitude, join right downwind runway 35, and to report when overhead Manokwari. At 08:44, the pilot reported that the aircraft was over Manokwari and the Tower controller informed the pilot that the visibility had changed to 5 km. Two minutes later Rendani Tower instructed the pilot to continue approach and to report on right base runway 35. At 08:49, at approximately 600 feet, the PIC as PM took over control by called ""I have control"" and the SIC replied ""You have control"". A few seconds later the pilot reported that the aircraft was on final runway 35, and Rendani Tower instructed to the pilot to report when the runway 35 in sight. The pilot immediately replied that the runway was in sight, which was acknowledged by Rendani Tower who then issued landing clearance with additional information that the wind was calm and the runway condition wet. At approximately 550 feet, the PIC instructed the SIC turn on the wiper and reconfirmed to SIC that the runway was in sight. Between altitude 500 feet to 200 feet, the EGPWS aural warnings ""Sink Rate"" and ""Pull Up"" sounded. At 08:50, the aircraft touched down on runway 35. The spoilers deployed and the pilot activated the thrust reversers. The crew did not feel significant deceleration. The aircraft failed to stop on the runway and overran by approximately 20 meters from the end of runway pavement. After the aircraft stopped, the PIC commanded ""Evacuate"" through the Passenger Address (PA) system. The Rendani Tower Controller saw that the aircraft had overrun, activated the crash bell and then informed the Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) that there was an aircraft overrun after landing on runway 35. All the flight crew and passengers evacuated the aircraft and transported to the terminal building safely.

The ten occupants were not injured, but the aircraft was substantially damaged. The aircraft was on a sales trip to Mongolia at the time of the accident. Eight passengers were due to be taken on a flight out of Ulan Bator. The aircraft was fueled with 950 kg of fuel. Flaps were set at 20Â°, according to the crew, and the aircraft was cleared for takeoff from runway 32. After lifting off the runway, the aircraft went into an immediate climb and flaps were retracted at an altitude of 40-50 m. Shortly afterwards the aircraft pitched up and entered a right bank with increasing roll rate. The aircraft lost altitude and impacted terrain between the runway and the taxiway. The right main gear and lower and upper right wings impacted the ground first, causing the undercarriage and wings to collapse.  The TVS-2MS was an Antonov 2T that was converted in 2013 with a TPE331 turbine engine instead of the original Shvetzov ASH-62IR radial piston engine. Conclusion: The aircraft accident with UEMOB RA-2099G took place because of its entering the stall mode during takeoff with the values of weight and alignment exceeding the established limits.

The aircraft departed Saltillo Airport at 21:27 on a non-scheduled cargo flight to Puebla, Mexico, carrying a total of 550 kgs of cargo. The captain was Pilot Flying, the copilot was Pilot Monitoring. Prior to departure the flight was supposed to have been refueled with about 2000 lbs of fuel. However, the flight took off without having been refueled and with just 700 lbs of fuel in the tanks. At 22:27 hours the flight declared a fuel emergency to the Mexico City ACC controller. The crew decided to divert to Tampico.  Upon their request, the flight was cleared for an approach to runway 31. On final approach the aircraft hit trees and force landed, coming to rest about 850 meters from the runway threshold. The aircraft sustained substantial damage. Probable cause: ""Emergency landing due to an inadequate pre-flight of the aircraft which resulted in the loss of power of both engines during the cruise flight due to exhaustion of fuel on board"".

On touch down, the right hand main landing gear collapsed resulting from a collision with an obstacle of approximately 2 meter high on short final approach. The aircraft subsequently had a runway excursion to the starboard side. A segment of the right hand wing contacted the ground and was severed off from the rest of the wing with ensuing fuel spillage and fire. All the four propeller blades of the starboard engine contacted the ground surface and suffered rearwards bends. The fire was however contained before spreading further. The aircraft was operated by Safari Express Airways on behalf of the UN World Food Programme, according to the AAID Kenya.

During the landing rollout, the aircraft overshot the end of the runway, eventually hitting a rainwater drainage ditch located approximately 70 meters from the threshold. The aircraft had substantial damage. The two pilots and three passengers were unharmed. Contributing factors. - Application of commands - contributed. Flight controls were not adequately used to correct the variations presented during final to landing, leading to increased speed and long touchdown on the runway. - Cabin coordination - undetermined. It is possible that the aircraft weight for landing and Vref were not part of the descent/approach briefing as per the company's Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), having the potential to generate information conflicts on board the aircraft. - Airport infrastructure - contributed. The aircraft crashed into a masonry drainage ditch for rainwater located in the Runway End Safety Area (RESA). This area was supposed to be clean and level and provide safety for aircraft operating at the airfield if one of them touched down before reaching the headland or accidentally overshot the end of the runway. - Pilotage Judgment - contributed. It was considered that, despite being on a non-stabilized approach, a safe landing would be possible. Likewise, the distance required for landing in the conditions that presented themselves was not taken into consideration. - Perception - contributed. The landing in disagreement with the predicted parameters for a stabilized approach denoted a low level of crew situational awareness of factors that could affect the execution of the task and compromise flight safety. The night VFR flight in a mountainous area and with few light references on the ground may have contributed to a reduced perception of the final approach parameters. - Decision making - contributed. The landing, despite the non-stabilized approach and the possibility of a go-around, was based on an inadequate assessment of the existing conditions, contributing to the accident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CENIPA Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: CENIPA  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates15-Sep-2020 08:15 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

Three crew members and six passengers were on board the airplane. At 07:20 UTC the airplane reached cruise level FL340. After entering Indian airspace (Mumbai FIR) the aircraft was cleared to fly to reporting point KITAL via route L894. At approximately 08:18 UTC the co-pilot radioed reaching reporting point GOLEM. At 06:55 UTC an Airbus A380-861 (A6-EUL) had taken off at Dubai Airport, United Arab Emirates, for flight EK412 to Sydney, Australia. The aircraft flew at FL350 with a southern heading. At 08:38:07 UTC the A380 had passed the Challenger overhead with a vertical distance of 1,000 ft. At 08:38:54 UTC the Challenger, with engaged autopilot, began to slightly roll right. At the same time a counter-rotating aileron deflection was recorded and fluctuation of the vertical acceleration began.  In the subsequent approximately 10 seconds the airplane had a right bank angle of 4Â° to 6Â°. At 08:39:03 UTC the right bank angle began to increase. Within one second the bank angle increased to 42Â° to the right. At the same time the aileron deflection to the left increased to 20Â° and the vertical acceleration to 1.6 g. In the following second vertical acceleration changed to -3.2 g. At 08:39:04 UTC a lateral acceleration of 0.45 g to the right was recorded. The pitch angle changed from about 3Â° to about 1Â°, then within one second increased to 9Â° and decreased again in the following second to -20Â°. At the same time the FDR recorded a rudder deflection to the left reaching 11.2Â° after about two seconds whereas the bank angle changed from 42Â° right to 31Â° left. Between 08:39:05 UTC and 08:39:10 UTC Indicated Airspeed (in knots) changed from approximately 277 KIAS to 248 KIAS. The N1 of the left engine of 95% began to decrease. The lateral acceleration then reached 0.94 g left, the autopilot disengaged, and a master warning, lasting seven seconds, was recorded. Both pilots had actuated the aileron to the right in order to stop the rolling motion. But the airplane had continued to roll to the left thereby completing several rotations. Subsequently both Inertial Reference Systems (IRS), the Flight Management System (FMS), and the attitude indication failed. Between 08:39:09 UTC and 08:39:41 UTC the FDR recorded a loss of altitude of approximately 8,700 ft. Large control surface deflections and acceleration were recorded. The speed increased and at 08:39:31 UTC reached approximately 330 KIAS. At 08:39:30 UTC the spoilers extended and 13 seconds later were retracted again. The N1 of the left engine had decreased to approximately 40% when the Interstage Turbine Temperature (ITT) began to increase and nine seconds later had reached 850Â°. The left engine was shut off. At about 08:56 UTC the Pilot in Command (PIC) informed the air traffic controller in Mumbai of the occurrence, declared emergency, and reported their position, altitude and their intention to fly via KITAL to Oman. At about 09:15 UTC the crew restarted the left engine. Subsequently the airplane climbed to FL250. At about 09:56 UTC the autopilot was re-engaged. At 11:05 UTC the Challenger landed at Muscat Airport. The A380 continued the flight to Sydney and landed there at 19:58 UTC. The aircraft manufacturer determined that the Challenger's airframe structure could not be restored to an airworthy state as it exceeded the airframe certification design load limits during the upset encounter.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BFU Report number: BFU17-0024-2X Status: Preliminary reportDuration: 4 monthsDownload report:  Preliminary report Sources: Oman Observer  atheer.com  PPRuNe   Location  Images: photo (c) BFU/Google Earth; over Arabian Sea; 07 January 2017 photo (c) BFU; over Arabian Sea; 07 January 2017 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The crew had planned a shortest possible ground stop before flying to Torp Sandefjord Airport. The captain flew the aircraft (PF), while the First Officer monitored the flying (PM). During the ground stop at Gardermoen, only one engine was stopped while the First Officer completed an external inspection of the aircraft He did not observe any ice or anything out of the ordinary on the areas of the aircraft that could be inspected. There were icing conditions at Gardermoen and in the airspace above the airport. After flying from Switzerland for more than two hours in approximately minus 50Â°C, the aircraft's surfaces (fuselage and wings) were more than likely chilled. When the crew requested taxi clearance, they were assigned a different runway than expected. This entailed a longer taxi time and thus longer exposure to the prevailing weather conditions. The aircraft's ground stop lasted approximately 15 minutes at an air temperature of 0Â°C. The taxiways and runway were covered with 3-6 mm of slush and it was snowing when the aircraft took off. Initially, the take-off proceeded as normal. The landing gear was retracted and both pilots observed that the speed was rapidly approaching 200 kt, which is the maximum speed with flaps deployed. As the flaps were retracted, the crew experienced a violent nose-down movement and the pilots were ""hanging by their seat belts"", while the aircraft started sharply banking to the left. The aircraft at this moment experienced negative 2.62 G. The captain did not trust the instruments while the First Officer had better situational awareness. The First Officer quickly took control and started a pull-out from the dive. The aircraft descended below the cloud base, and even though it was dark, the pilots could glimpse the ground. Control was regained and the aircraft levelled off 170 ft above the ground. The aircraft was overstressed to 5.99 G during the pull-out. The crew called ""MAYDAY"" to the Air Traffic Control. Once control was regained, the ""MAYDAY"" was cancelled and the flight continued towards Torp where an approach and landing took place without further problems. The aircraft was overstressed well above Ultimate Load Factor (-2.16 to +5.40 G) and considered not to be economically viable to repair. Primary conclusion: 1. The probable explanation for the aircraft suddenly diving, is that the tailplane stalled. AIBN has not found other explanations for this than slush spray from the runway and falling snow and sleet settled on the tailplane's leading edge and underside during taxi and take-off. This contamination is presumed to have frozen to ice. 2. The aircraft's anti and de-icing systems on the wings and tailplane were switched on, but the tailplane de-icing system had completed a ""cycle"" before take-off and was in rest mode during take-off. In the assessment by AIBN, the aircraft's anti- and de-icing systems were not suitable to remove the type of ice and snow that had most likely settled on the aircraft's tailplane. The aircraft should have been de-iced before take-off, in line with the company's de-icing procedure, to avoid potential consequences of contamination on the tailplane. 3. This accident shows the significance of good crew resource management (CRM) in the cockpit when an unexpected and extreme flight situation occurs. In this instance, the First Officer's situational awareness and initial pull-out contributed to the aircraft not crashing.METAR: 15:20 UTC / 16:20 local time: ENGM 111520Z 03005KT 350V100 4200 -SN BR OVC004 00/M01 Q0965 TEMPO 2500 -SN BKN006=15:50 UTC / 16:50 local time: ENGM 111550Z 03005KT 010V070 6000 -SNRA OVC004 00/M00 Q0965 TEMPO 3000 -SN=16:20 UTC / 17:20 local time: ENGM 111620Z 02007KT 350V050 6000 -SN SCT004 BKN007 00/M01 Q0965 TEMPO 3000 -SN=16:50 UTC / 17:50 local time: ENGM 111650Z 36006KT 5000 -RA BR SCT002 BKN015 00/M01 Q0965 TEMPO 3000 -SNRA BR BKN008=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIBN Report number: SL 2020/03 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years Download report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) Flyger83; 21 November 2009 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All four crew members and 35 persons on the ground were killed. Flight 6491 departed Hong Kong on a cargo service to Istanbul, carrying a load of 85618 kgs. An en route refueling and crew change stop was planned at Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. Weather at Bishkek was poor with winds from 60Â°at 1 m/s and a visibility (RVR) of 400m at the beginning of the runway; 350m at the mid-point and 400m at the end of the runway. Vertical visibility was 50 m. Air temperature was -9Â°C, dew point -10Â°C, pressure (QNH) was 1023,9 hPa. The initial descent towards Bishkek was normal. The crew contacted Approach Control at 07:06 hours and were cleared for a descent to FL060 as per TOKPA 1 STAR (Standard terminal arrival route). The aircraft overflew the TOPKA reporting point at 07:11 at FL092 while in descent. According to the approach chart, FL060 or above should be reached when overflying TOKPA. Shortly afterwards the controller cleared the flight for an ILS approach to runway 26. At 07:12 the controller cleared the crew for further descent to altitude 3400 ft. The aircraft was meanwhile crossing FL074. The crew was busy monitoring the flight altitude and was aware they were higher than the STAR chart. The localizer was capture at 3600 ft agl. At that time the altitude should have been 1345 ft agl (3400 ft amsl). At 07:15:21 after the crew confirmed capturing the localizer, the flight was handed over to Tower Control. At a distance of 1.7 nm the aircraft reached 3400 ft amsl and the ALT HOLD OPER autopilot mode was engaged longitudinally. At that point the flight was already over 400 ft above the glideslope. The glideslope mode was armed (G/S MODE ARM), but the glideslope was not captured. At 07:15:31 while the aircraft was in level flight at 3400 ft amsl Outer Marker overflight was recorded (as per the approach chart Outer Marker overflight altitude is 2800 ft amsl).  A glideslope signal was captured at 07:15:52, at that time the aircraft was almost over VOR/DME MANAS at a distance of approximately 1.1 nm from the runway 26 threshold, at an angle of approximately 9Â°. However, as per the approach chart, the rated glideslope angle is 3Â°. The aircraft automatically initiated descent with a vertical speed of up to 1425 ft/min. Six seconds after the glideslope capture LAND 3 autoland status annunciation was recorded. The crew called out the annunciation. At 07:16:01 at 3300 ft amsl the aircraft crossed the Middle Marker (as per the approach chart MM overflight altitude is 2290 ft amsl). After the glideslope descent was initiated the glideslope pointer was fluctuating within - 4 to + 4 dots. At 07:16:07, at 3150 ft amsl, AP CAUTION and FMA FAULT 2 events were recorded. These events were continuously recorded almost until the end of the flight. An FMA FAULT 2 means that the autopilot can no longer track the actual glideslope, but will track a constant 3Â° glide path until a valid glideslope signal is regained or until the crew intervenes by disengaging the autopilot or initiating a go-around. As the aircraft was descending LAND 3 status degraded to LAND 2, which was confirmed by the crew callout. LAND 2 means that the autopilot flight director system redundancy is reduced to the use of only two of the three autopilots. The EGPWS 'Glideslope' alert was then triggered 5 times.  At 07:17:04 the flight crossed the runway 26 departure end at a height of about 110 ft. Decision height was 99 ft. The FO then called ""Minimums"" and the captain informed that there was no visual contact and called to go-around. At 58 ft radar altitude the TOGA switch was pushed and engine power increased. 3.5 seconds after the TOGA switch had been pushed the aircraft hit slightly upsloping terrain and obstacles. The ground speed at the time of impact was 165 kt. The maximum recorded vertical acceleration was 6 g. Initial impact occurred at a distance of approximately 930 m from the runway 26 departure end. It collided with a concrete airport fence and rolled into a holiday village. The aircraft broke up and spilt fuel caught fire. Conclusion: The cause of the Boeing 747-412F TC-MCL aircraft accident was the missing control of the crew over the aircraft position in relation to the glideslope during the automatic approach, conducted at night in the weather conditions, suitable for ICAO CAT II landing, and as a result, the measures to perform a go-around, not taken in due time with the aircraft, having a significant deviation from the established approach chart, which led to the controlled flight impact with terrain (CFIT) at the distance of Â930 m beyond the end of the active RWY. The contributing factors were, most probably, the following: - the insufficient pre-flight briefing of the flight crew members for the flight to Manas aerodrome (Bishkek), regarding the approach charts, as well as the non-optimal decisions taken by the crew when choosing the aircraft descent parameters, which led to the arrival at the established approach chart reference point at a considerably higher flight altitude; - the lack of the crew's effective measures to decrease the aircraft vertical position and its arrival at the established approach chart reference point while the crew members were aware of the actual aircraft position being higher than required by the established chart; - the lack of the requirements in the Tower controllers' job instructions to monitor for considerable aircraft position deviations from the established charts while the pertinent technical equipment for such monitoring was available; - the excessive psycho-emotional stress of the crew members caused by the complicated approach conditions (night time, CAT II landing, long-lasting working hours) and their failure to eliminate the flight altitude deviations during a long time period. Additionally, the stress level could have been increased due to the crew's (especially the PIC's) highly emotional discussion of the ATC controllers' instructions and actions. Moreover, the ATC controllers' instructions and actions were in compliance with the established operational procedures and charts; - the lack of the crew members' monitoring for crossing the established navigational reference points (the glideslope capture point, the LOM and LIM reporting points); - the crew's failure to conduct the standard operational procedure which calls for altitude verification at the FAF/FAP, which is stated in the FCOM and the airline's OM. On the other hand, the Jeppesen Route Manual, used by the crew, contains no FAF/FAP in the RWY 26 approach chart; - the onboard systems' ""capture"" of the false glideslope beam with the angle of Â9Â°; - the design features of the Boeing 747-400 aircraft type regarding the continuation of the aircraft approach descent in the automatic mode with the constant descent angle of 3Â° (the inertial path) with the maintained green indication of the armed automatic landing mode (regardless of the actual aircraft position in relation to the RWY) while the aircraft systems detected that the glideslope signal was missing (after the glideslope signal ""capture""). With that, the crew received the designed annunciation, including the aural and visual caution alerts; - the absence of the red warning alert for the flight crew in case of a ""false"" glideslope capture and the transition to the inertial mode trajectory, which would require immediate control actions from the part of the crew; - the lack of monitoring from the part of the crew over the aircraft position in regard to the approach chart, including the monitoring by means of the Navigation Display (ND), engaged in the MAP mode; - the crew's failure to conduct the Airline's Standard Operational Procedures (SOPs), regarding the performance of the go-around procedure in case the ""AUTOPILOT"" (the AP switching to the inertial mode) and ""GLIDESLOPE"" (the EGPWS annunciation of the significant glideslope deviation) alerts during the automatic CAT II landing at true heights below 1000 ft (with no visual reference established with either the runway environment or with the lighting system); - the delayed actions for initiating the go-aroundMETAR: 01:00 UTC / 07:00 local time: UCFM 160100Z VRB01MPS 0050 R26/0300N FZFG VV001 M09/M10 Q1023 R26/19//60 NOSIG01:30 UTC / 07:30 local time: UCFM 160130Z VRB01MPS 0150 R26/0550 FZFG VV001 M09/M10 Q1024 R26/19//60 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: Other false glideslope-related incidents History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  2 December 2011 9V-SFL Singapore Airlines Cargo 0 Singapore-Changi International Airport (SIN/WSSS) min Runway excursion Location  Images: photo (c) Nataev; Bishkek-Manas International Airport (FRU); 16 January 2017; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) MAK; Bishkek-Manas International Airport (FRU); January 2017 photo (c) MAK; Bishkek-Manas International Airport (FRU); January 2017 photo (c) MAK; Bishkek-Manas International Airport (FRU); January 2017 photo (c) MAK; Bishkek-Manas International Airport (FRU); 20 January 2017 photo (c) MAK; Bishkek-Manas International Airport (FRU); 20 January 2017 photo (c) MAK; 20 January 2017 photo (c) MAK; 20 January 2017 photo (c) Tomoaki Kongou; Hong Kong-Chek Lap Kok International Airport (HKG/VHHH); 11 September 2016; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) Kelvin Jahae; Maastricht/Aachen Airport (MST/EHBK); 11 January 2017; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) Claude Davet; Brussel-Zaventem Airport (BRU/EBBR) [OO]; 15 March 2008; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) Merijn Passchier; Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS/EHAM); 31 August 2005; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The cargo transport flight departed from Glendive-Dawson Community Airport, Montana about 09:45 with a planned destination of Sidney-Richland Municipal Airport, Montana.  The pilot reported that after departure, he retracted the landing gear and heard a ""thud"" sound. The landing gear ""unsafe"" light was illuminated and the left landing gear light remained illuminated green, an indication that it was still extended despite the landing gear handle being in the retracted position. When reaching his initial destination of Sidney, the pilot performed a low pass over the runway to enable maintenance personnel on the ground do a visual assessment. A mechanic stated that the nose gear was extended. The pilot diverted to Billings and the air traffic control personnel confirmed observing the nose gear extended at a 45-degree angle. The pilot further stated that he aligned with runway 28R and just prior to touch down, he feathered the propellers and decreased the airspeed. During touchdown, the right gear collapsed and the airplane came to rest on the centerline. As a result of the impact, the right aileron and right wing spar sustained damage.

The pilot and the passenger were fatally injured.  A witness observed the airplane takeoff from runway 11L and rapidly pitch up in the initial climb. At an altitude between 100-150 feet above the runway, the airplane suddenly yawed to the left while maintaining a nose-up pitch attitude. The airplane then appeared to slow down such that he believed it was about to stall. The left wing dropped, and the airplane rolled left and continued as the nose dropped and the airplane struck the ground inverted. Another witness described the airplane yawing from left to right while climbing. The airplane then rolled left and eventually became inverted, in a manner he described as similar to a barrel roll. The airplane then exited his field of view. After impact, the airplane slid about 650 feet across the ramp on a 060-degree magnetic heading before it collided with an 8-feet tall concrete wall. No evidence was found of any preexisting mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation of the airplane. Toxicology testing revealed the pilot's use of multiple psychoactive substances including marijuana, venlafaxine, amphetamine, pseudoephedrine, clonazepam, and pheniramine. The wide variety of psychoactive effects of these medications precludes predicting the specific effects of their use in combination. However, it is likely that the pilot was impaired by the effects of the combination of psychoactive substances he was using and that those effects contributed to his loss of control. The investigation was unable to obtain medical records regarding any underlying neuropsychiatric disease(s); therefore, whether these may have contributed to the accident circumstances could not be determined.

The pilot and his passenger suffered fatal injuries. The aircraft was flying a display during the City of Perth Australia Day Skyworks 2017 event. It departed Serpentine Airport at 16:28 and proceeded along the coast towards Perth. A holding pattern was flown to the east of Garden Island at an altitude of approximately 1600 feet, waiting to fly a display. At 16:50 it continued flying north towards Perth in company with a Cessna Caravan amphibian. Both aircraft conducted a series of circuits that included low-level fly-pasts of the Langley Park foreshore. After the second fly-past, the pilot of VH-CQA commenced a third circuit, while the Caravan departed the area. As part of the third circuit, the pilot of the Mallard flew in an easterly direction, parallel with the South Perth foreshore, before commencing a left turn. This would have facilitated a third pass in a westerly direction along the Langley Park foreshore. During the left turn, the aircraft rolled left and pitched nose down, consistent with an aerodynamic stall. The aircraft collided with the water and broke up. The pilot and passenger were fatally injured. Contributing factors: - The pilot returned the aircraft to the display area for a third pass in a manner contrary to the approved inbound procedure and which required the use of increased manoeuvring within a confined area to establish the aircraft on the display path. - During the final positioning turn for the third pass, the aircraft aerodynamically stalled at an unrecoverable height. - The pilot's decision to carry a passenger on a flight during the air display was contrary to the Instrument of Approval issued by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority for this air display and increased the severity of the accident consequence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ATSB Report number: AO-2017-013 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: The Courier Mail, 26-1-2017  Flightradar24  ATSB   Location  Images: photo (c) Jim Woodrow; Swan River, Perth, WA; 26 January 2017 photo (c) Jim Woodrow; Swan River, Perth, WA; 26 January 2017 photo (c) Flightaware / Google; Swan River, Perth, WA; 26 January 2017 photo (c) ATSB / Google; Swan River, Perth, WA; 26 January 2017 photo (c) Robert Frola; Watts Bridge Airport (YWSG); 10 April 2016 photo (c) Martin Watson; Watts Bridge Airport (YWSG); September 2015 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft took off from the BogotÃ¡ Airport at 15:50 hours local time. The flight was normal and the aircraft was cleared for the VOR approach to runway 21. The controller notified the crew of a 350Â° wind at 4 knots and a wet runway. At 16:57, the aircraft touched down abeam taxiway Alpha. Immediately afterwards, when the deceleration began, with the application of the reverses, an explosion occurred. The crew observed that the auto-braking system was not operating, so they decided to deactivate it and execute manual braking. Both captain and first officer failed to get a response when applying the brakes so the captain decided to activate the reversers again with 400 metres of runway remaining. The aircraft continued to roll and crossed the threshold stopping in the safety zone, twenty meters from the runway threshold. Approximately one minute after the plane stopped, the crew opened the cargo door and evacuated by their own means; the four occupants were unharmed. Probable cause(s) The investigation determined that the accident was caused by the following causal factors: Poor maintenance procedures of the aircraft operator, by not applying complete and adequate corrective actions to determine the root cause of repeated tire failure. Brake system failure as a result of a break in the hydraulic lines and harness housed in the right landing gear compartment caused by pieces of rubber from tire No. 4 bursting during the landing run. Bursting of tire No. 4 due to the over bending action it suffered as a result of being inflated and over inflated repeatedly, due to different reports of low tire pressure. Runway departure during the deceleration during the landing manoeuvre in Leticia. Contributing Factors Inadequate risk management of the Operator, since the repeated reports of discrepancies were not known or dealt with by its Operational Safety Management area. Poor conditions in the safety zone, in the extension of the Leticia aerodrome's header 03, whose unevenness and flooding contributed to the damage to the aircraft.METAR: 00:00 UTC / 19:00 local time: SKLT 290000Z 00000KT 8000 -DZ BKN010 25/25 A2984 RMK AD OPER IMC21:00 UTC / 16:00 local time: SKLT 282100Z 00000KT 9999 SCT010 BKN015 27/24 A298222:00 UTC / 17:00 local time: SKLT 282200Z 32003KT 9999 -DZ SCT010 BKN015 27/24 A2980 RERA23:00 UTC / 18:00 local time: SKLT 282300Z 00000KT 9999 -RA BKN010 BKN080 26/24 A2986 RMK AD OPER IMCAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: Aerocivil Report number: COL-17-05-GIA Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Aerocivil   Location  Images: photo (c) Leslie Snelleman; Sydney-Kingsford Smith International Airport, NSW (SYD/YSSY); 20 January 2007 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

About three minutes into the flight there was a failure of the left main and essential bus that prompted a return to Freeport. Upon landing on runway 06, there was a collapse of the left main gear and subsequently a runway excursion occurred. Minor injuries were reported to passengers. The Air Accident Investigation Department has determined that the probable cause of this accident was ineffective crew resource management and an unstable approach which led to the failure of the left main landing gear upon touchdown. Contributing factors to this accident includes; inadequate systems knowledge, lack of situational awareness and failure to diagnose and remedy multiple system failures in a timely manner resulted in compound failures being escalated to an emergency. The apparent rush to get on the ground without exploring other possible options to identify and verify landing gear security also contributed to the severity of this accident. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS - Ineffective CRM, complacency and a complete departure from company standard operating procedures and regulatory requirements were evidently a contributing factor in this accident. - Inadequate training and systems knowledge of both airman greatly contributed to the accident. - Hurried approach to get on the ground and failure to explore all available options to remedy the gear unsafe situation encountered was also a contributory factor.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAID Bahamas Report number: A17-000602 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Air Accident Investigation Department of The Bahamas   Location  Images: photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Nassau-Lynden Pindling International Airport (NAS/MYNN); 03 January 2015 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight crew was trying to initiate a right hand turn on the ramp after landing to park the aircraft and during the manoeuvre, they felt the aircraft started to slip on the slippery surface. The captain tried to do a recovery manoeuvre by applying differential power, reverse, and braking, however these manoeuvres were unsuccessful. The left wing came into contact with the airport building, sheering off the left winglet and wing tip down to the wing rib located below the wing fence. The aircraft continued past the building before coming to rest with the winglet and debris resting behind it. The 4 passengers and 2 crew members disembarked without any injury. Company maintenance inspected the aircraft and concluded that there was no structural damage. During this inspection, the engine rigging was checked to ensure that power management was not a factor in this event. No major discrepancies were found and ground runs were normal. The left wing tip and light assembly were replaced and the aircraft returned to service. There have been no further issues with the operation of this aircraft.Sources: CADORS 2017C0494  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft was conducting a charter passenger flight from Essendon Airport to King Island, Tasmania.  The four passengers arrived at the terminal at 08:41 and were escorted by the pilot directly to the aircraft. At 08:49, the left engine was started and, shortly after, the right engine was started. At 08:53, the pilot requested a taxi clearance for King Island, with five persons onboard, under the instrument flight rules. He was cleared to taxi to holding point Tango for runway 17. At 08:58, ATC cleared the flight for take-off on runway 17 with departure instructions to turn right onto a heading of 200Â°. The pilot read back the instruction and commenced the takeoff roll. The aircraftÂs take-off roll along runway 17 was longer than expected. Witnesses familiar with the aircraft type observed a noticeable yaw to the left after the aircraft became airborne. The aircraft entered a relatively shallow climb and the landing gear remained down. The shallow climb was followed by a substantial left sideslip, while maintaining a roll attitude of less than 10Â° to the left. Airservices ADS-B data indicated the aircraft reached a maximum height of approximately 160 ft above ground level while tracking in an arc to the left of the runway centreline . The aircraftÂs track began diverging to the left of the runway centreline before rotation and the  Following the sustained left sideslip, the aircraft began to descend and at 08:58:48 the pilot transmitted on the Essendon Tower frequency repeating the word 'MAYDAY' seven times in rapid succession. Approximately 10 seconds after the aircraft became airborne, and 2 seconds after the transmission was completed, the aircraft collided with the roof of a building in the Essendon Airport Bulla Road Precinct - Retail Outlet Centre, coming to rest in a loading area at the rear of the building. Contributing factors - The aircraft's rudder trim was likely in the full nose-left position at the commencement of the take-off. - The aircraft's full nose-left rudder trim setting was not detected by the pilot prior to take-off. - Following a longer than expected ground roll, the pilot took-off with full left rudder trim selected. This configuration adversely affected the aircraft's climb performance and controllability, resulting in a collision with terrain. Other factors that increased risk: - The flight check system approval process did not identify that the incorrect checklist was nominated in the operatorÂs procedures manual and it did not ensure the required checks, related to the use of the cockpit voice recorder, were incorporated. - The aircraft's cockpit voice recorder did not record the accident flight, resulting in a valuable source of safety related information not being available. - The aircraft's maximum take-off weight was likely exceeded by about 240 kilograms. - Two of the four buildings within the Bulla Road Precinct Retail Outlet Centre exceeded the obstacle limitation surface (OLS) for Essendon Airport, however, the OLS for the departure runway was not infringed and VH-ZCR did not collide with those buildings.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ATSB Report number: AO-2017-024 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: ATSB  The Age   Location  Images: photo (c) ATSB; Melbourne-Essendon Airport, VIC (MEB); 21 February 2017 photo (c) ATSB; Melbourne-Essendon Airport, VIC (MEB); 21 February 2017 photo (c) ATSB; Melbourne-Essendon Airport, VIC (MEB); 21 February 2017 photo (c) Alec Wilson; Melbourne-Essendon Airport, VIC (MEB); 24 November 2014; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

On February 23, 2017, the aircraft was due to operate a return flight from Isle Of Man-Ronaldsway Airport (IOM) to Belfast City Airport, Northern Ireland. The scheduled departure time was 07:15 UTC and the return flight was scheduled to arrive back at IOM at 08:50. Overnight and into the morning of the 23 February, Storm Doris underwent explosive cyclogenesis. The centre of the storm moved rapidly through Northern Ireland in the early hours, across northern England and out into the North Sea by the early afternoon. Strong winds were forecast for the area. The surface wind at Belfast, where runways 04 and 22 were available, was reported at 06:20 to be from 230Â° at 9 kt but, because they received no TAF for this destination, the pilots selected two alternate airports; Belfast International Airport and IOM. The latest weather information at IOM showed a wind from 230Â° at 32 kt gusting to 45 kt, creating a maximum crosswind component of 22 kt. The relevant maximum demonstrated crosswind component for the Let L-410 is 19.4 kt and this was included in the ÂPerformance LimitationsÂ section of the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) but the aircraft operator did not apply a limiting component of crosswind to its operations. The only wind limit that was applied and used by the crew was 45 kt for ground operation. When the wind changed to 260Â° at 39, gusting to 55 kt, the flight was delayed because this exceeded the ground operation limit, Departure At 07:50 the crew learnt the wind was from 290Â° at 31 G 40 kt and as both these more recent reports were within the ground operation limit, they decided to depart, with 550 kg of fuel on board.  Three passengers boarded and the aircraft taxied at 08:10. Shortly afterwards, at the request of Belfast City ATC, the crew were informed that the wind was from 320Â° at 31 G 46 kt, and IOM ATC asked the crew for their intentions because Belfast City ATC had reported no other known aircraft movements. The crew elected to continue the flight and took off on runway 26 at 08:23 hrs, when the reported wind was from 290Â° at 21 G 41 kt. The co-pilot was the Pilot Flying (PF) and the commander was Pilot Not Flying (PNF). No difficulties were encountered en route to Belfast. When the PNF contacted Belfast City ATC, he was told radar vectoring was available for an ILS approach to runway 04 and that the wind was now from 320Â° at 28 G 43 kt. The PNF informed ATC they would make one approach but would go around if the approach was not stable. The crew reported afterwards that they experienced continuous moderate turbulence during the latter part of the approach. The final wind check, given after they had been cleared to land, was from 320Â° at 35 kt. They judged that the aircraft operatorÂs stable approach criteria were met until the aircraft passed over the runway threshold, when turbulence de-stabilised the aircraft and they initiated a go-around. ATC reported that the aircraft went around from approximately 20 ft above the runway at 08:58 hrs and climbed straight ahead to 3,000 ft amsl, the standard missed approach procedure. The aircraft continued heading northeast until 09:01 hrs when the PNF informed ATC they would not make a second approach and would return to IOM. Return Once level at FL070, the PNF listened to the ATIS for the IOM, which stated runway 26 was in use, it was wet, and detailed the 0850 METAR, which noted that the wind was from 290Â° at 28 kt. The PF briefed for an approach with the flaps set to 18Â°, and a target VREF of 105 kt; with a ""slightly right crosswind"". After the brief was completed he commented on the intercom that the wind was ""not so challenging"" at IOM but shortly after this ATC provided a special weather observation, timed at 09:12 hrs, which stated the wind was now from 310Â° at 41 kt and gusting between 22 and 53 kt. When asked by ATC if they wished to make an approach, the PNF replied ""of course"". The crew accepted radar vectoring for an ILS approach to runway 26, with the co-pilot remaining as PF. Before the aircraft was directed towards its final approach, ATC reported the wind was from 310Â° at 43 kt but gusting between 23 and 63 kt. At 09:24, after the aircraft had become established on the ILS centreline and glideslope, ATC radioed clearance to land, with a reported wind of 300Â° at 41 kt but gusting between 31 and 63 kt. While receiving this message, the crew were also presented with an aural ""glideslope"" caution and immediately after this the PF declared ""1,000 ft stabilised"". While the PNF was adjusting the propeller rpm, another aural ""glideslope"" caution was annunciated and the PF immediately stated ""correcting"". Following an automatically generated message stating the aircraft was at 500 ft agl, one further ""glideslope"" caution was annunciated and the PF responded saying ""correcting, runway in sight"". The final wind check provided by ATC, approximately 35 seconds before the aircraft touched down, was from 300Â° at 48 kt, but gusting between 32 kt and 63 kt.  Landing Given the environmental conditions, ATC was concerned for the safety of the aircraft and its occupants when it landed, so the airfield Rescue and Fire Fighting Service (RFFS) had been placed on alert with two vehicles facing towards the runway, approximately 200 m from the touchdown zone. During the aircraftÂs approach, ATC discussed the situation with the Isle of Man Civil Aviation Administration because another of the same operatorÂs aircraft had been blown onto its wingtip while taxiing in 2007, in winds greater than 45 kt, and both parties knew 45 kt was now the operatorÂs maximum ground operation limit. As the aircraft crossed the threshold it seemed unstable and it rolled considerably, causing the tip of the left wing (the downwind wing) to tilt down until it seemed in close proximity to the runway, before the wheels made first contact. The aircraft then bounced and rolled left again before touching down for a second time, on all three wheels. After travelling along the runway for approximately 20 m, the right mainwheel was seen to lift off the ground and nearby RFFS witnesses estimated the left wingtip rolled to within one metre of the runway surface. The crew seemed aware of this roll because, approximately nine seconds after touchdown, the PF stated ""ailerons...good...too much roll"".  After landing the commander took control and the co-pilot commented ""taxi carefully with the wind"". ATC then stated the surface wind was from 300Â° at 47 kt, but gusting between 32 kt and 63 kt and asked if they wished to taxi or to hold on the runway. The crew replied ""we will try and taxi and if we can make it we will vacate, otherwise we need to leave the aircraft here"". The crew then accepted taxi instructions directing them towards the terminal but, 45 seconds later, as the aircraft was leaving the runway, ATC radioed to the crew, ""direction from Isle of Man CAA, hold position."" The aircraft stopped facing into the wind. Both ATC and the Isle of Man Civil Aviation Administration later indicated that they were concerned that if the aircraft continued to taxi with the wind gusting to 63 kt an accident could occur.  RFFS vehicles were positioned around the aircraft, to provide some screening from the wind, and a bus transferred the three uninjured passengers to the terminal building. The aircraft was later tied down until the wind subsided. Conclusion: The prime causal factor in this serious incident was the decision to land with a maximum crosswind component of 40 kt, which is approximately twice the maximum demonstrated certification value of 19.4 kt. In the view of the aircraft operator, there was no specific crosswind limit the crew needed to consider when deciding whether to operate the service or not. However, the OM Part A refers to a crosswind limit when it states: ÂFor planning purposes an aerodrome shall be considered below minimum if the steady crosswind exceeds the prescribed limitations.Â and other evidence from the AFM and the OM indicates that the maximum demonstrated crosswind component of 19.4 kt was limiting. Several contributory factors were also apparent: 1) By only studying weather reports for six airfields and without referring to any meteorology charts, the crew had insufficient information to assess the prevailing weather conditions en route and the stormÂs path. 2) The aircraft operator believed that a valid TAF could be disregarded upon the subsequent issue of a METAR that included a TREND forecast. 3) The aircraft operator did not provide adequate oversight to a flight in airspace affected by this storm. The commander did not refer to the available weather forecast charts and neither the OCC nor the FOM reviewed the situation with him, or suggested he seek guidance from the duty forecaster. 4) The fuel figures presented on the OFP did not account for the correct level of contingency fuel and did not allow for a realistic alternate routing. The aircraft had sufficient fuel for the sector, but the crew did not have as much extra fuel on-board as they believed they had, and the OM offered little guidance on the carriage of extra fuel when there was a possibility of widespread, adverse weather conditions. 5) The OFP only showed navigational and fuel information for the second of two selected alternates. However, the two Belfast airports are in close proximity so the lack of navigational information for the routing to the first alternate may not have been problematic in this instance. 6) The CVR evidence, that evolving threats did not precipitate verbal discussion between the pilots, indicates they had not been effectively trained in respect to CRM, and to threat management in particular. The OM appeared to lack guidance concerning the evaluation and management of threats, problem solving and decision making. 7) The approach became unstable before visual flight conditions were achieved, but the crew did not discuss this, and the required SOPs were not followed. 8) The limiting airspeed for flight with gear down and for flight with flaps extended was exceeded but no corrective action was taken. 9) The crew began taxiing the aircraft in a wind which was stronger than the wind which blew a similar aircraft onto its wingtip at IOM in 2007 and which exceeded the ground operation limit introduced after the 2007 accident.METAR: 06:20 UTC / 06:20 local time: EGNS 230620Z 23032G45KT 7000 -RA FEW012 SCT022 BKN030 07/04 Q0977 BECMG 31017KT07:20 UTC / 07:20 local time: EGNS 230720Z 25033G47KT 220V290 3000 RA FEW005 BKN008 OVC015 06/05 Q0973 NOSIG08:20 UTC / 08:20 local time: EGAC 230820Z 31029G46KT 9999 -SHRA FEW009 BKN012 03/01 Q098108:20 UTC / 08:20 local time: EGNS 230820Z 29029G42KT 5000 -RA FEW006 BKN009 BKN022 07/05 Q0975 TEMPO 3000 RA BKN007 [approx departure time]09:20 UTC / 09:20 local time: EGAC 230920Z 31023G40KT 9999 -RADZ FEW010 BKN014 04/02 Q098609:20 UTC / 09:20 local time: EGNS 230920Z 30042G56KT 4000 RA FEW005 BKN011 BKN033 05/03 Q0979 TEMPO 3000 BKN006 [approx landing time]10:20 UTC / 09:20 local time: EGNS 231020Z 30042G58KT 9999 -RA FEW009 BKN015 OVC025 05/02 Q0984 TEMPO 5000 RA BKN00611:20 UTC / 09:20 local time: EGNS 231120Z 30043G56KT 9000 -RA FEW012 SCT016 BKN028 06/03 Q0986 TEMPO 5000 BKN006Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: EW/C2017/02/04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  29 November 2018 OK-LAZ Van Air Europe, opf Trade Air 0 Dubrovnik Airport (LDDU) non Wrong runway/taxiway landing Location  Images: photo (c) AAIB; Isle Of Man-Ronaldsway Airport (IOM); February 2017 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft departed Edinburgh, Scotland, on a scheduled passenger service to Amsterdam at 14:21 UTC. About 15:22 UTC the aircraft entered a holding pattern over the North Sea off the western coast of the Netherlands because landing runways available were limited at Schiphol because of the strong surface wind.  It left the holding about 15:38 UTC and positioned for an ILS approach to runway 22. During the approach to Schiphol, at approximately 16:30 hours, ATC requested the crew to hold over reporting point SUGOL at flight level (FL) 110 for 20 minutes because landing runways available were limited at Schiphol because of the strong surface wind. ATIS information ÂKiloÂ reported winds from direction 240Â° with a velocity of 35 knots, gusting to 40 knots. METAR information reported winds at 37 knots gusting to 46 at 15.55 (UTC, 16.55 local time). From SUGOL the crew initially received radar vectors inbound Schiphol. They then were cleared to intercept the Instrument Landing System (ILS) for runway 22. The ILS for the approach to runway 22 was intercepted at 18 NM.  During the descent, at 15:49 UTC, the autopilot disengaged because of gusting winds in the approach and was reengaged by the crew shortly after. The arrival was flown in speed control mode with an airspeed of 170 knots. Final speed was selected at 130 knots, i.e. normal landing threshold speed (VREF) plus 10 knots to compensate for the gusting winds. At around 15:51 UTC, approximately 5.5 NM from the runway touchdown point, the landing gear was selected down, giving three greens indication in the cockpit shortly after. The crew confirmed the indication, 15 degrees flaps were selected and de-icing systems were selected. The crew then changed radio frequency to Schiphol Tower and received a clearance for landing on runway 22. The air traffic controller reported the wind from direction 240 degrees with speeds of 36 knots gusting to 48 knots. The crew finished the before landing checklist. They then selected 5 degrees flaps and selected gear down. They confirmed Âice protection onÂ, Âlanding gear three greensÂ, selected 15 degrees flaps and checked Âbleed air onÂ. At an altitude of 300 feet the flight crew disengaged the autopilot for landing. On short final the crew noticed the PAPI showing they were on the glide path. Although the pilots were aware they would encounter strong winds during landing, including crosswinds, the wind conditions were not extreme and were not above the aircraftÂs limitations. Short final was flown under crosswind conditions, with the nose of the aircraft about 20 degrees right of centre line. Just before touch down the pilot flying aligned the nose of the aircraft with the runway centreline and lowered the right wing to compensate for the crosswind, causing the right-hand main wheel to touch the runway first. The aircraft touched down at 15:54 UTC. The crew considered the landing to be firm, but not hard. Almost immediately after touch down the crew noticed the right wing dropping, and a red warning light appeared on the landing gear panel in the cockpit. The right-hand propeller, right-hand engine nacelle, lower fuselage, wing tip and aileron collided with the runway and the aircraft continued for several hundred meters before coming to a complete stop. This resulted in damage to the right hand propeller, the lower fuselage structure and right-hand outboard wing tip. The right-hand fuselage was also damaged due to fragments from the right-hand propeller and stone strikes. The left-hand main landing gear and nose gear remained extended. The crew transmitted a MAYDAY call and after coming to a complete stop the cabin attendants started evacuating the passengers via the two aft doors. The crew then shut down the aircraft in accordance with the checklist. As a precaution, they also pulled the circuit breakers from the flight data and cockpit voice recorders. During the accident and following evacuation no-one was injured. Conclusions: - Maintenance was performed on the night before the day of the mishap flight, during maintenance the MLG brace was replaced. The maintenance crew stated they did not find anything unusual during the installation of the brace. - After the accident, the newly installed stabilizer brace showed no deformation, nor did the attachment lugs on the yoke or the forward nacelle. - The PSEU showed several fault codes which were consistent with the condition of the aircraft during the approach and after the incident. - One of the MLG down lock sensors was found unreliable. The faulty sensor prevented the PSEU logic from closing the aft RH MLG doors and activating the unlock actuator. - The unlock actuator not being activated prevented the brace being aided to maintain its over centred position by hydraulic pressure. - The RH MLG yoke was found deformed. Analyses, and the fact no deformation was present on the stabilizer brace assembly, indicate that the deformation on the yoke was present prior to touchdown at Schiphol, and that this deformation was caused when NO stabilizer brace assembly was installed. - The deformation of the yoke placed the RH MLG in a condition outside the certification state, thereby exposing the RH MLG stabilizer brace assembly to the potential of unlocking. - The bent yoke caused friction in the MLG yoke and brace combination, which prevented at least one of the two stabilizer brace apex joints from achieving an over centre condition when the MLG was extended prior to landing. Although not designed for this, not hydraulically activating the unlock actuator after the gear was in the down position, prevented the brace assembly from being retained into over centre position. - Despite the fact the gear was not fully locked, and outside certification condition, three green lights indicated to the crew that the gear was down and locked. Although not noticed by the flying crew, the amber caution light indicating the aft RH MLG were open, most likely was lit during landing. - The combination of friction caused by the bent yoke, and faulty sensors preventing the unlock actuator to be activated, caused a situation whereby the stabilizer brace of the RH MLG did not get into over centre position causing an instable situation, despite the three LG green lights illuminated. - During an asymmetric (rolled) touchdown in Amsterdam torsion loads were applied to the MLG, and the MLG strut collapsed almost immediately after touchdown of the RH MLG, causing the accident to happen.METAR: 14:55 UTC / 15:55 local time: EHAM 231455Z 23034G48KT 180V260 9999 FEW022 09/03 Q0985 TEMPO 7000 -RA BKN02015:25 UTC / 16:25 local time: EHAM 231525Z 24037G51KT 9999 -RA FEW020 SCT032 08/04 Q0985 TEMPO 7000 BKN02015:55 UTC / 16:55 local time: EHAM 231555Z 24031G46KT 210V270 9999 -RA FEW020 SCT028 BKN037 08/04 Q0985 TEMPO 7000 BKN020Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Dutch Safety Board Report number: 2017016 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) Onderzoeksraad voor Veiligheid; Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS); 23 February 2017 photo (c) Onderzoeksraad voor Veiligheid; Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS); 23 February 2017 photo (c) Onderzoeksraad voor Veiligheid; Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS); 23 February 2017 photo (c) Onderzoeksraad voor Veiligheid; Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS); 23 February 2017 photo (c) Flightradar24; Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS); 23 February 2017 photo (c) Werner Fischdick; DÃ¼sseldorf International Airport (DUS/EDDL); 15 June 2013 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

During the pushback from Stand 1 at Manchester Airport, in dark and wet conditions, the flight deck crew felt a fore and aft jolt and heard a mechanical ""clunk"". The commander informed the headset operator who conferred with the tug driver, and then visually checked the towbar and its attachment to the tug and to the aircraft. The ground crew saw nothing abnormal and they assumed the clunk was due to the tow hitch shifting, which is a familiar occurrence. The headset operator informed the commander that all was well, and the pushback continued. In response to a request from the commander, the headset operator indicated the left engine could be started, although the aircraft had not reached the designated engine start positon for that stand. As the aircraft was halted, in preparation for being pulled forward to the release point, the headset operator approved a request from the flight deck crew to start the right engine. The commander was conscious of the aircraft beginning to move gently forward, while he was concentrating on starting the right engine. Both the tug and the headset operator were concealed from his field of view and he was not surprised when the aircraftÂs nose turned first to the right and then to the left, as if it was being lined-up on the taxiway centreline. He then heard an urgent instruction from the headset operator for the brakes to be applied, so he responded by pressing on the toe brakes before setting the park brake. The headset operator then informed him that the tug and aircraft had collided, but that nobody was injured. Both engines were then shut down. Ground crew from adjacent stands came to assist and found the towbar was still connected to both the tug and to the aircraft. The nose gear leg was rotated approximately 90Â° to the left and the tow bar was bent around the front corner of the tug. The shear pins on the towbar had fractured, and pieces were later found within the boundary of the stand, but the central retaining pin remained intact. The passengers and crew disembarked without injury from the rear right exit door. An investigation by the ground handling company showed One of the pins on this towbar had failed 16 days before the accident and only that pin had been replaced. It was also established that other maintenance procedures for the shear pins had not been followed. They had not been lubricated correctly and the training given to ground crews did not prepare them for conducting adequate serviceability checks on the pins.

The aircraft had been chartered by the University of Michigan Basketball team for a flight to a game in Washington, DC. The flight crew prepared for take-off and calculated V-speeds (V1, VR, V2) using ""Normal Thrust Takeoff"", a 10 kts headwind, and a take-off weight of 146,600 lbs. The V-speeds for this configuration were 139 kts, 142 kts, and 150 kts, respectively. However, the flight crew chose to increase VR to 150 kts to allow for more control during take-off in the presence of windshear. During takeoff roll, at 14:51:56 (about 3,000 ft down the runway) and about 138 kts of airspeed, the control column was pulled back slightly from a non-dimensional value of -7 to -5.52. The airplaneÂs left elevator followed the control input and moved from a position of -15Â° trailing edge down to -13Â° trailing edge down. The right elevator did not change and stayed at approximately -16Â° trailing edge down. At 14:52:01 a large control column input was made (151 kts and 4100 ft down the runway) to a non-dimensional 18.5 and the left elevator moves to a position near 15Â° trailing edge up. After 14:52:05 the right elevator moves to -13Â° trailing edge down, but no more. The airplane does not respond in pitch and does not rotate. The captain decided to abort the takeoff. The maximum groundspeed was 163 kts (173 kts airspeed) and the airplane began to decelerate as soon as the brakes were applied at 14:52:08. Spoilers were deployed at 14:52:10 and thrust reversers were deployed between 14:52:13 and 14:52:15. The aircraft could not be stopped on the runway. The airplaneÂs ground speed was 100 kts when it left the paved surface. The aircraft overran the end of the runway, damaged approach lights, went through the perimeter fence and crossed Tyler Road. It came to rest on grassy terrain, 345 meters past the end of the runway, with the rear fuselage across a ditch. The nose landing gear had collapsed.  Runway 23L is a 7543 ft long runway. Post-accident examination by the NTSB revealed movement of the control column in the cockpit appeared normal; the control columns were free to move, and the elevator control tabs moved as commanded. However, when investigators tried to move the elevator surfaces by hand, the left elevator moved normally, but the right elevator was jammed in a trailing edge-down position (airplane nose down). Upon further inspection, the right elevator geared tab inboard pushrod linkage was found damaged which restricted movement of the right elevator surface but allowed movement of the control tab. After the damaged components were removed, the elevator could be moved by hand. Examination of the flight data recorder data indicates that during the taxi and take-off roll, the left elevator moved normally, but the right elevator did not move. During takeoff roll, the left elevator began a large airplane nose-up movement (consistent with rotation) at an airspeed of about 152 knots and continued for five seconds to about 166 knots. There was no change in the airplane pitch attitude during this time. The airplane data then are consistent with the takeoff being rejected. The maximum recorded airspeed was about 173 knots. Review of previous flight data showed normal movement of both the left and right elevator surfaces.  The airplane flew to Ypsilanti two days before the accident. Probable Cause: ""The NTSB determines that the probable cause of this accident was the jammed condition of the airplaneÂs right elevator, which resulted from exposure to localized, dynamic wind while the airplane was parked and rendered the airplane unable to rotate during takeoff. Contributing to the accident were (1) the effect of a large structure on the gusting surface wind at the airplaneÂs parked location, which led to turbulent gust loads on the right elevator sufficient to jam it, even though the horizontal surface wind speed was below the certification design limit and maintenance inspection criteria for the airplane, and (2) the lack of a means to enable the flight crew to detect a jammed elevator during preflight checks for the Boeing MD-83 airplane. Contributing to the survivability of the accident was the captainÂs timely and appropriate decision to reject the takeoff, the check airmanÂs disciplined adherence to standard operating procedures after the captain called for the rejected takeoff, and the dimensionally compliant runway safety area where the overrun occurred.""METAR: 16:53 UTC / 11:53 local time: KYIP 081653Z 26035G50KT 10SM CLR 11/M11 A2981 RMK AO2 PK WND 26055/1639 SLP095 T0106110617:53 UTC / 12:53 local time: KYIP 081753Z A2979 RMK AO2 PK WND 24046/1656 SLPNO 58012 $19:53 UTC / 14:55 local time: KDTW 081953Z 26033G44KT 10SM FEW050 12/M14 A2980 RMK AO2 PK WND 24051/1926 SLP095 T01171144Weather for Detroit Metro Airport, 13 km east of KYIPAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NTSB/AAR-19/01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 12 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: WXYZ  FAA  M Live  NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Detroit-Willow Run Airport, MI (YIP); March 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Detroit-Willow Run Airport, MI (YIP); March 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Detroit-Willow Run Airport, MI (YIP); March 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Detroit-Willow Run Airport, MI (YIP); March 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Detroit-Willow Run Airport, MI (YIP); March 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Detroit-Willow Run Airport, MI (YIP); March 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Detroit-Willow Run Airport, MI (YIP); March 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Detroit-Willow Run Airport, MI (YIP); March 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Detroit-Willow Run Airport, MI (YIP); March 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Detroit-Willow Run Airport, MI (YIP); March 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Detroit-Willow Run Airport, MI (YIP); March 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Detroit-Willow Run Airport, MI (YIP); March 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Detroit-Willow Run Airport, MI (YIP); March 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) Google Earth; Detroit-Willow Run Airport, MI (YIP); 08 March 2017 photo (c) NTSB; Detroit-Willow Run Airport, MI (YIP); 08 March 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) Adam Moreira; New York-John F.

The aircraft came to rest on the right side of the runway. The nose landing gear had collapsed and the right hand wing tip was bent. Kalaupapa Airport is an uncontrolled (nontowered) airport with a single runway and no taxiways. The pilots use a common frequency to state their intentions.  The pilot of the Grand Caravan reported that she was going to establish an approach and landing to runway 05. While on a seven-mile final, she communicated with the pilot of an airplane that was on short final for the same airport. The pilot that was on short final reported that he would report when he was clear of the runway, and he did. The commuter pilot acknowledged the other pilot's clear of runway transmission, and initiated the approach.  As the pilot descended through 150 feet above ground level, she noticed that the airplane that she had communicated with was not clear of the runway. The airplane on the ground was near the runway 23 numbers with the propeller turning, facing toward her landing airplane. She aborted the landing but the airplane did not climb.

The aircraft was on a scheduled passenger flight from Perth Airport and had two flight crew, five cabin crew, and 177 passengers on board. The first officer was the Pilot Flying (PF) and the Captain was performing the role of the Pilot Monitoring (PM). Air traffic control (ATC) cleared the flight to descend and advised its flight crew to expect an arrival on runway 17. The controller also requested that the crew maintain maximum speed. In response, a descent speed of 320 kt was selected, 40 kt above the standard descent speed of 280 kt. The aircraftâs maximum allowable operating speed (VMO) was 340 kt. At about 22:00, the flight crew informed ATC that descent from flight level (FL) 310 had commenced and reported some light to moderate turbulence. Shortly after, ATC informed the flight crew that there would be a runway change to 35. At about 22:04, the flight was descending past FL 280 when the flight crew made an announcement over the aircraftâs public address system advising the cabin crew to prepare for landing. That announcement provided a cue to the cabin crew that they had about 10 minutes to secure all loose items in the cabin before illumination of the âfasten seat beltâ sign. By the time the aircraft passed FL 270, it had accelerated to the flight crew selected speed of 320 kt. At about 22:09, the turbulence began to increase. In response, the flight crew switched on the âfasten seat beltâ sign and advised the passengers and crew to be seated with seat belts fastened. The operatorâs procedures required cabin crew members to be seated within 1 minute of that announcement. At that time, a cabin crew member was passing row 22 on her way back to the rear of the cabin. The aircraftâs movement due to the turbulence was such that she needed to hold onto the overhead lockers as she walked along the aisle. About 15 seconds later, she reached the rear galley, closed a stowage latch, and secured a rubbish bin in preparation to be seated in the left cabin crew seat. When the flight descended through FL 220 (about 30 seconds after the âfasten seat beltâ sign was switched on), the wind direction changed by about 80 degrees, resulting in a head wind increase from 15 kt to 32 kt. That in turn led to the airspeed increasing through 325 kt, and the PF applying control column backpressure to avoid exceeding VMO. About 1 second after the maximum control column force was applied, the autopilot disengaged and the G-Load4 peaked at 2.2 g. The pilot monitoring reported that they were checking the instrument approach, as a result of the change to runway 35, when they heard the autopilot disengage tone and saw the speed of the aircraft increasing toward VMO. The aircraftâs pitch angle changed by 3.87 degrees in 1 second, and its airspeed reached a maximum of 339.5 kt. The cabin crew member recalled that, while standing in the rear galley and preparing for arrival, she felt the cabin floor drop and then quickly come up. The force due to the aircraftâs movement resulted in the cabin crew member fracturing her leg. The cabin crew member seated in the right rear seat assisted the injured cabin crew member. The aircraft movement also resulted in a second cabin crew member in the forward galley falling forward and hitting her head on a trolley. She also received injuries to her knees, back and neck. The flight crew received an interphone call from the cabin reporting the leg fracture injury. The turbulence subsided and the flight crew turned off the âfasten seat beltâ sign and first aid was provided to the injured crew members. At about 22:11, the aircraftâs speed decreased and the flight crew re-engaged the autopilot. The flight crew alerted ATC to the turbulence and were informed that no other turbulence had been reported in the area. Due to her fractured leg, the injured crew member in the rear galley remained lying on the cabin floor for the landing. The aircraft landed at about 22:34, and paramedics met the aircraft to attend to the two injured cabin crew members. Both of them were transferred to a hospital for treatment. The cabin crew member injured in the rear galley was admitted to the hospital. The other crew member was treated and discharged without admission. The aircraft was not damaged and none of the other crew or any of the passengers were injured. Findings - The increase in headwind while VH-VZZ was making a routine high speed descent at 320 kt resulted in the airspeed increasing towards the aircraftâs maximum allowable speed. - The pilot flying applied a control column input to prevent an overspeed, which resulted in the autopilot unexpectedly disengaging. The consequent change of pitch and g-loading led to two cabin crew suffering injuries. - The aircraftâs autopilot had been modified such that, if sufficient control column back pressure was applied, the autopilot would disengage rather than revert to the Control Wheel Steering (CWS) mode. Autopilot disengagement resulted in larger elevator and pitch responses than those associated with reversion to CWS mode.

There were no injuries, but the aircraft sustained substantial damage. After approximately one hour and ten minutes of flight time, during the descent procedure, the no.2 propeller rpm suddenly increased. The crewmembers performed the procedures set out in the aircraft manuals and proceeded to their destination. The crew carried out an NDB approach to runway 09 at Coari-Urucu Airport in light rain conditions. After touchdown the right propeller did not assume the reverse pitch with the throttle in position below Ground Idle. The aircraft then yawed to the left and veered off the runway approximately 500 m after the touchdown point, traveling about 180 m through the grass. Contributing factors. - Attention Â a contributor. The lack of attention to the lighting of the Low Pitch lights contributed to the application of reverse in both engines, with only one of the lights on. Thus, this action contributed to the asymmetric reverse condition, which allowed the aircraft to exit the runway on the left. - Emotional state Â undetermined. The feeling of apprehension experienced by the crewmembers in relation to the length of the runway, associated with the condition of night operation and in the rain, may have affected their performance, so that, in an attempt to anticipate the engines entering the reverse regime, the standard landing procedures were not properly performed. - Aircraft maintenance Â undetermined. The series of discrepancies identified in the Microswitch Box, PN 11S76180650-10, SN 0199, indicating that the unit could have been opened in an unauthorized location, raised doubts about the quality standard of the services performed on the aircraft, which may have allowed an aircraft grounding condition fault that has affected several aircraft electrical components and caused the Np Cancel function to fail.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CENIPA Report number: A-053/CENIPA/2017 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 years and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates15-Mar-2024 19:49 ASN Updated [Source, Accident report, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The private pilot, and sole occupant, was fatally injured. The airplane was destroyed by the impact and post-impact fire. The flight originated from Cincinnati Airport, Ohio, about 18:12 hours local time, and was destined for Atlanta-Fulton County Airport, Georgia.  The flight was uneventful until the air traffic controller amended the flight plan, which required the pilot to manually enter the new routing information into the GPS. A few minutes later, the pilot told the controller that he was having problems with the GPS and asked for a direct route to his destination. The controller authorized the direct route and instructed the pilot to descend from 22,000 ft to 6,000 ft, during which time the sound of the autopilot disconnect was heard on the cockpit voice recorder. During the descent, the pilot told the controller that the airplane had a steering problem and was in the clouds. The pilot was instructed to descend the airplane to 4,100 ft, which was the minimum vectoring altitude. The airplane continued to descend, entered visual meteorological conditions, and then descended below the assigned altitude. The controller queried the pilot about the airplane's low altitude and instructed the pilot to maintain 4,100 ft. The pilot responded that he was unsure if he would be able to climb the airplane back to that altitude due to steering issues. The controller issued a low altitude warning and again advised the pilot to climb back to 4,100 ft. The pilot responded that the autopilot was working again and that he was able to climb the airplane to the assigned altitude. The controller then instructed the pilot to change to another radio frequency, but the pilot responded that he was still having a problem with the GPS. The pilot asked the controller to give him direct routing to the airport. A few minutes later, the pilot told the controller that he was barely able to keep the airplane straight and its wings level. The controller asked the pilot if he had the airport in sight, which he did not. The pilot then declared an emergency and expressed concerns related to identifying the landing runway. Afterward, radio contact between the controller and the pilot was lost. Shortly before the airplane impacted the ground, a witness saw the airplane make a complete 360Â° roll to the left, enter a steep 90Â° bank to the left, roll inverted, and enter a vertical nose-down dive. Another witness saw the airplane spiral to the ground. The airplane impacted the front lawn of a private residence, and a postcrash fire ensued.  The aircraft was a Sierra Eagle wing conversion of a Cessna 500 Citation I. This performance upgrade also allows single pilot operations. However, the NTSB found no record of the pilot receiving training for single-pilot operations in the accident airplane. Therefore it was unlikely that the pilot was properly certificated to act as a single-pilot. The pilot historically had difficulty flying the airplane without the aid of the autopilot. Given the pilot's previous experience with the GPS installed on the airplane, it is likely that during the accident flight the pilot became confused about how to operate the GPS and ultimately was unable to properly control of the airplane without the autopilot engaged. Probable cause: The pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed while manually flying the airplane, which resulted in the airplane exceeding its critical angle of attack and experiencing an aerodynamic stall. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's inability control the airplane without the aid of the autopilot.METAR: 22:53 UTC / 18:53 local time: KFTY 242253Z 16009KT 10SM SCT060 23/08 A3027 RMK AO2 SLP246 T02280083Weather at Fulton County Airport: wind 160Â° at 9 knots; scattered clouds at 6000 feet; Tempeture 23Â°C, Dew point: 8Â°C23:47 UTC / 19:47 local time: KRYY 242347Z 16008KT 10SM OVC055 21/09 A3028Weather at Cobb Country Airport: wind 160Â° at 8 knots; overcast at 5500 feet; Tempeture 21Â°C, Dew point: 9Â°C23:53 UTC / 19:53 local time: KFTY 242353Z 17006KT 10SM OVC060 22/09 A3028 RMK AO2 SLP250 T02220089 10233 20211 55006Weather at Fulton County Airport: wind 170Â° at 6 knots; overcast at 6000 feet; Tempeture 22Â°C, Dew point: 9Â°CAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA17FA135 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: 11alive  flightaware.com  NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Marietta, GA; March 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) Flightaware / Google Earth; Marietta, GA; 24 March 2017 photo (c) Alec Wilson; Fort Lauderdale-Executive Airport, FL (FXE/KFXE); 11 February 2017 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

After a normal flight, the aircraft started the approach in good weather conditions to runway 31 at Jauja Airport. That day, according to NOTAM CO510/17, maintenance work was being carried out on the runway and only the right side was available.  The landing at the Jauja Airport was made by the First Officer, who was in the qualification stage to operate to high altitude airports. After the contact of the main landing gears and two seconds after the nose gear had touched down, almost simultaneously with the activation of the reverse, the crew felt strong vibrations and oscillations accompanied by pitching up and down. The aircraft bouncing a couple of times in an uncontrolled way and after a loud noise, the right main landing gear collapsed. The crew was unable to maintain directional control of the aircraft because the wheels of the left main landing gear and engine No. 2 moved off the runway on the right side. The engine entered a drainage channel and separated. A fuel spill that ignited, reaching the aircraft that had already stopped.  The pilot simultaneously activated the three ""Engine Fire"" switches and ordered the evacuation of the aircraft from the left side. He ordered the co-pilot to leave the cockpit, as a large amount of smoke was entering. The crew proceeded with the emergency evacuation. No injuries were recorded among the occupants, but the aircraft was de	stroyed as a result of the fire. CAUSE (translated from Spanish) Failure of the mechanical components of the 'SHIMMY DAMPER - SD"" system in each of the main landing gears of the B737-3M8 aircraft, registration number OB2036P, which, being out of tolerance range, did not allow the correct damping of the vibrations and lateral oscillations of the wheels, generating sequential 'SHIMMY"" events in both gears, which resulted in their collapse and breakage, while landing at Francisco CarlÃ© de Jauja Airport CONTRIBUTING FACTORS 1) Incorrect and probable absence of measurements on mechanical components of the ""CIMATIC CHAIN FOR SD OPERATION"", as indicated by the operator's PM AMM Task, which would have allowed for the timely detection and replacement of out-of-tolerance components, ensuring their integrity and correct operation. 2) The Service Letter 737-SL-32-057-E ""BROKEN TORSION LINK"", does not provide for mandatory actions, it only recommends maintenance practices to prevent fractures in mechanical components of the ""CIMMETIC CHAIN FOR SD OPERATION"". 3) Service Letter 737-SL-32-057-E ""FRACTURES in LOWER Torsion Link"", makes a proper interpretation difficult; that could induce errors to choose the corresponding AMM Task and determine its scope.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIAA Report number: CIAA-ACCID-005-2017 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: CORPAC  El Comercio  portaldeturismo.pe   Location  Images: photo (c) AAIB; 28 March 2017 photo (c) Aeroprints.com; Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KUL/WMKK); 02 December 2004 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft originated from Leeds/Bradford Airport, U.K. at 08:13 UTC (09:13 LT). The crew consisted of the line supervising captain, the copilot and a line training captain, sitting in the observation seat, to evaluate the copilot for his completion of line training. The copilot was the aircraft's pilot flying (PF) during the whole route. The flight went smoothly and the crew carried out the final ILS Z approach manoeuvre for runway 10 at the Alicante-Elche Airport maintaining stabilized approach parameters as described in the operator's manual. Nine seconds after starting the landing flare manoeuvre, touchdown was made with a pitch attitude of 5Â°, a calibrated speed of 119 kt and a vertical descent speed of 240 fpm. There was a vertical acceleration of 1.45 G corresponding to a firm impact. The flare manoeuvre was considered slow, which the manufacturer identifies as a risk factor for tail strike. The position of the control column was slackened slightly after touchdown was made, but the pitch attitude tendency continued to increase until it reached a value of 10.2Â°, reaching a 1.14 G vertical acceleration value. This attitude was maintained for one second, causing the rear of the aircraft to strike the runway surface. After the tail area had struck the runway, the captain took control of the aircraft and continued the landing manoeuvre, completing it without any additional problems. The flight crew were unaware that the aircraft's tail area had touched the runway until they were informed at the parking area by one of the cabin crew that they had heard an unusual noise when landing. The aircraft suffered damage to the lower part of the tail cone. All the people on board disembarked normally without any medical attention being required. Causes / Contributing factors: The investigation has determined that the cause of the accident was incorrect pitch position control during landing. As a contributing factor, the fact that the aircraft captain (PM) could have intervened before the accident to correct the situation is highlighted.METAR: 10:00 UTC / 12:00 local time: LEAL 101000Z 09006KT 050V150 9999 FEW020 18/10 Q1026 NOSIG11:00 UTC / 13:00 local time: LEAL 101100Z 09006KT 050V150 9999 FEW020 18/10 Q1026 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIAIAC Report number: A-003/2017 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: CIAIAC   Location  Images: photo (c) Leslie Snelleman; Palma de Mallorca Airport (PMI/LEPA); 30 August 2015 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

A few seconds after taking off from runway 33, the landing gear lever was selected to the Up position. About 20 seconds later, the crew discovered that the landing gear had not retracted. The landing gear remained in the Down & Locked position because the landing gear safety pins were set. The crew suspected that the safety pins were still set and decided to land back at Salzburg Airport, which was carried out on runway 15. After a flight time of about 5 minutes, the aircraft left the runway at about 10:17 on taxiway E. They were instructed by the control tower to taxi back to the parking area (apron).  The aircraft was stopped shortly after taxiing on taxiway E, as the crew noticed an increased rolling resistance of the aircraft, whereby the crew suspected a burst tyre. The crew decided to check directly at the taxiway whether the safety pins were still on the landing gear, to remove them if necessary and to check whether a tire was defective. The control tower of Salzburg Airport was not informed about this by the pilots. The co-pilot opened the cabin door and left the aircraft to perform these checks. Meanwhile, the pilot left the cockpit to inform the passengers in the cabin of the situation. At 10:20 and 10:22, the Salzburg Tower controller tried without success to make contact with the aircraft's crew. An aircraft passing taxiway L informed the controller about a person on the taxiway who had left the aircraft in question. The co-pilot, who had gone to the landing gear, recognized that the safety pins were installed and tried to remove them. When this attempt failed because hydraulic pressure was applied to the landing gear cylinder and the safety pin was jammed, he operated the landing gear door control valves of the nose and main landing gear several times and installed the landing gear doors control valve pins. This closed the landing gear doors, the main cylinders of the hydraulics of the main and nose landing gear were depressurized and the safety pins could be removed. After the co-pilot removed the nose landing gear door pin, the nose landing gear doors opened and the nose landing gear folded at about 10:30. The aircraft nose lowered and hit the taxiway. 5 to 10 seconds later the engines were switched off. No indication could be found that both the Landing Gear Failure to Retract and the Attempted Landing Gear Retraction with Safety Pins Installed Checklist were executed from the time the installed Safety Pins were detected until the time of the accident. Probable causes - Incomplete execution of the Preflight Checklist, thus forgetting the safety pins installed in the landing gears. - No knowledge or execution of the checklists for Landing Gear Failure to Retract or the Attempted Landing Gear Retraction with Safety Pins Installed. Thus, incorrect operation of the landing gear system and, as a result, failure to properly reset the landing gear to a defined system state. Probable Factors - Lack of ""REMOVE BEFORE FLIGHT"" flags on landing gear safety pins. Consequently, more difficult to detect deployed fuse pins.  - Collusion between pilots on the insertion or non-insertion of the securing pins, although insertion is mandatory by the manufacturer for parking and towing. - Very extensive Exterior Preflight Inspection Checklist for daily flight operations with 136 inspection points, which tempts to simplify the checklist for daily operations to a few important inspection points, which is not permissible from a safety, operational and certification point of view. - Gradual increase in psychological stress, characterized by communication difficulties, lack of knowledge of systems and procedures, time pressure and psychophysiological stress. - Breaking the logic of landing gear system operation for pilots because despite 3 green downlock indicators and landing gear lever in DOWN position on a GIV-X (G450), the landing gear can retract on the ground due to incorrect and improper operation of the landing gear system. The selector valve of the landing gear thus remained in a position not directly visible to the pilots.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: UUS Austria Report number: BMVIT-85.245 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) Rudolf Schider; Salzburg-W.

Correia International Airport for Mahdia Airstrip. The aircraft was programmed to do a series of shuttles to various airstrips in the Region 8 area. The accident flight was the second shuttle between Mahdia and Kopinang. The previous flight was normal. For the second shuttle, the aircraft was loaded with one passenger and cargo for a flight to Kopinang Airstrip. The aircraft departed Mahdia at 11:12 hrs local time with an estimated flying time of 24 minutes. As the aircraft approached Kopinang, rain was observed over the airstrip. This caused the pilot to hold for about 10-15 minutes East of the field to allow the rain to pass. The aircraft landed, but during the landing roll the wheels locked up. The brakes were modulated, and the flaps were raised but the aircraft did not stop. The pilot then moved the mixture controls to shutoff and steered the aircraft left towards a playfield. This was occupied and he turned the aircraft right, into a construction site that was located off the end of the usable portion of the runway. The aircraft stopped in the construction area. The right hand main landing gear broke off and the nose landing gear was bent. Cause: This accident was caused because the aircraft could not be stopped, after landing, within the usable portion of the runway. Contributory Factors: 1. The decision to land, without making a proper assessment of the runway conditions. 2. The wetness of the runway, which prevented effective braking.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: GCAA-AIT Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: demerarawaves.com  stabroeknews.com History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  29 January 2015 8R-GAR Air Services Limited 0 Kurupung Airport, Region 7 min Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

On board the aircraft was one pilot, 1,225 kg of general cargo and 800 lbs of fuel. At 11:44 hours local time, in daylight conditions, the aircraft departed Tanahmerah and cruised at altitude of 7,000 feet. Estimate time arrival at Oksibil would be 12:24. At 12:12, when the aircraft position was about 45 NM north of Tanahmerah, the aircraft passed another Cessna 208B aircraft from the opposite direction from Oksibil to Tanahmerah. The Cessna 208B pilot advised to the pilot via radio that the PK-FSO aircraft was in sight. The pilot responded that the aircraft was maintaining 7,000 feet on direct route to Oksibil. The pilot failed to contact the Oksibil air traffic controller and failed to arrive at the destination. The airline's flight following officer received an emergency signal with a last recorded position of 6 NM north of Oksibil.  The next day the aircraft was found on a ridge of Anem Mountain at a height of 7100 feet. The aircraft was destroyed by impact forces and the pilot was fatally injured. The investigation learned that two days prior the occurrence, the pilot travelled on a night commercial flight. This might have resulted in a sleep disturbance during the window of circadian low and an increase of the potential of fatigue. There are indications that the pilot did not have the required adequate restorative sleep before he started flying on the accident day. Prior to the occurrence flight, the pilot had flown for 3 flight sectors, with total flight hour of 2 hours 55 minutes. The multiple take-offs and landings that day increased fatigue.  Based on the final flight track, the absence of voice communication, the weather condition permitting the pilot to identify the airport location and the aircraft wreckage, consistently indicated that there were no pilot activities to fly the aircraft after the last known pilot activities at about 29 Nm from Oksibil until impact. Colleagues of the pilot reported that he often smoked in the cockpit during the flight, looked sleepy and engaged the Terrain Inhibit switch which disabled the GA-EGPWS function while flying. This prevented any prior warning when the aircraft neared Anem Mountain. This known behavior was not reported to the Operation and Safety department, so no action could be taken.

The flight was cleared for approach and landing on runway 13.  In the final approach and landing phase moderate wind shear and moderate turbulence were encountered. The left crosswind and the tail wind encountered did not exceed the limits of the aircraft. After touchdown the aircraft veered off the left side of the runway and hit a barrier on one side of the runway nose-first, damaging its nose, left engine and wing. Findings related to probable causes: 1. The occurrence aircraft performed the final approach in left crosswind and landed with its nose yawing to the left. It was probably  affected by the clockwise horizontal wind shear on the runway and pilot's operation, the aircraft began drifting to the left after touching down. 2. As the aircraft was drifting to the left, the Captain had used right rudder to correct the deviation, and also pulled the power levers into the reverse range. According to the recorded engine data of torque and (reverse) power of both engines, it revealed that the Captain inadvertently pulled back the left power lever while he was intending to apply the right-turning differential power to assist him in correcting the left drift. It resulted in increasing the left reverse power and intensified the aircraftÂs left drifting tendency. 3. Though the Captain attempted to get the directional control of aircraft by increasing the right rudder input and the right wheel brake pressure, however he still kept increasing the reverse power of left engine to the maximum, not knowing that he was taking the wrong side. Consequently, the aircraft veered off the runway, hit the fence and caused aircraft substantial damage.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ASC Report number: ASC-AOR-18-03-002 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Focus Taiwan  ASC   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane was being operated as Flight 341 by Grant Aviation as a scheduled commuter flight. The pilot, the sole occupant, sustained fatal injuries. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the airplane's point of departure. Flight 341 departed Port Heiden Airport, Alaska, at 13:05, destined for Perryville Airport, Perryville, Alaska. Flight 341 originated at the King Salmon Airport, Alaska, with one passenger who disembarked at the Port Heiden Airport. The scheduled flight continued to the Perryville Airport, which was about 80 miles away, with 1,322 lbs. of mail and no passengers.  After an ELT signal of the aircraft was received, a search mission was initiated. At 17:30, the wreckage was located. The wreckage came to rest in deep snow at about 2,993 feet on the west face of a treeless, steep mountain in the Alaska Peninsula National Wildlife Refuge of the Aleutian Range. It is located about 500 feet from the top of the mountain ridge and partially submerged in the snow on its left side with the nose section under the snow pack.

The flight was a regularly scheduled flight from Boston Logan Airport (BOS), Boston, Massachusetts, to the John F Kennedy International Airport (JFK), New York, New York.  There were no other injuries, and no damage to the airplane.  According to the flight attendant statements, the #3 flight attendant (FA) stated that because the ride was ""slightly bumpy,"" she remained seated for an additional 5 to 10 minutes after the cabin received the double chime indicating that the flight had passed 10,000 feet.  Once it seemed to have smoothed out, she stood up and began to prepare for cabin service. Shortly after standing up, the airplane shook violently and she was tossed off her feet and into the air and landed on her right ankle, ending up on the galley floor.  According to the flight crew statements, they had just completed a flight into BOS on a different airplane with nothing more than light turbulence on descent. Prior to the accident flight, the captain briefed the #1 FA that they had just flown in and didn't expect anything worse than light turbulence during climb out.  During climb out, the flight crew indicted they were in and out of the clouds and only experience light chop. The weather radar was on but ""was not painting anything."" Just prior to leveling off at 14,000 feet they encountered a strong jolt of turbulence and then received a call from the cabin about the #3 flight attendant injury. At the time of the turbulence, the fasten seatbelt sign was illuminated. The injured FA was assisted into a rear customer seat for the remainder of the flight with her foot elevated and ice applied. Because the injured FA was incapacitated, the #2 FA crewed the #3 FA position and a nonrevenue FA crewed the #2 FA position. The flight was met by emergency medical personnel and the FA was transported to a local hospital where she was diagnosed with a broken right ankle. Probable Cause: an inadvertent encounter with convective turbulence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA17CA111 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates15-Mar-2018 20:12 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

Both crew members suffered fatal injuries. The aircraft originated from Louisville International Airport, Kentucky at 05:41 hours.  As the flight neared Yeager Airport at an altitude of 9000 ft, the crew received the most recent ATIS report for the airport indicating wind from 080Â° at 11 knots, 10 miles visibility, scattered clouds at 700 ft agl, and a broken ceiling at 1300 ft agl. However, a special weather observation recorded about 7 minutes before the flight crew's initial contact with the approach controller indicated that the wind conditions had changed to 170Â° at 4 knots and that cloud ceilings had dropped to 500 ft agl. The approach controller did not provide the updated weather information to the flight crew and did not update the ATIS. The approach controller advised the flight crew to expect the localizer 5 approach, which would have provided a straight-in final approach course aligned with runway 5. The first officer acknowledged the instruction but requested the VOR-A circling instrument approach, presumably because the approach procedure happened to line up with the flight crew's inbound flightpath and flying the localizer 5 approach would result in a slightly longer flight to the airport.  However, because the localizer 5 approach was available, the flight crew's decision to fly the VOR-A circling approach was contrary to the operator's standard operating procedures (SOP). The minimum descent altitude (MDA) for the localizer approach was 373 ft agl, and the MDA for the VOR-A approach was about 773 ft agl. With the special weather observation indicating cloud cover at 500 ft agl, it would be difficult for the pilots to see the airport while at the MDA for the VOR-A approach; yet, the flight crew did not have that information. The approach controller was required to provide the flight crew with the special weather report indicating that the ceiling at the arrival airport had dropped below the MDA, which could have prompted the pilots to use the localizer approach; however, the pilots would not have been required to because the minimum visibility for the VOR-A approach was within acceptable limits. The approach controller approved the first officer's request then cleared the flight direct to the first waypoint of the VOR-A approach and to descend to 4000 ft. Radar data indicated that as the flight progressed along the VOR-A approach course, the airplane descended 120 feet below the prescribed minimum stepdown altitude of 1720 ft two miles prior to FOGAG waypoint. The airplane remained level at or about 1600 ft until about 0.5 mile from the displaced threshold of the landing runway. At this point, the airplane entered a 2500 ft-per-minute, turning descent toward the runway in a steep left bank up to 42Â° in an apparent attempt to line up with the runway. Performance analysis indicates that, just before the airplane impacted the runway, the descent rate decreased to about 600 fpm and pitch began to move in a nose-up direction, suggesting that the captain was pulling up as the airplane neared the pavement; however, it was too late to save the approach.  At 06:50, the airplane impacted the runway 5 centerline in a 22Â° left bank and 5Â° nose-down at an airspeed of about 92 knots. The airplane's left wingtip struck the pavement first, followed by the left main landing gear and left propeller. The fuselage impacted the pavement and the left wing separated from the airplane during the impact sequence. The airplane slid off the left side of the runway through the grass safety area and down a hill through trees, coming to rest about 380 feet left of the runway centerline and 85 ft below the runway elevation. Video and witness information were not conclusive as to whether the captain descended below the MDA before exiting the cloud cover; however, the descent from the MDA was not in accordance with federal regulations, which required, in part, that pilots not leave the MDA until the ""aircraft is continuously in a position from which a descent to a landing on the intended runway can be made at a normal descent rate using normal maneuvers."" The accident airplane's descent rate was not in accordance with company guidance, which stated that ""a constant rate of descent of about 500 ft./min. should be maintained."" Rather than continue the VOR-A approach with an excessive descent rate and airplane maneuvering, the captain should have conducted a missed approach and executed the localizer 5 approach procedure. No evidence was found to indicate why the captain chose to continue the approach; however, the captain's recent performance history, including an unsatisfactory checkride due to poor instrument flying, indicated that his instrument flight skills were marginal. It is possible that the captain felt more confident in his ability to perform an unstable approach to the runway compared to conducting the circling approach to land. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The flight crew's improper decision to conduct a circling approach contrary to the operator's standard operating procedures (SOP) and the captain's excessive descent rate and maneuvering during the approach, which led to inadvertent, uncontrolled contact with the ground. Contributing to the accident was the operator's lack of a formal safety and oversight program to assess hazards and compliance with SOPs and to monitor pilots with previous performance issues.""METAR: 10:30 UTC / 06:30 local time: KCRW 051030Z 17004KT 10SM FEW001 OVC005 14/13 A2940 RMK AO2 VLY FG T01390133 $10:54 UTC / 06:54 local time: KCRW 051054Z 23003KT 10SM FEW001 OVC005 14/13 A2941 RMK AO2 SLP952 VLY FG T0144013310:59 UTC / 06:59 local time: KCRW 051059Z COR 00000KT 10SM FEW001 OVC005 14/13 A2940 RMK AO2 VLY FG T01440133Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA17FA109 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: tristateupdate.com  flightaware.com   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Charleston-Yeager Airport, WV (CRW); 06 May 2017; (CC:by-nc-sa) photo (c) NTSB; Charleston-Yeager Airport, WV (CRW); 06 May 2017; (CC:by-nc-sa) photo (c) NTSB; Charleston-Yeager Airport, WV (CRW); 06 May 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Charleston-Yeager Airport, WV (CRW); 06 May 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Charleston-Yeager Airport, WV (CRW); 06 May 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Charleston-Yeager Airport, WV (CRW); May 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Charleston-Yeager Airport, WV (CRW); May 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Charleston-Yeager Airport, WV (CRW); May 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Charleston-Yeager Airport, WV (CRW); 05 May 2017 photo (c) NTSB; Charleston-Yeager Airport, WV (CRW); 05 May 2017 photo (c) NTSB; Charleston-Yeager Airport, WV (CRW); 05 May 2017 photo (c) Leslie Snelleman; East Midlands Airport (EMA/EGNX); 17 April 1983 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Both crew members suffered fatal injuries. The flight departed from the Philadelphia International Airport, Pennsylvania, about 15:04 on a repositioning flight destined for Teterboro (TEB). The crew filed a flight plan for the accident flight that included altitude (27,000 ft) and time en route (28 minutes) entries that were incompatible with each other, which suggests that the crew devoted little attention to preflight planning. The crew also had limited time in flight to plan and brief the approach, as required by company policy, and did not conduct an approach briefing before attempting to land at TEB. Cockpit voice recorder data indicated that the  second-in-command (SIC) was the pilot flying (PF) from PHL to TEB, despite a company policy prohibiting the SIC from acting as PF based on his level of experience. Although the accident flight was likely not the first time that the SIC acted as PF, based on comments made during the flight. The PIC regularly coached the SIC from before takeoff to the final seconds of the flight. The extensive coaching likely distracted the PIC from his duties as PIC and pilot monitoring, such as executing checklists and entering approach waypoints into the flight management system. Collectively, procedural deviations and errors resulted in the flight crewÂs lack of situational awareness throughout the flight and approach to TEB. Because neither pilot realized that the airplaneÂs navigation equipment had not been properly set for the instrument approach clearance that the flight crew received, the crew improperly executed the vertical profile of the approach, crossing an intermediate fix and the final approach fix hundreds of feet above the altitudes specified by the approach procedure. The controller had vectored the flight for the instrument landing system runway 6 approach, circle to runway 1. When the crew initiated the circle-to-land maneuver, the airplane was 2.8 nautical miles (nm) beyond the final approach fix (about 1 mile from the runway 6 threshold) and could not be maneuvered to line up with the landing runway, which should have prompted the crew to execute a go-around because the flight did not meet the companyÂs stabilized approach criteria. However, neither pilot called for a go-around. The PIC, who had assumed control of the airplane at this point in the flight, continued the approach by initiating a turn to align with the landing runway. Radar data indicated that the airplaneÂs airspeed was below the approach speed required by company standard operating procedures (SOP). During the turn, the airplane stalled and impacted the ground in a right wing low and nose down attitude in an industrial area between Kero Road and Commerce Road in Carlstadt, New Jersey, 1000 m short of runway 01. A fire erupted and consumed the aircraft. Both crew members died in the accident. Probable Cause: ""The NTSB determines that the probable cause of this accident was the PICÂs attempt to salvage an unstabilized visual approach, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall at low altitude. Contributing to the accident was the PICÂs decision to allow an unapproved SIC to act as PF, the PICÂs inadequate and incomplete preflight planning, and the flight crewÂs lack of an approach briefing. Also contributing to the accident were Trans-PacificÂs lack of safety programs that would have enabled the company to identify and correct patterns of poor performance and procedural noncompliance and the FAAÂs ineffective SAS procedures, which failed to identify these company oversight deficiencies.""METAR: 14:52 UTC / 18:52 local time: KTEB 151852Z 35020G30KT 10SM SCT045 19/06 A297515:45 UTC / 19:45 local time: KTEB 151945Z 32015G32KT 10SM SCT045 19/04 A2975 RMK SMOKE ON APCHAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NTSB/AAR-19/02 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Flightaware  NBC  FAA  NorthJersey.com  Teterboro Learjet Crash Raises Questions about Crew Qualifications (Flying.com, 13 Feb 2018)   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Teterboro Airport, NJ (TEB); 15 May 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Teterboro Airport, NJ (TEB); 15 May 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) Google Earth, with ASN annotations; Teterboro Airport, NJ (TEB); 15 May 2017 photo (c) NTSB; Teterboro Airport, NJ (TEB); 15 May 2017 photo (c) NTSB; Teterboro Airport, NJ (TEB); 15 May 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) Paul Kanagie; Philadelphia International Airport, PA (PHL/KPHL); 15 May 2017 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Of the 146 passengers and crew onboard, one flight attendant received serious injuries.Â  The airplane was notÂ damaged.Â The regularly scheduled passenger flight was operating under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 from Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport (KMSY), New Orleans, Louisiana, to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (KDFW), Dallas, Texas. During cruise, as the flight was approaching a line of weather, the flight crew made a public address announcement for the passengers to be seated because they expected turbulence.Â  In addition, the captain called the lead flight attendant (FA) and instructed that all the flight attendants be seated. The seatbelt sign was illuminated for the entire flight. About 10 minutes later, the flight penetrated a line of weather and the airplane had a short encounter with moderate turbulence. The autopilot did not disengage during the encounter. When the turbulence occurred, one of the FAs was seated inÂ the aft galley without her seatbelt fastened and was thrownÂ upwards, hitting her head on the ceiling before landing on the galley floor. She was assisted by medically qualified passengers and remained on the floor for the remainder of the flight due to numbness in her extremities.  Emergency personnel met the airplane after landing and the injured FA was transported to the hospital where she was diagnosed with number 1 lumbar fracture. Probable Cause: an encounter with convective turbulence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA17CA123 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA17CA123  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

The aircraft originated from the Conrad Maldives Rangali Island Resort at 08:08 hours local time. The co-pilot was Pilot Flying. The flight and approach to MalÃ© were uneventful. While landing the left float touched the water first, then the aircraft bounced and ballooned. It then landed on the left float for a second time, and bounced again. Then the aircraft was banking excessively to the right digging the right wing tip in the water, making the aircraft veer to the right. Then the aircraft crashed on water banking to the left with the left float digging into the water. After the accident the aircraft came to rest with the left hand wing touching the water with an apparently collapsed left hand float attachment. Causes: a. Improper recovery techniques from a bounced landing; application of go-around procedures whilst the aircraft was at low speed with flaps fully extended. b.

The aircraft operated on a cargo charter flight with 1680 kg cargo on board. It took off from Kathmandu at 07:44 UTC at flight 409, bound for Lukla. It was the 5th flight of the aircraft to Lukla and with the same set of crew. Lukla weather was cloudy, but visibility and ceiling was reported to be fine after an hour of heavy rain. On first contact flight 409 reported abeam Rumjatar descending out of 11300 ft at 08:10 UTC. Lukla Tower provided the latest weather at the airport, as well as enroute weather relayed by 9N-AGU, an AS350 helicopter that had departed Lukla for Kathmandu. Almost 4 minutes after the first contact, Tower informed flight 409 about the deteriorating weather. The right base leg was covered by lifting fog though there was no rain and the final approach area was still visible. Weather deteriorated further and Tower regularly updated the flight crew. About 30 seconds after flight 409 reported entering valley, Lukla Tower again informed about the latest status of the further deteriorating weather. Flight 409 then informed that they would come up to Bhatkeko Daada and then decide. The pilot also informed they could see some bright spots. While continuing approach, both cockpit crew sighted the runway at 9100 ft. That was 64 seconds before the impact. While continuing approach the aircraft deviated to the right by almost 15 degrees and erroneously descended too low to 8500 ft whereas threshold height is 8900 ft (on Kathmandu QNH, whereas per AIP it is 9200 ft).  The flight crew attempted to climb and reach the threshold in a landing configuration. The aircraft pitched up to over 25Â°, the airspeed dropped and the aircraft stalled. Subsequently its left wing first hit a small tree and then impacted the sloping terrain 130 feet short of the runway. The captain and copilot both sustained fatal injuries. Probable Cause:  The Commission concludes that the probable cause of this accident was aircraft stall as a result of excessive drag created by sudden increase in angle of attack of the aircraft supplemented by low speed (below Vref) in an attempt to initiate immediate climb on a landing configuration (full flap and landing gear down) warranted by the critical situation of the final phase of flight. The contributing factors for the accident are: a. Critical terrain and rapidly deteriorating weather condition. b. Pilot's loss of situational awareness c. Improper pilot response to stall warning including failure to advance power lever to maximum at appropriate time. d. Voilation of SOP by the ATS and Pilot as well.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Nepal AAIC Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Kathmandu Post  Hemant Arjyal  My Republica  The Himalayan Times History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  2 June 2015 9N-AKY Goma Air 0 Pokhara Airport (VNPK), Pokhara, Kaski, Gandaki min Location  Images: photo (c) Eckhard SchlÃ¶der; Lukla-Tenzing-Hillary Airport (LUA); 04 January 2017 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

At 03:15 UTC, while descending from FL270, the pilot established communication with Ambon Approach Control, and the flight received clearance to descend to 15,000 feet and to proceed to point AUDRI and hold for separation with an aircraft that would depart from runway 22. When the aircraft left AUDRI, the approach controller informed that the weather was deteriorating and the visibility was about 1,000 up to 1,500 meters. The pilot reported was established on the ILS and the approach controller instructed to report when runway in sight. At an altitude of approximately 1,000 feet the pilot reported runway in sight and received landing clearance. Thereafter the pilot selected the flaps to full down, wipers ON and decided to continue landing. While on final, the pilot requested the maximum runway light intensity and the tower controller reported that it was on maximum intensity. Prior to touch down on the runway, the pilot reduced the power lever gradually and felt the aircraft touched down and bounced.

The flight was uneventful since the first departure from Makassar until commencing the approach at Manokwari. At 08:15 hours local time, the aircraft departed Sorong to Manokwari. On board were two pilots, four flight attendants and 146 passengers. On this flight, the Second in Command (SIC) acted as Pilot Flying (PF) and the Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as Pilot Monitoring (PM). At 08:31, the pilot made first contact with the Rendani Tower controller and informed that the aircraft was descending from FL230 and requested weather information. The Rendani Tower controller informed the pilot that the wind was calm, ground visibility 6 km, cloud FEW CB 1,400 feet, temperature and dew point 26/25Â°C. At 08:36, Rendani Tower instructed to the pilot to descend to 11,000 feet and to report when on Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC). At 08:38, the pilot informed that they were in VMC and passing altitude 13,000 feet at 32 NM from the ZQ NDB (Non-Directional Beacon). The Rendani Tower controller instructed to fly overhead, descend to circuit altitude, join right downwind runway 35, and to report when overhead Manokwari. At 08:44, the pilot reported that the aircraft was over Manokwari and the Tower controller informed the pilot that the visibility had changed to 5 km. Two minutes later Rendani Tower instructed the pilot to continue approach and to report on right base runway 35. At 08:49, at approximately 600 feet, the PIC as PM took over control by called ""I have control"" and the SIC replied ""You have control"". A few seconds later the pilot reported that the aircraft was on final runway 35, and Rendani Tower instructed to the pilot to report when the runway 35 in sight. The pilot immediately replied that the runway was in sight, which was acknowledged by Rendani Tower who then issued landing clearance with additional information that the wind was calm and the runway condition wet. At approximately 550 feet, the PIC instructed the SIC turn on the wiper and reconfirmed to SIC that the runway was in sight. Between altitude 500 feet to 200 feet, the EGPWS aural warnings ""Sink Rate"" and ""Pull Up"" sounded. At 08:50, the aircraft touched down on runway 35. The spoilers deployed and the pilot activated the thrust reversers. The crew did not feel significant deceleration. The aircraft failed to stop on the runway and overran by approximately 20 meters from the end of runway pavement. After the aircraft stopped, the PIC commanded ""Evacuate"" through the Passenger Address (PA) system. The Rendani Tower Controller saw that the aircraft had overrun, activated the crash bell and then informed the Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) that there was an aircraft overrun after landing on runway 35. All the flight crew and passengers evacuated the aircraft and transported to the terminal building safely. The aircraft sustained serious damage on the nose landing gear, nose section lower fuselage, and both engine fan blades.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSC Report number: KNKT.17.05.17.04 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: Celebes Online  Antara History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  18 April 2008 PK-CJC Sriwijaya Air 0 Pangkalpinang Airport (PGK/WIPK) min Runway excursion Location  Images: photo (c) NTSC; Manokwari-Rendani Airport (MKW); 31 May 2017 photo (c) NTSC; Manokwari-Rendani Airport (MKW); 31 May 2017 photo (c) NTSC; Manokwari-Rendani Airport (MKW); 31 May 2017 photo (c) NTSC; Manokwari-Rendani Airport (MKW); 31 May 2017 photo (c) NTSC; Manokwari-Rendani Airport (MKW); 31 May 2017 photo (c) Muhamad Gabriel Miolo; Bandar Lampung-Branti Airport (TKG/WICT); 22 April 2017 photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Jakarta-Soekarno-Hatta International Airport (CGK/WIII); 14 April 2014 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The ten occupants were not injured, but the aircraft was substantially damaged. The aircraft was on a sales trip to Mongolia at the time of the accident. Eight passengers were due to be taken on a flight out of Ulan Bator. The aircraft was fueled with 950 kg of fuel. Flaps were set at 20Â°, according to the crew, and the aircraft was cleared for takeoff from runway 32. After lifting off the runway, the aircraft went into an immediate climb and flaps were retracted at an altitude of 40-50 m. Shortly afterwards the aircraft pitched up and entered a right bank with increasing roll rate. The aircraft lost altitude and impacted terrain between the runway and the taxiway. The right main gear and lower and upper right wings impacted the ground first, causing the undercarriage and wings to collapse.  The TVS-2MS was an Antonov 2T that was converted in 2013 with a TPE331 turbine engine instead of the original Shvetzov ASH-62IR radial piston engine. Conclusion: The aircraft accident with UEMOB RA-2099G took place because of its entering the stall mode during takeoff with the values of weight and alignment exceeding the established limits. The actual value of alignment at takeoff was 37% with a 33% limit.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: MAK   Location  Images: photo (c) MAK; Ulan Bator-Chinggis Khaan International Airport (ULN); 02 June 2017 photo (c) Aleksandr Markin; 10 June 2014 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

During the landing rollout, the aircraft overshot the end of the runway, eventually hitting a rainwater drainage ditch located approximately 70 meters from the threshold. The aircraft had substantial damage. The two pilots and three passengers were unharmed. Contributing factors. - Application of commands - contributed. Flight controls were not adequately used to correct the variations presented during final to landing, leading to increased speed and long touchdown on the runway. - Cabin coordination - undetermined. It is possible that the aircraft weight for landing and Vref were not part of the descent/approach briefing as per the company's Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), having the potential to generate information conflicts on board the aircraft. - Airport infrastructure - contributed. The aircraft crashed into a masonry drainage ditch for rainwater located in the Runway End Safety Area (RESA). This area was supposed to be clean and level and provide safety for aircraft operating at the airfield if one of them touched down before reaching the headland or accidentally overshot the end of the runway. - Pilotage Judgment - contributed. It was considered that, despite being on a non-stabilized approach, a safe landing would be possible. Likewise, the distance required for landing in the conditions that presented themselves was not taken into consideration. - Perception - contributed. The landing in disagreement with the predicted parameters for a stabilized approach denoted a low level of crew situational awareness of factors that could affect the execution of the task and compromise flight safety. The night VFR flight in a mountainous area and with few light references on the ground may have contributed to a reduced perception of the final approach parameters. - Decision making - contributed. The landing, despite the non-stabilized approach and the possibility of a go-around, was based on an inadequate assessment of the existing conditions, contributing to the accident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CENIPA Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: CENIPA  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates15-Sep-2020 08:15 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, which operated on an instrument rules flight plan. The flight originated from Tucson International Airport, Arizona at 15:32. The pilot reported that, during the approach to Scottsdale, the nose landing gear light was red, which indicated that it was not down and locked. In order to assess the situation, the pilot exited the traffic pattern, and referred to the emergency checklist. After using the hand pump to lower the landing gear manually, the red light still indicated that the gear was up. The pilot asked the tower for a landing gear check and the tower replied that it appeared it was down and straight. The pilot executed a normal landing, and as the airplane started to slow down, about 35-40 knots, the nose gear collapsed.

Three crew members and six passengers were on board the airplane. At 07:20 UTC the airplane reached cruise level FL340. After entering Indian airspace (Mumbai FIR) the aircraft was cleared to fly to reporting point KITAL via route L894. At approximately 08:18 UTC the co-pilot radioed reaching reporting point GOLEM. At 06:55 UTC an Airbus A380-861 (A6-EUL) had taken off at Dubai Airport, United Arab Emirates, for flight EK412 to Sydney, Australia. The aircraft flew at FL350 with a southern heading. At 08:38:07 UTC the A380 had passed the Challenger overhead with a vertical distance of 1,000 ft. At 08:38:54 UTC the Challenger, with engaged autopilot, began to slightly roll right. At the same time a counter-rotating aileron deflection was recorded and fluctuation of the vertical acceleration began.  In the subsequent approximately 10 seconds the airplane had a right bank angle of 4Â° to 6Â°. At 08:39:03 UTC the right bank angle began to increase. Within one second the bank angle increased to 42Â° to the right. At the same time the aileron deflection to the left increased to 20Â° and the vertical acceleration to 1.6 g. In the following second vertical acceleration changed to -3.2 g. At 08:39:04 UTC a lateral acceleration of 0.45 g to the right was recorded. The pitch angle changed from about 3Â° to about 1Â°, then within one second increased to 9Â° and decreased again in the following second to -20Â°. At the same time the FDR recorded a rudder deflection to the left reaching 11.2Â° after about two seconds whereas the bank angle changed from 42Â° right to 31Â° left. Between 08:39:05 UTC and 08:39:10 UTC Indicated Airspeed (in knots) changed from approximately 277 KIAS to 248 KIAS. The N1 of the left engine of 95% began to decrease. The lateral acceleration then reached 0.94 g left, the autopilot disengaged, and a master warning, lasting seven seconds, was recorded. Both pilots had actuated the aileron to the right in order to stop the rolling motion. But the airplane had continued to roll to the left thereby completing several rotations. Subsequently both Inertial Reference Systems (IRS), the Flight Management System (FMS), and the attitude indication failed. Between 08:39:09 UTC and 08:39:41 UTC the FDR recorded a loss of altitude of approximately 8,700 ft. Large control surface deflections and acceleration were recorded. The speed increased and at 08:39:31 UTC reached approximately 330 KIAS. At 08:39:30 UTC the spoilers extended and 13 seconds later were retracted again. The N1 of the left engine had decreased to approximately 40% when the Interstage Turbine Temperature (ITT) began to increase and nine seconds later had reached 850Â°. The left engine was shut off. At about 08:56 UTC the Pilot in Command (PIC) informed the air traffic controller in Mumbai of the occurrence, declared emergency, and reported their position, altitude and their intention to fly via KITAL to Oman. At about 09:15 UTC the crew restarted the left engine. Subsequently the airplane climbed to FL250. At about 09:56 UTC the autopilot was re-engaged. At 11:05 UTC the Challenger landed at Muscat Airport. The A380 continued the flight to Sydney and landed there at 19:58 UTC. The aircraft manufacturer determined that the Challenger's airframe structure could not be restored to an airworthy state as it exceeded the airframe certification design load limits during the upset encounter.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BFU Report number: BFU17-0024-2X Status: Preliminary reportDuration: 4 monthsDownload report:  Preliminary report Sources: Oman Observer  atheer.com  PPRuNe   Location  Images: photo (c) BFU/Google Earth; over Arabian Sea; 07 January 2017 photo (c) BFU; over Arabian Sea; 07 January 2017 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The crew had planned a shortest possible ground stop before flying to Torp Sandefjord Airport. The captain flew the aircraft (PF), while the First Officer monitored the flying (PM). During the ground stop at Gardermoen, only one engine was stopped while the First Officer completed an external inspection of the aircraft He did not observe any ice or anything out of the ordinary on the areas of the aircraft that could be inspected. There were icing conditions at Gardermoen and in the airspace above the airport. After flying from Switzerland for more than two hours in approximately minus 50Â°C, the aircraft's surfaces (fuselage and wings) were more than likely chilled. When the crew requested taxi clearance, they were assigned a different runway than expected. This entailed a longer taxi time and thus longer exposure to the prevailing weather conditions. The aircraft's ground stop lasted approximately 15 minutes at an air temperature of 0Â°C. The taxiways and runway were covered with 3-6 mm of slush and it was snowing when the aircraft took off. Initially, the take-off proceeded as normal. The landing gear was retracted and both pilots observed that the speed was rapidly approaching 200 kt, which is the maximum speed with flaps deployed. As the flaps were retracted, the crew experienced a violent nose-down movement and the pilots were ""hanging by their seat belts"", while the aircraft started sharply banking to the left. The aircraft at this moment experienced negative 2.62 G. The captain did not trust the instruments while the First Officer had better situational awareness. The First Officer quickly took control and started a pull-out from the dive. The aircraft descended below the cloud base, and even though it was dark, the pilots could glimpse the ground. Control was regained and the aircraft levelled off 170 ft above the ground. The aircraft was overstressed to 5.99 G during the pull-out. The crew called ""MAYDAY"" to the Air Traffic Control. Once control was regained, the ""MAYDAY"" was cancelled and the flight continued towards Torp where an approach and landing took place without further problems. The aircraft was overstressed well above Ultimate Load Factor (-2.16 to +5.40 G) and considered not to be economically viable to repair. Primary conclusion: 1. The probable explanation for the aircraft suddenly diving, is that the tailplane stalled. AIBN has not found other explanations for this than slush spray from the runway and falling snow and sleet settled on the tailplane's leading edge and underside during taxi and take-off. This contamination is presumed to have frozen to ice. 2. The aircraft's anti and de-icing systems on the wings and tailplane were switched on, but the tailplane de-icing system had completed a ""cycle"" before take-off and was in rest mode during take-off. In the assessment by AIBN, the aircraft's anti- and de-icing systems were not suitable to remove the type of ice and snow that had most likely settled on the aircraft's tailplane. The aircraft should have been de-iced before take-off, in line with the company's de-icing procedure, to avoid potential consequences of contamination on the tailplane. 3. This accident shows the significance of good crew resource management (CRM) in the cockpit when an unexpected and extreme flight situation occurs.

All four crew members and 35 persons on the ground were killed. Flight 6491 departed Hong Kong on a cargo service to Istanbul, carrying a load of 85618 kgs. An en route refueling and crew change stop was planned at Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. Weather at Bishkek was poor with winds from 60Â°at 1 m/s and a visibility (RVR) of 400m at the beginning of the runway; 350m at the mid-point and 400m at the end of the runway. Vertical visibility was 50 m. Air temperature was -9Â°C, dew point -10Â°C, pressure (QNH) was 1023,9 hPa. The initial descent towards Bishkek was normal. The crew contacted Approach Control at 07:06 hours and were cleared for a descent to FL060 as per TOKPA 1 STAR (Standard terminal arrival route). The aircraft overflew the TOPKA reporting point at 07:11 at FL092 while in descent. According to the approach chart, FL060 or above should be reached when overflying TOKPA. Shortly afterwards the controller cleared the flight for an ILS approach to runway 26. At 07:12 the controller cleared the crew for further descent to altitude 3400 ft. The aircraft was meanwhile crossing FL074. The crew was busy monitoring the flight altitude and was aware they were higher than the STAR chart. The localizer was capture at 3600 ft agl. At that time the altitude should have been 1345 ft agl (3400 ft amsl). At 07:15:21 after the crew confirmed capturing the localizer, the flight was handed over to Tower Control. At a distance of 1.7 nm the aircraft reached 3400 ft amsl and the ALT HOLD OPER autopilot mode was engaged longitudinally. At that point the flight was already over 400 ft above the glideslope. The glideslope mode was armed (G/S MODE ARM), but the glideslope was not captured. At 07:15:31 while the aircraft was in level flight at 3400 ft amsl Outer Marker overflight was recorded (as per the approach chart Outer Marker overflight altitude is 2800 ft amsl).  A glideslope signal was captured at 07:15:52, at that time the aircraft was almost over VOR/DME MANAS at a distance of approximately 1.1 nm from the runway 26 threshold, at an angle of approximately 9Â°. However, as per the approach chart, the rated glideslope angle is 3Â°. The aircraft automatically initiated descent with a vertical speed of up to 1425 ft/min. Six seconds after the glideslope capture LAND 3 autoland status annunciation was recorded. The crew called out the annunciation. At 07:16:01 at 3300 ft amsl the aircraft crossed the Middle Marker (as per the approach chart MM overflight altitude is 2290 ft amsl). After the glideslope descent was initiated the glideslope pointer was fluctuating within - 4 to + 4 dots. At 07:16:07, at 3150 ft amsl, AP CAUTION and FMA FAULT 2 events were recorded. These events were continuously recorded almost until the end of the flight. An FMA FAULT 2 means that the autopilot can no longer track the actual glideslope, but will track a constant 3Â° glide path until a valid glideslope signal is regained or until the crew intervenes by disengaging the autopilot or initiating a go-around. As the aircraft was descending LAND 3 status degraded to LAND 2, which was confirmed by the crew callout. LAND 2 means that the autopilot flight director system redundancy is reduced to the use of only two of the three autopilots. The EGPWS 'Glideslope' alert was then triggered 5 times.  At 07:17:04 the flight crossed the runway 26 departure end at a height of about 110 ft. Decision height was 99 ft. The FO then called ""Minimums"" and the captain informed that there was no visual contact and called to go-around. At 58 ft radar altitude the TOGA switch was pushed and engine power increased. 3.5 seconds after the TOGA switch had been pushed the aircraft hit slightly upsloping terrain and obstacles. The ground speed at the time of impact was 165 kt. The maximum recorded vertical acceleration was 6 g. Initial impact occurred at a distance of approximately 930 m from the runway 26 departure end. It collided with a concrete airport fence and rolled into a holiday village. The aircraft broke up and spilt fuel caught fire. Conclusion: The cause of the Boeing 747-412F TC-MCL aircraft accident was the missing control of the crew over the aircraft position in relation to the glideslope during the automatic approach, conducted at night in the weather conditions, suitable for ICAO CAT II landing, and as a result, the measures to perform a go-around, not taken in due time with the aircraft, having a significant deviation from the established approach chart, which led to the controlled flight impact with terrain (CFIT) at the distance of Â930 m beyond the end of the active RWY. The contributing factors were, most probably, the following: - the insufficient pre-flight briefing of the flight crew members for the flight to Manas aerodrome (Bishkek), regarding the approach charts, as well as the non-optimal decisions taken by the crew when choosing the aircraft descent parameters, which led to the arrival at the established approach chart reference point at a considerably higher flight altitude; - the lack of the crew's effective measures to decrease the aircraft vertical position and its arrival at the established approach chart reference point while the crew members were aware of the actual aircraft position being higher than required by the established chart; - the lack of the requirements in the Tower controllers' job instructions to monitor for considerable aircraft position deviations from the established charts while the pertinent technical equipment for such monitoring was available; - the excessive psycho-emotional stress of the crew members caused by the complicated approach conditions (night time, CAT II landing, long-lasting working hours) and their failure to eliminate the flight altitude deviations during a long time period. Additionally, the stress level could have been increased due to the crew's (especially the PIC's) highly emotional discussion of the ATC controllers' instructions and actions. Moreover, the ATC controllers' instructions and actions were in compliance with the established operational procedures and charts; - the lack of the crew members' monitoring for crossing the established navigational reference points (the glideslope capture point, the LOM and LIM reporting points); - the crew's failure to conduct the standard operational procedure which calls for altitude verification at the FAF/FAP, which is stated in the FCOM and the airline's OM. On the other hand, the Jeppesen Route Manual, used by the crew, contains no FAF/FAP in the RWY 26 approach chart; - the onboard systems' ""capture"" of the false glideslope beam with the angle of Â9Â°; - the design features of the Boeing 747-400 aircraft type regarding the continuation of the aircraft approach descent in the automatic mode with the constant descent angle of 3Â° (the inertial path) with the maintained green indication of the armed automatic landing mode (regardless of the actual aircraft position in relation to the RWY) while the aircraft systems detected that the glideslope signal was missing (after the glideslope signal ""capture""). With that, the crew received the designed annunciation, including the aural and visual caution alerts; - the absence of the red warning alert for the flight crew in case of a ""false"" glideslope capture and the transition to the inertial mode trajectory, which would require immediate control actions from the part of the crew; - the lack of monitoring from the part of the crew over the aircraft position in regard to the approach chart, including the monitoring by means of the Navigation Display (ND), engaged in the MAP mode; - the crew's failure to conduct the Airline's Standard Operational Procedures (SOPs), regarding the performance of the go-around procedure in case the ""AUTOPILOT"" (the AP switching to the inertial mode) and ""GLIDESLOPE"" (the EGPWS annunciation of the significant glideslope deviation) alerts during the automatic CAT II landing at true heights below 1000 ft (with no visual reference established with either the runway environment or with the lighting system); - the delayed actions for initiating the go-aroundMETAR: 01:00 UTC / 07:00 local time: UCFM 160100Z VRB01MPS 0050 R26/0300N FZFG VV001 M09/M10 Q1023 R26/19//60 NOSIG01:30 UTC / 07:30 local time: UCFM 160130Z VRB01MPS 0150 R26/0550 FZFG VV001 M09/M10 Q1024 R26/19//60 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: Other false glideslope-related incidents History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  2 December 2011 9V-SFL Singapore Airlines Cargo 0 Singapore-Changi International Airport (SIN/WSSS) min Runway excursion Location  Images: photo (c) Nataev; Bishkek-Manas International Airport (FRU); 16 January 2017; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) MAK; Bishkek-Manas International Airport (FRU); January 2017 photo (c) MAK; Bishkek-Manas International Airport (FRU); January 2017 photo (c) MAK; Bishkek-Manas International Airport (FRU); January 2017 photo (c) MAK; Bishkek-Manas International Airport (FRU); 20 January 2017 photo (c) MAK; Bishkek-Manas International Airport (FRU); 20 January 2017 photo (c) MAK; 20 January 2017 photo (c) MAK; 20 January 2017 photo (c) Tomoaki Kongou; Hong Kong-Chek Lap Kok International Airport (HKG/VHHH); 11 September 2016; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) Kelvin Jahae; Maastricht/Aachen Airport (MST/EHBK); 11 January 2017; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) Claude Davet; Brussel-Zaventem Airport (BRU/EBBR) [OO]; 15 March 2008; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) Merijn Passchier; Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS/EHAM); 31 August 2005; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane then exited his field of view. After impact, the airplane slid about 650 feet across the ramp on a 060-degree magnetic heading before it collided with an 8-feet tall concrete wall. No evidence was found of any preexisting mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation of the airplane. Toxicology testing revealed the pilot's use of multiple psychoactive substances including marijuana, venlafaxine, amphetamine, pseudoephedrine, clonazepam, and pheniramine. The wide variety of psychoactive effects of these medications precludes predicting the specific effects of their use in combination. However, it is likely that the pilot was impaired by the effects of the combination of psychoactive substances he was using and that those effects contributed to his loss of control. The investigation was unable to obtain medical records regarding any underlying neuropsychiatric disease(s); therefore, whether these may have contributed to the accident circumstances could not be determined. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The pilot's exceedance of the airplane's critical angle of attack during takeoff, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's impairment by the effects of a combination of psychoactive substances.""METAR: 19:40 UTC / 12:40 local time: KTUS 231940Z 24012G22KT 10SM OVC060 19/06 A2989 RMK AO2 ACFT MISHAP T01940061Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: WPR17FA057 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: AZfamily.com  Tucson.com  FAA  NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) Tanya Duarte; Tucson International Airport, AZ (TUS); 23 January 2017 photo (c) Tanya Duarte; Tucson International Airport, AZ (TUS); 23 January 2017 photo (c) NTSB; Tucson International Airport, AZ (TUS); 23 January 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Tucson International Airport, AZ (TUS); 23 January 2017; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot and his passenger suffered fatal injuries. The aircraft was flying a display during the City of Perth Australia Day Skyworks 2017 event. It departed Serpentine Airport at 16:28 and proceeded along the coast towards Perth. A holding pattern was flown to the east of Garden Island at an altitude of approximately 1600 feet, waiting to fly a display. At 16:50 it continued flying north towards Perth in company with a Cessna Caravan amphibian. Both aircraft conducted a series of circuits that included low-level fly-pasts of the Langley Park foreshore. After the second fly-past, the pilot of VH-CQA commenced a third circuit, while the Caravan departed the area. As part of the third circuit, the pilot of the Mallard flew in an easterly direction, parallel with the South Perth foreshore, before commencing a left turn. This would have facilitated a third pass in a westerly direction along the Langley Park foreshore. During the left turn, the aircraft rolled left and pitched nose down, consistent with an aerodynamic stall. The aircraft collided with the water and broke up. The pilot and passenger were fatally injured. Contributing factors: - The pilot returned the aircraft to the display area for a third pass in a manner contrary to the approved inbound procedure and which required the use of increased manoeuvring within a confined area to establish the aircraft on the display path. - During the final positioning turn for the third pass, the aircraft aerodynamically stalled at an unrecoverable height. - The pilot's decision to carry a passenger on a flight during the air display was contrary to the Instrument of Approval issued by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority for this air display and increased the severity of the accident consequence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ATSB Report number: AO-2017-013 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: The Courier Mail, 26-1-2017  Flightradar24  ATSB   Location  Images: photo (c) Jim Woodrow; Swan River, Perth, WA; 26 January 2017 photo (c) Jim Woodrow; Swan River, Perth, WA; 26 January 2017 photo (c) Flightaware / Google; Swan River, Perth, WA; 26 January 2017 photo (c) ATSB / Google; Swan River, Perth, WA; 26 January 2017 photo (c) Robert Frola; Watts Bridge Airport (YWSG); 10 April 2016 photo (c) Martin Watson; Watts Bridge Airport (YWSG); September 2015 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft took off from the BogotÃ¡ Airport at 15:50 hours local time. The flight was normal and the aircraft was cleared for the VOR approach to runway 21. The controller notified the crew of a 350Â° wind at 4 knots and a wet runway. At 16:57, the aircraft touched down abeam taxiway Alpha. Immediately afterwards, when the deceleration began, with the application of the reverses, an explosion occurred. The crew observed that the auto-braking system was not operating, so they decided to deactivate it and execute manual braking. Both captain and first officer failed to get a response when applying the brakes so the captain decided to activate the reversers again with 400 metres of runway remaining. The aircraft continued to roll and crossed the threshold stopping in the safety zone, twenty meters from the runway threshold. Approximately one minute after the plane stopped, the crew opened the cargo door and evacuated by their own means; the four occupants were unharmed. Probable cause(s) The investigation determined that the accident was caused by the following causal factors: Poor maintenance procedures of the aircraft operator, by not applying complete and adequate corrective actions to determine the root cause of repeated tire failure. Brake system failure as a result of a break in the hydraulic lines and harness housed in the right landing gear compartment caused by pieces of rubber from tire No. 4 bursting during the landing run. Bursting of tire No. 4 due to the over bending action it suffered as a result of being inflated and over inflated repeatedly, due to different reports of low tire pressure. Runway departure during the deceleration during the landing manoeuvre in Leticia. Contributing Factors Inadequate risk management of the Operator, since the repeated reports of discrepancies were not known or dealt with by its Operational Safety Management area. Poor conditions in the safety zone, in the extension of the Leticia aerodrome's header 03, whose unevenness and flooding contributed to the damage to the aircraft.METAR: 00:00 UTC / 19:00 local time: SKLT 290000Z 00000KT 8000 -DZ BKN010 25/25 A2984 RMK AD OPER IMC21:00 UTC / 16:00 local time: SKLT 282100Z 00000KT 9999 SCT010 BKN015 27/24 A298222:00 UTC / 17:00 local time: SKLT 282200Z 32003KT 9999 -DZ SCT010 BKN015 27/24 A2980 RERA23:00 UTC / 18:00 local time: SKLT 282300Z 00000KT 9999 -RA BKN010 BKN080 26/24 A2986 RMK AD OPER IMCAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: Aerocivil Report number: COL-17-05-GIA Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Aerocivil   Location  Images: photo (c) Leslie Snelleman; Sydney-Kingsford Smith International Airport, NSW (SYD/YSSY); 20 January 2007 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

About three minutes into the flight there was a failure of the left main and essential bus that prompted a return to Freeport. Upon landing on runway 06, there was a collapse of the left main gear and subsequently a runway excursion occurred. Minor injuries were reported to passengers. The Air Accident Investigation Department has determined that the probable cause of this accident was ineffective crew resource management and an unstable approach which led to the failure of the left main landing gear upon touchdown. Contributing factors to this accident includes; inadequate systems knowledge, lack of situational awareness and failure to diagnose and remedy multiple system failures in a timely manner resulted in compound failures being escalated to an emergency. The apparent rush to get on the ground without exploring other possible options to identify and verify landing gear security also contributed to the severity of this accident. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS - Ineffective CRM, complacency and a complete departure from company standard operating procedures and regulatory requirements were evidently a contributing factor in this accident. - Inadequate training and systems knowledge of both airman greatly contributed to the accident. - Hurried approach to get on the ground and failure to explore all available options to remedy the gear unsafe situation encountered was also a contributory factor.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAID Bahamas Report number: A17-000602 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Air Accident Investigation Department of The Bahamas   Location  Images: photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Nassau-Lynden Pindling International Airport (NAS/MYNN); 03 January 2015 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft was conducting a charter passenger flight from Essendon Airport to King Island, Tasmania.  The four passengers arrived at the terminal at 08:41 and were escorted by the pilot directly to the aircraft. At 08:49, the left engine was started and, shortly after, the right engine was started. At 08:53, the pilot requested a taxi clearance for King Island, with five persons onboard, under the instrument flight rules. He was cleared to taxi to holding point Tango for runway 17. At 08:58, ATC cleared the flight for take-off on runway 17 with departure instructions to turn right onto a heading of 200Â°. The pilot read back the instruction and commenced the takeoff roll. The aircraftÂs take-off roll along runway 17 was longer than expected. Witnesses familiar with the aircraft type observed a noticeable yaw to the left after the aircraft became airborne. The aircraft entered a relatively shallow climb and the landing gear remained down. The shallow climb was followed by a substantial left sideslip, while maintaining a roll attitude of less than 10Â° to the left. Airservices ADS-B data indicated the aircraft reached a maximum height of approximately 160 ft above ground level while tracking in an arc to the left of the runway centreline . The aircraftÂs track began diverging to the left of the runway centreline before rotation and the  Following the sustained left sideslip, the aircraft began to descend and at 08:58:48 the pilot transmitted on the Essendon Tower frequency repeating the word 'MAYDAY' seven times in rapid succession. Approximately 10 seconds after the aircraft became airborne, and 2 seconds after the transmission was completed, the aircraft collided with the roof of a building in the Essendon Airport Bulla Road Precinct - Retail Outlet Centre, coming to rest in a loading area at the rear of the building. Contributing factors - The aircraft's rudder trim was likely in the full nose-left position at the commencement of the take-off. - The aircraft's full nose-left rudder trim setting was not detected by the pilot prior to take-off. - Following a longer than expected ground roll, the pilot took-off with full left rudder trim selected. This configuration adversely affected the aircraft's climb performance and controllability, resulting in a collision with terrain. Other factors that increased risk: - The flight check system approval process did not identify that the incorrect checklist was nominated in the operatorÂs procedures manual and it did not ensure the required checks, related to the use of the cockpit voice recorder, were incorporated. - The aircraft's cockpit voice recorder did not record the accident flight, resulting in a valuable source of safety related information not being available. - The aircraft's maximum take-off weight was likely exceeded by about 240 kilograms. - Two of the four buildings within the Bulla Road Precinct Retail Outlet Centre exceeded the obstacle limitation surface (OLS) for Essendon Airport, however, the OLS for the departure runway was not infringed and VH-ZCR did not collide with those buildings.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ATSB Report number: AO-2017-024 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: ATSB  The Age   Location  Images: photo (c) ATSB; Melbourne-Essendon Airport, VIC (MEB); 21 February 2017 photo (c) ATSB; Melbourne-Essendon Airport, VIC (MEB); 21 February 2017 photo (c) ATSB; Melbourne-Essendon Airport, VIC (MEB); 21 February 2017 photo (c) Alec Wilson; Melbourne-Essendon Airport, VIC (MEB); 24 November 2014; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

On February 23, 2017, the aircraft was due to operate a return flight from Isle Of Man-Ronaldsway Airport (IOM) to Belfast City Airport, Northern Ireland. The scheduled departure time was 07:15 UTC and the return flight was scheduled to arrive back at IOM at 08:50. Overnight and into the morning of the 23 February, Storm Doris underwent explosive cyclogenesis. The centre of the storm moved rapidly through Northern Ireland in the early hours, across northern England and out into the North Sea by the early afternoon. Strong winds were forecast for the area. The surface wind at Belfast, where runways 04 and 22 were available, was reported at 06:20 to be from 230Â° at 9 kt but, because they received no TAF for this destination, the pilots selected two alternate airports; Belfast International Airport and IOM. The latest weather information at IOM showed a wind from 230Â° at 32 kt gusting to 45 kt, creating a maximum crosswind component of 22 kt. The relevant maximum demonstrated crosswind component for the Let L-410 is 19.4 kt and this was included in the ÂPerformance LimitationsÂ section of the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) but the aircraft operator did not apply a limiting component of crosswind to its operations. The only wind limit that was applied and used by the crew was 45 kt for ground operation. When the wind changed to 260Â° at 39, gusting to 55 kt, the flight was delayed because this exceeded the ground operation limit, Departure At 07:50 the crew learnt the wind was from 290Â° at 31 G 40 kt and as both these more recent reports were within the ground operation limit, they decided to depart, with 550 kg of fuel on board.  Three passengers boarded and the aircraft taxied at 08:10. Shortly afterwards, at the request of Belfast City ATC, the crew were informed that the wind was from 320Â° at 31 G 46 kt, and IOM ATC asked the crew for their intentions because Belfast City ATC had reported no other known aircraft movements. The crew elected to continue the flight and took off on runway 26 at 08:23 hrs, when the reported wind was from 290Â° at 21 G 41 kt. The co-pilot was the Pilot Flying (PF) and the commander was Pilot Not Flying (PNF). No difficulties were encountered en route to Belfast. When the PNF contacted Belfast City ATC, he was told radar vectoring was available for an ILS approach to runway 04 and that the wind was now from 320Â° at 28 G 43 kt. The PNF informed ATC they would make one approach but would go around if the approach was not stable. The crew reported afterwards that they experienced continuous moderate turbulence during the latter part of the approach. The final wind check, given after they had been cleared to land, was from 320Â° at 35 kt. They judged that the aircraft operatorÂs stable approach criteria were met until the aircraft passed over the runway threshold, when turbulence de-stabilised the aircraft and they initiated a go-around. ATC reported that the aircraft went around from approximately 20 ft above the runway at 08:58 hrs and climbed straight ahead to 3,000 ft amsl, the standard missed approach procedure. The aircraft continued heading northeast until 09:01 hrs when the PNF informed ATC they would not make a second approach and would return to IOM. Return Once level at FL070, the PNF listened to the ATIS for the IOM, which stated runway 26 was in use, it was wet, and detailed the 0850 METAR, which noted that the wind was from 290Â° at 28 kt. The PF briefed for an approach with the flaps set to 18Â°, and a target VREF of 105 kt; with a ""slightly right crosswind"". After the brief was completed he commented on the intercom that the wind was ""not so challenging"" at IOM but shortly after this ATC provided a special weather observation, timed at 09:12 hrs, which stated the wind was now from 310Â° at 41 kt and gusting between 22 and 53 kt. When asked by ATC if they wished to make an approach, the PNF replied ""of course"". The crew accepted radar vectoring for an ILS approach to runway 26, with the co-pilot remaining as PF. Before the aircraft was directed towards its final approach, ATC reported the wind was from 310Â° at 43 kt but gusting between 23 and 63 kt. At 09:24, after the aircraft had become established on the ILS centreline and glideslope, ATC radioed clearance to land, with a reported wind of 300Â° at 41 kt but gusting between 31 and 63 kt. While receiving this message, the crew were also presented with an aural ""glideslope"" caution and immediately after this the PF declared ""1,000 ft stabilised"". While the PNF was adjusting the propeller rpm, another aural ""glideslope"" caution was annunciated and the PF immediately stated ""correcting"". Following an automatically generated message stating the aircraft was at 500 ft agl, one further ""glideslope"" caution was annunciated and the PF responded saying ""correcting, runway in sight"". The final wind check provided by ATC, approximately 35 seconds before the aircraft touched down, was from 300Â° at 48 kt, but gusting between 32 kt and 63 kt.  Landing Given the environmental conditions, ATC was concerned for the safety of the aircraft and its occupants when it landed, so the airfield Rescue and Fire Fighting Service (RFFS) had been placed on alert with two vehicles facing towards the runway, approximately 200 m from the touchdown zone. During the aircraftÂs approach, ATC discussed the situation with the Isle of Man Civil Aviation Administration because another of the same operatorÂs aircraft had been blown onto its wingtip while taxiing in 2007, in winds greater than 45 kt, and both parties knew 45 kt was now the operatorÂs maximum ground operation limit. As the aircraft crossed the threshold it seemed unstable and it rolled considerably, causing the tip of the left wing (the downwind wing) to tilt down until it seemed in close proximity to the runway, before the wheels made first contact. The aircraft then bounced and rolled left again before touching down for a second time, on all three wheels. After travelling along the runway for approximately 20 m, the right mainwheel was seen to lift off the ground and nearby RFFS witnesses estimated the left wingtip rolled to within one metre of the runway surface. The crew seemed aware of this roll because, approximately nine seconds after touchdown, the PF stated ""ailerons...good...too much roll"".  After landing the commander took control and the co-pilot commented ""taxi carefully with the wind"". ATC then stated the surface wind was from 300Â° at 47 kt, but gusting between 32 kt and 63 kt and asked if they wished to taxi or to hold on the runway. The crew replied ""we will try and taxi and if we can make it we will vacate, otherwise we need to leave the aircraft here"". The crew then accepted taxi instructions directing them towards the terminal but, 45 seconds later, as the aircraft was leaving the runway, ATC radioed to the crew, ""direction from Isle of Man CAA, hold position."" The aircraft stopped facing into the wind. Both ATC and the Isle of Man Civil Aviation Administration later indicated that they were concerned that if the aircraft continued to taxi with the wind gusting to 63 kt an accident could occur.  RFFS vehicles were positioned around the aircraft, to provide some screening from the wind, and a bus transferred the three uninjured passengers to the terminal building. The aircraft was later tied down until the wind subsided. Conclusion: The prime causal factor in this serious incident was the decision to land with a maximum crosswind component of 40 kt, which is approximately twice the maximum demonstrated certification value of 19.4 kt. In the view of the aircraft operator, there was no specific crosswind limit the crew needed to consider when deciding whether to operate the service or not. However, the OM Part A refers to a crosswind limit when it states: ÂFor planning purposes an aerodrome shall be considered below minimum if the steady crosswind exceeds the prescribed limitations.Â and other evidence from the AFM and the OM indicates that the maximum demonstrated crosswind component of 19.4 kt was limiting. Several contributory factors were also apparent: 1) By only studying weather reports for six airfields and without referring to any meteorology charts, the crew had insufficient information to assess the prevailing weather conditions en route and the stormÂs path. 2) The aircraft operator believed that a valid TAF could be disregarded upon the subsequent issue of a METAR that included a TREND forecast. 3) The aircraft operator did not provide adequate oversight to a flight in airspace affected by this storm. The commander did not refer to the available weather forecast charts and neither the OCC nor the FOM reviewed the situation with him, or suggested he seek guidance from the duty forecaster. 4) The fuel figures presented on the OFP did not account for the correct level of contingency fuel and did not allow for a realistic alternate routing. The aircraft had sufficient fuel for the sector, but the crew did not have as much extra fuel on-board as they believed they had, and the OM offered little guidance on the carriage of extra fuel when there was a possibility of widespread, adverse weather conditions. 5) The OFP only showed navigational and fuel information for the second of two selected alternates. However, the two Belfast airports are in close proximity so the lack of navigational information for the routing to the first alternate may not have been problematic in this instance. 6) The CVR evidence, that evolving threats did not precipitate verbal discussion between the pilots, indicates they had not been effectively trained in respect to CRM, and to threat management in particular. The OM appeared to lack guidance concerning the evaluation and management of threats, problem solving and decision making. 7) The approach became unstable before visual flight conditions were achieved, but the crew did not discuss this, and the required SOPs were not followed. 8) The limiting airspeed for flight with gear down and for flight with flaps extended was exceeded but no corrective action was taken. 9) The crew began taxiing the aircraft in a wind which was stronger than the wind which blew a similar aircraft onto its wingtip at IOM in 2007 and which exceeded the ground operation limit introduced after the 2007 accident.METAR: 06:20 UTC / 06:20 local time: EGNS 230620Z 23032G45KT 7000 -RA FEW012 SCT022 BKN030 07/04 Q0977 BECMG 31017KT07:20 UTC / 07:20 local time: EGNS 230720Z 25033G47KT 220V290 3000 RA FEW005 BKN008 OVC015 06/05 Q0973 NOSIG08:20 UTC / 08:20 local time: EGAC 230820Z 31029G46KT 9999 -SHRA FEW009 BKN012 03/01 Q098108:20 UTC / 08:20 local time: EGNS 230820Z 29029G42KT 5000 -RA FEW006 BKN009 BKN022 07/05 Q0975 TEMPO 3000 RA BKN007 [approx departure time]09:20 UTC / 09:20 local time: EGAC 230920Z 31023G40KT 9999 -RADZ FEW010 BKN014 04/02 Q098609:20 UTC / 09:20 local time: EGNS 230920Z 30042G56KT 4000 RA FEW005 BKN011 BKN033 05/03 Q0979 TEMPO 3000 BKN006 [approx landing time]10:20 UTC / 09:20 local time: EGNS 231020Z 30042G58KT 9999 -RA FEW009 BKN015 OVC025 05/02 Q0984 TEMPO 5000 RA BKN00611:20 UTC / 09:20 local time: EGNS 231120Z 30043G56KT 9000 -RA FEW012 SCT016 BKN028 06/03 Q0986 TEMPO 5000 BKN006Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: EW/C2017/02/04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  29 November 2018 OK-LAZ Van Air Europe, opf Trade Air 0 Dubrovnik Airport (LDDU) non Wrong runway/taxiway landing Location  Images: photo (c) AAIB; Isle Of Man-Ronaldsway Airport (IOM); February 2017 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft departed Edinburgh, Scotland, on a scheduled passenger service to Amsterdam at 14:21 UTC. About 15:22 UTC the aircraft entered a holding pattern over the North Sea off the western coast of the Netherlands because landing runways available were limited at Schiphol because of the strong surface wind.  It left the holding about 15:38 UTC and positioned for an ILS approach to runway 22. During the approach to Schiphol, at approximately 16:30 hours, ATC requested the crew to hold over reporting point SUGOL at flight level (FL) 110 for 20 minutes because landing runways available were limited at Schiphol because of the strong surface wind. ATIS information ÂKiloÂ reported winds from direction 240Â° with a velocity of 35 knots, gusting to 40 knots. METAR information reported winds at 37 knots gusting to 46 at 15.55 (UTC, 16.55 local time). From SUGOL the crew initially received radar vectors inbound Schiphol. They then were cleared to intercept the Instrument Landing System (ILS) for runway 22. The ILS for the approach to runway 22 was intercepted at 18 NM.  During the descent, at 15:49 UTC, the autopilot disengaged because of gusting winds in the approach and was reengaged by the crew shortly after. The arrival was flown in speed control mode with an airspeed of 170 knots. Final speed was selected at 130 knots, i.e. normal landing threshold speed (VREF) plus 10 knots to compensate for the gusting winds. At around 15:51 UTC, approximately 5.5 NM from the runway touchdown point, the landing gear was selected down, giving three greens indication in the cockpit shortly after. The crew confirmed the indication, 15 degrees flaps were selected and de-icing systems were selected. The crew then changed radio frequency to Schiphol Tower and received a clearance for landing on runway 22. The air traffic controller reported the wind from direction 240 degrees with speeds of 36 knots gusting to 48 knots. The crew finished the before landing checklist. They then selected 5 degrees flaps and selected gear down. They confirmed Âice protection onÂ, Âlanding gear three greensÂ, selected 15 degrees flaps and checked Âbleed air onÂ. At an altitude of 300 feet the flight crew disengaged the autopilot for landing. On short final the crew noticed the PAPI showing they were on the glide path. Although the pilots were aware they would encounter strong winds during landing, including crosswinds, the wind conditions were not extreme and were not above the aircraftÂs limitations. Short final was flown under crosswind conditions, with the nose of the aircraft about 20 degrees right of centre line. Just before touch down the pilot flying aligned the nose of the aircraft with the runway centreline and lowered the right wing to compensate for the crosswind, causing the right-hand main wheel to touch the runway first. The aircraft touched down at 15:54 UTC. The crew considered the landing to be firm, but not hard. Almost immediately after touch down the crew noticed the right wing dropping, and a red warning light appeared on the landing gear panel in the cockpit. The right-hand propeller, right-hand engine nacelle, lower fuselage, wing tip and aileron collided with the runway and the aircraft continued for several hundred meters before coming to a complete stop. This resulted in damage to the right hand propeller, the lower fuselage structure and right-hand outboard wing tip. The right-hand fuselage was also damaged due to fragments from the right-hand propeller and stone strikes. The left-hand main landing gear and nose gear remained extended. The crew transmitted a MAYDAY call and after coming to a complete stop the cabin attendants started evacuating the passengers via the two aft doors. The crew then shut down the aircraft in accordance with the checklist. As a precaution, they also pulled the circuit breakers from the flight data and cockpit voice recorders. During the accident and following evacuation no-one was injured. Conclusions: - Maintenance was performed on the night before the day of the mishap flight, during maintenance the MLG brace was replaced. The maintenance crew stated they did not find anything unusual during the installation of the brace. - After the accident, the newly installed stabilizer brace showed no deformation, nor did the attachment lugs on the yoke or the forward nacelle. - The PSEU showed several fault codes which were consistent with the condition of the aircraft during the approach and after the incident. - One of the MLG down lock sensors was found unreliable. The faulty sensor prevented the PSEU logic from closing the aft RH MLG doors and activating the unlock actuator. - The unlock actuator not being activated prevented the brace being aided to maintain its over centred position by hydraulic pressure. - The RH MLG yoke was found deformed. Analyses, and the fact no deformation was present on the stabilizer brace assembly, indicate that the deformation on the yoke was present prior to touchdown at Schiphol, and that this deformation was caused when NO stabilizer brace assembly was installed. - The deformation of the yoke placed the RH MLG in a condition outside the certification state, thereby exposing the RH MLG stabilizer brace assembly to the potential of unlocking. - The bent yoke caused friction in the MLG yoke and brace combination, which prevented at least one of the two stabilizer brace apex joints from achieving an over centre condition when the MLG was extended prior to landing. Although not designed for this, not hydraulically activating the unlock actuator after the gear was in the down position, prevented the brace assembly from being retained into over centre position. - Despite the fact the gear was not fully locked, and outside certification condition, three green lights indicated to the crew that the gear was down and locked. Although not noticed by the flying crew, the amber caution light indicating the aft RH MLG were open, most likely was lit during landing. - The combination of friction caused by the bent yoke, and faulty sensors preventing the unlock actuator to be activated, caused a situation whereby the stabilizer brace of the RH MLG did not get into over centre position causing an instable situation, despite the three LG green lights illuminated. - During an asymmetric (rolled) touchdown in Amsterdam torsion loads were applied to the MLG, and the MLG strut collapsed almost immediately after touchdown of the RH MLG, causing the accident to happen.METAR: 14:55 UTC / 15:55 local time: EHAM 231455Z 23034G48KT 180V260 9999 FEW022 09/03 Q0985 TEMPO 7000 -RA BKN02015:25 UTC / 16:25 local time: EHAM 231525Z 24037G51KT 9999 -RA FEW020 SCT032 08/04 Q0985 TEMPO 7000 BKN02015:55 UTC / 16:55 local time: EHAM 231555Z 24031G46KT 210V270 9999 -RA FEW020 SCT028 BKN037 08/04 Q0985 TEMPO 7000 BKN020Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Dutch Safety Board Report number: 2017016 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) Onderzoeksraad voor Veiligheid; Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS); 23 February 2017 photo (c) Onderzoeksraad voor Veiligheid; Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS); 23 February 2017 photo (c) Onderzoeksraad voor Veiligheid; Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS); 23 February 2017 photo (c) Onderzoeksraad voor Veiligheid; Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS); 23 February 2017 photo (c) Flightradar24; Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS); 23 February 2017 photo (c) Werner Fischdick; DÃ¼sseldorf International Airport (DUS/EDDL); 15 June 2013 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

During the pushback from Stand 1 at Manchester Airport, in dark and wet conditions, the flight deck crew felt a fore and aft jolt and heard a mechanical ""clunk"". The commander informed the headset operator who conferred with the tug driver, and then visually checked the towbar and its attachment to the tug and to the aircraft. The ground crew saw nothing abnormal and they assumed the clunk was due to the tow hitch shifting, which is a familiar occurrence. The headset operator informed the commander that all was well, and the pushback continued. In response to a request from the commander, the headset operator indicated the left engine could be started, although the aircraft had not reached the designated engine start positon for that stand. As the aircraft was halted, in preparation for being pulled forward to the release point, the headset operator approved a request from the flight deck crew to start the right engine. The commander was conscious of the aircraft beginning to move gently forward, while he was concentrating on starting the right engine. Both the tug and the headset operator were concealed from his field of view and he was not surprised when the aircraftÂs nose turned first to the right and then to the left, as if it was being lined-up on the taxiway centreline. He then heard an urgent instruction from the headset operator for the brakes to be applied, so he responded by pressing on the toe brakes before setting the park brake. The headset operator then informed him that the tug and aircraft had collided, but that nobody was injured. Both engines were then shut down. Ground crew from adjacent stands came to assist and found the towbar was still connected to both the tug and to the aircraft. The nose gear leg was rotated approximately 90Â° to the left and the tow bar was bent around the front corner of the tug. The shear pins on the towbar had fractured, and pieces were later found within the boundary of the stand, but the central retaining pin remained intact. The passengers and crew disembarked without injury from the rear right exit door. An investigation by the ground handling company showed One of the pins on this towbar had failed 16 days before the accident and only that pin had been replaced. It was also established that other maintenance procedures for the shear pins had not been followed. They had not been lubricated correctly and the training given to ground crews did not prepare them for conducting adequate serviceability checks on the pins.

The aircraft had been chartered by the University of Michigan Basketball team for a flight to a game in Washington, DC. The flight crew prepared for take-off and calculated V-speeds (V1, VR, V2) using ""Normal Thrust Takeoff"", a 10 kts headwind, and a take-off weight of 146,600 lbs. The V-speeds for this configuration were 139 kts, 142 kts, and 150 kts, respectively. However, the flight crew chose to increase VR to 150 kts to allow for more control during take-off in the presence of windshear. During takeoff roll, at 14:51:56 (about 3,000 ft down the runway) and about 138 kts of airspeed, the control column was pulled back slightly from a non-dimensional value of -7 to -5.52. The airplaneÂs left elevator followed the control input and moved from a position of -15Â° trailing edge down to -13Â° trailing edge down. The right elevator did not change and stayed at approximately -16Â° trailing edge down. At 14:52:01 a large control column input was made (151 kts and 4100 ft down the runway) to a non-dimensional 18.5 and the left elevator moves to a position near 15Â° trailing edge up. After 14:52:05 the right elevator moves to -13Â° trailing edge down, but no more. The airplane does not respond in pitch and does not rotate. The captain decided to abort the takeoff. The maximum groundspeed was 163 kts (173 kts airspeed) and the airplane began to decelerate as soon as the brakes were applied at 14:52:08. Spoilers were deployed at 14:52:10 and thrust reversers were deployed between 14:52:13 and 14:52:15. The aircraft could not be stopped on the runway. The airplaneÂs ground speed was 100 kts when it left the paved surface. The aircraft overran the end of the runway, damaged approach lights, went through the perimeter fence and crossed Tyler Road. It came to rest on grassy terrain, 345 meters past the end of the runway, with the rear fuselage across a ditch. The nose landing gear had collapsed.  Runway 23L is a 7543 ft long runway. Post-accident examination by the NTSB revealed movement of the control column in the cockpit appeared normal; the control columns were free to move, and the elevator control tabs moved as commanded. However, when investigators tried to move the elevator surfaces by hand, the left elevator moved normally, but the right elevator was jammed in a trailing edge-down position (airplane nose down). Upon further inspection, the right elevator geared tab inboard pushrod linkage was found damaged which restricted movement of the right elevator surface but allowed movement of the control tab. After the damaged components were removed, the elevator could be moved by hand. Examination of the flight data recorder data indicates that during the taxi and take-off roll, the left elevator moved normally, but the right elevator did not move. During takeoff roll, the left elevator began a large airplane nose-up movement (consistent with rotation) at an airspeed of about 152 knots and continued for five seconds to about 166 knots. There was no change in the airplane pitch attitude during this time. The airplane data then are consistent with the takeoff being rejected. The maximum recorded airspeed was about 173 knots. Review of previous flight data showed normal movement of both the left and right elevator surfaces.  The airplane flew to Ypsilanti two days before the accident. Probable Cause: ""The NTSB determines that the probable cause of this accident was the jammed condition of the airplaneÂs right elevator, which resulted from exposure to localized, dynamic wind while the airplane was parked and rendered the airplane unable to rotate during takeoff. Contributing to the accident were (1) the effect of a large structure on the gusting surface wind at the airplaneÂs parked location, which led to turbulent gust loads on the right elevator sufficient to jam it, even though the horizontal surface wind speed was below the certification design limit and maintenance inspection criteria for the airplane, and (2) the lack of a means to enable the flight crew to detect a jammed elevator during preflight checks for the Boeing MD-83 airplane. Contributing to the survivability of the accident was the captainÂs timely and appropriate decision to reject the takeoff, the check airmanÂs disciplined adherence to standard operating procedures after the captain called for the rejected takeoff, and the dimensionally compliant runway safety area where the overrun occurred.""METAR: 16:53 UTC / 11:53 local time: KYIP 081653Z 26035G50KT 10SM CLR 11/M11 A2981 RMK AO2 PK WND 26055/1639 SLP095 T0106110617:53 UTC / 12:53 local time: KYIP 081753Z A2979 RMK AO2 PK WND 24046/1656 SLPNO 58012 $19:53 UTC / 14:55 local time: KDTW 081953Z 26033G44KT 10SM FEW050 12/M14 A2980 RMK AO2 PK WND 24051/1926 SLP095 T01171144Weather for Detroit Metro Airport, 13 km east of KYIPAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NTSB/AAR-19/01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 12 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: WXYZ  FAA  M Live  NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Detroit-Willow Run Airport, MI (YIP); March 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Detroit-Willow Run Airport, MI (YIP); March 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Detroit-Willow Run Airport, MI (YIP); March 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Detroit-Willow Run Airport, MI (YIP); March 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Detroit-Willow Run Airport, MI (YIP); March 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Detroit-Willow Run Airport, MI (YIP); March 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Detroit-Willow Run Airport, MI (YIP); March 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Detroit-Willow Run Airport, MI (YIP); March 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Detroit-Willow Run Airport, MI (YIP); March 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Detroit-Willow Run Airport, MI (YIP); March 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Detroit-Willow Run Airport, MI (YIP); March 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Detroit-Willow Run Airport, MI (YIP); March 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Detroit-Willow Run Airport, MI (YIP); March 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) Google Earth; Detroit-Willow Run Airport, MI (YIP); 08 March 2017 photo (c) NTSB; Detroit-Willow Run Airport, MI (YIP); 08 March 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) Adam Moreira; New York-John F.

The seat belt sign was on and the on-board radar was not depicting any precipitation.   The aircraft experienced unexpected turbulence.  The #2 and the #4 FAs were seated in their jumpseats in the rear of the aircraft, however, their seatbelts were not fastened.  Both the #2 and the #4 FAs struck the overhead ceiling panel and fell to the floor.  No passengers reported injuries and the FAs were able to complete their duties.  Emergency Medical Service personnel met the FAs at the gate and transported to the hospital.

The aircraft came to rest on the right side of the runway. The nose landing gear had collapsed and the right hand wing tip was bent. Kalaupapa Airport is an uncontrolled (nontowered) airport with a single runway and no taxiways. The pilots use a common frequency to state their intentions.  The pilot of the Grand Caravan reported that she was going to establish an approach and landing to runway 05. While on a seven-mile final, she communicated with the pilot of an airplane that was on short final for the same airport. The pilot that was on short final reported that he would report when he was clear of the runway, and he did. The commuter pilot acknowledged the other pilot's clear of runway transmission, and initiated the approach.  As the pilot descended through 150 feet above ground level, she noticed that the airplane that she had communicated with was not clear of the runway. The airplane on the ground was near the runway 23 numbers with the propeller turning, facing toward her landing airplane. She aborted the landing but the airplane did not climb. The airplane impacted the runway hard and bounced. She reported that when the airplane touched down after the bounce, she ""applied left rudder pedal to steer the aircraft off the runway and out of the way of the other aircraft's possible flight path."" The airplane exited the left side of the runway and ground-looped to the left. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right side of the fuselage and the right wing.  After the ground-loop, the pilot of the airplane near the runway 23 numbers attempted to takeoff.

The aircraft was on a scheduled passenger flight from Perth Airport and had two flight crew, five cabin crew, and 177 passengers on board. The first officer was the Pilot Flying (PF) and the Captain was performing the role of the Pilot Monitoring (PM). Air traffic control (ATC) cleared the flight to descend and advised its flight crew to expect an arrival on runway 17. The controller also requested that the crew maintain maximum speed. In response, a descent speed of 320 kt was selected, 40 kt above the standard descent speed of 280 kt. The aircraftâs maximum allowable operating speed (VMO) was 340 kt. At about 22:00, the flight crew informed ATC that descent from flight level (FL) 310 had commenced and reported some light to moderate turbulence. Shortly after, ATC informed the flight crew that there would be a runway change to 35. At about 22:04, the flight was descending past FL 280 when the flight crew made an announcement over the aircraftâs public address system advising the cabin crew to prepare for landing. That announcement provided a cue to the cabin crew that they had about 10 minutes to secure all loose items in the cabin before illumination of the âfasten seat beltâ sign. By the time the aircraft passed FL 270, it had accelerated to the flight crew selected speed of 320 kt. At about 22:09, the turbulence began to increase. In response, the flight crew switched on the âfasten seat beltâ sign and advised the passengers and crew to be seated with seat belts fastened. The operatorâs procedures required cabin crew members to be seated within 1 minute of that announcement. At that time, a cabin crew member was passing row 22 on her way back to the rear of the cabin. The aircraftâs movement due to the turbulence was such that she needed to hold onto the overhead lockers as she walked along the aisle. About 15 seconds later, she reached the rear galley, closed a stowage latch, and secured a rubbish bin in preparation to be seated in the left cabin crew seat. When the flight descended through FL 220 (about 30 seconds after the âfasten seat beltâ sign was switched on), the wind direction changed by about 80 degrees, resulting in a head wind increase from 15 kt to 32 kt. That in turn led to the airspeed increasing through 325 kt, and the PF applying control column backpressure to avoid exceeding VMO. About 1 second after the maximum control column force was applied, the autopilot disengaged and the G-Load4 peaked at 2.2 g. The pilot monitoring reported that they were checking the instrument approach, as a result of the change to runway 35, when they heard the autopilot disengage tone and saw the speed of the aircraft increasing toward VMO. The aircraftâs pitch angle changed by 3.87 degrees in 1 second, and its airspeed reached a maximum of 339.5 kt. The cabin crew member recalled that, while standing in the rear galley and preparing for arrival, she felt the cabin floor drop and then quickly come up. The force due to the aircraftâs movement resulted in the cabin crew member fracturing her leg. The cabin crew member seated in the right rear seat assisted the injured cabin crew member. The aircraft movement also resulted in a second cabin crew member in the forward galley falling forward and hitting her head on a trolley. She also received injuries to her knees, back and neck. The flight crew received an interphone call from the cabin reporting the leg fracture injury. The turbulence subsided and the flight crew turned off the âfasten seat beltâ sign and first aid was provided to the injured crew members. At about 22:11, the aircraftâs speed decreased and the flight crew re-engaged the autopilot. The flight crew alerted ATC to the turbulence and were informed that no other turbulence had been reported in the area. Due to her fractured leg, the injured crew member in the rear galley remained lying on the cabin floor for the landing. The aircraft landed at about 22:34, and paramedics met the aircraft to attend to the two injured cabin crew members. Both of them were transferred to a hospital for treatment. The cabin crew member injured in the rear galley was admitted to the hospital. The other crew member was treated and discharged without admission. The aircraft was not damaged and none of the other crew or any of the passengers were injured. Findings - The increase in headwind while VH-VZZ was making a routine high speed descent at 320 kt resulted in the airspeed increasing towards the aircraftâs maximum allowable speed. - The pilot flying applied a control column input to prevent an overspeed, which resulted in the autopilot unexpectedly disengaging. The consequent change of pitch and g-loading led to two cabin crew suffering injuries. - The aircraftâs autopilot had been modified such that, if sufficient control column back pressure was applied, the autopilot would disengage rather than revert to the Control Wheel Steering (CWS) mode. Autopilot disengagement resulted in larger elevator and pitch responses than those associated with reversion to CWS mode.

There were no injuries, but the aircraft sustained substantial damage. After approximately one hour and ten minutes of flight time, during the descent procedure, the no.2 propeller rpm suddenly increased. The crewmembers performed the procedures set out in the aircraft manuals and proceeded to their destination. The crew carried out an NDB approach to runway 09 at Coari-Urucu Airport in light rain conditions. After touchdown the right propeller did not assume the reverse pitch with the throttle in position below Ground Idle. The aircraft then yawed to the left and veered off the runway approximately 500 m after the touchdown point, traveling about 180 m through the grass. Contributing factors. - Attention Â a contributor. The lack of attention to the lighting of the Low Pitch lights contributed to the application of reverse in both engines, with only one of the lights on. Thus, this action contributed to the asymmetric reverse condition, which allowed the aircraft to exit the runway on the left. - Emotional state Â undetermined. The feeling of apprehension experienced by the crewmembers in relation to the length of the runway, associated with the condition of night operation and in the rain, may have affected their performance, so that, in an attempt to anticipate the engines entering the reverse regime, the standard landing procedures were not properly performed. - Aircraft maintenance Â undetermined.

According to Federal Aviation Administration personnel, about the time the airplane was rotating from runway 10L, the pilot experienced a light vibration; he subsequently returned to BOI and landed uneventfully. During a post-landing examination of the airplane, it was revealed that a portion of the outboard section of a left propeller blade, which had fragmented into 2 pieces, was missing. Additionally, about a 4 inch by 4 inch puncture hole was observed to have gone through the left forward side of the fuselage just aft of the main air stair door; a piece of the propeller blade was found in the cabin. It was further noted during a runway sweep for foreign objects shortly after the occurrence, that a screw driver which had been used during maintenance on the airplane earlier, and the second piece of the propeller blade tip, were both recovered from the departure runway in the same approximate location from where the airplane would have rotated.

The left hand main landing gear reportedly impacted a fire truck that was located besides the runway. The aircraft then burst into flames. According to the Juba Airport general manager, the aircraft took off from Juba at 14:07, bound for Wau. He stated there were 44 passengers: 39 adults, one child and four infants along with five crew members. South Supreme Airlines said the plane had been carrying five crew members and 40 passengers. In some media the airline reported that 24 passengers disembarked the plane at its first stop in Aweil. That would have meant that the aircraft travelled over 770 km with an intermediate stop in about eighty minutes time.Sources: khaleejtimes.com  South Sudan: Plane Carrying 21 Crashes in Wau, Causing Some Injuries / Voice of America  South Sudan in Focus  https://www.scramble.nl/database/soviet/details/27_20845  Location  Images: photo (c) UNMISS; Wau Airport (WUU); 20 March 2017; (nc-nd) photo (c) UNMISS; Wau Airport (WUU); 20 March 2017; (nc-nd) photo (c) UNMISS; Wau Airport (WUU); 20 March 2017; (nc-nd) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates24-Mar-2024 17:18 zhr2005 Updated [Cn, Source, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The private pilot, and sole occupant, was fatally injured. The airplane was destroyed by the impact and post-impact fire. The flight originated from Cincinnati Airport, Ohio, about 18:12 hours local time, and was destined for Atlanta-Fulton County Airport, Georgia.  The flight was uneventful until the air traffic controller amended the flight plan, which required the pilot to manually enter the new routing information into the GPS. A few minutes later, the pilot told the controller that he was having problems with the GPS and asked for a direct route to his destination. The controller authorized the direct route and instructed the pilot to descend from 22,000 ft to 6,000 ft, during which time the sound of the autopilot disconnect was heard on the cockpit voice recorder. During the descent, the pilot told the controller that the airplane had a steering problem and was in the clouds. The pilot was instructed to descend the airplane to 4,100 ft, which was the minimum vectoring altitude. The airplane continued to descend, entered visual meteorological conditions, and then descended below the assigned altitude. The controller queried the pilot about the airplane's low altitude and instructed the pilot to maintain 4,100 ft. The pilot responded that he was unsure if he would be able to climb the airplane back to that altitude due to steering issues. The controller issued a low altitude warning and again advised the pilot to climb back to 4,100 ft. The pilot responded that the autopilot was working again and that he was able to climb the airplane to the assigned altitude. The controller then instructed the pilot to change to another radio frequency, but the pilot responded that he was still having a problem with the GPS. The pilot asked the controller to give him direct routing to the airport. A few minutes later, the pilot told the controller that he was barely able to keep the airplane straight and its wings level. The controller asked the pilot if he had the airport in sight, which he did not. The pilot then declared an emergency and expressed concerns related to identifying the landing runway. Afterward, radio contact between the controller and the pilot was lost. Shortly before the airplane impacted the ground, a witness saw the airplane make a complete 360Â° roll to the left, enter a steep 90Â° bank to the left, roll inverted, and enter a vertical nose-down dive. Another witness saw the airplane spiral to the ground. The airplane impacted the front lawn of a private residence, and a postcrash fire ensued.  The aircraft was a Sierra Eagle wing conversion of a Cessna 500 Citation I. This performance upgrade also allows single pilot operations. However, the NTSB found no record of the pilot receiving training for single-pilot operations in the accident airplane. Therefore it was unlikely that the pilot was properly certificated to act as a single-pilot. The pilot historically had difficulty flying the airplane without the aid of the autopilot. Given the pilot's previous experience with the GPS installed on the airplane, it is likely that during the accident flight the pilot became confused about how to operate the GPS and ultimately was unable to properly control of the airplane without the autopilot engaged. Probable cause: The pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed while manually flying the airplane, which resulted in the airplane exceeding its critical angle of attack and experiencing an aerodynamic stall. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's inability control the airplane without the aid of the autopilot.METAR: 22:53 UTC / 18:53 local time: KFTY 242253Z 16009KT 10SM SCT060 23/08 A3027 RMK AO2 SLP246 T02280083Weather at Fulton County Airport: wind 160Â° at 9 knots; scattered clouds at 6000 feet; Tempeture 23Â°C, Dew point: 8Â°C23:47 UTC / 19:47 local time: KRYY 242347Z 16008KT 10SM OVC055 21/09 A3028Weather at Cobb Country Airport: wind 160Â° at 8 knots; overcast at 5500 feet; Tempeture 21Â°C, Dew point: 9Â°C23:53 UTC / 19:53 local time: KFTY 242353Z 17006KT 10SM OVC060 22/09 A3028 RMK AO2 SLP250 T02220089 10233 20211 55006Weather at Fulton County Airport: wind 170Â° at 6 knots; overcast at 6000 feet; Tempeture 22Â°C, Dew point: 9Â°CAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA17FA135 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: 11alive  flightaware.com  NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Marietta, GA; March 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) Flightaware / Google Earth; Marietta, GA; 24 March 2017 photo (c) Alec Wilson; Fort Lauderdale-Executive Airport, FL (FXE/KFXE); 11 February 2017 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

After a normal flight, the aircraft started the approach in good weather conditions to runway 31 at Jauja Airport. That day, according to NOTAM CO510/17, maintenance work was being carried out on the runway and only the right side was available.  The landing at the Jauja Airport was made by the First Officer, who was in the qualification stage to operate to high altitude airports. After the contact of the main landing gears and two seconds after the nose gear had touched down, almost simultaneously with the activation of the reverse, the crew felt strong vibrations and oscillations accompanied by pitching up and down. The aircraft bouncing a couple of times in an uncontrolled way and after a loud noise, the right main landing gear collapsed. The crew was unable to maintain directional control of the aircraft because the wheels of the left main landing gear and engine No. 2 moved off the runway on the right side. The engine entered a drainage channel and separated. A fuel spill that ignited, reaching the aircraft that had already stopped.  The pilot simultaneously activated the three ""Engine Fire"" switches and ordered the evacuation of the aircraft from the left side. He ordered the co-pilot to leave the cockpit, as a large amount of smoke was entering. The crew proceeded with the emergency evacuation. No injuries were recorded among the occupants, but the aircraft was de	stroyed as a result of the fire. CAUSE (translated from Spanish) Failure of the mechanical components of the 'SHIMMY DAMPER - SD"" system in each of the main landing gears of the B737-3M8 aircraft, registration number OB2036P, which, being out of tolerance range, did not allow the correct damping of the vibrations and lateral oscillations of the wheels, generating sequential 'SHIMMY"" events in both gears, which resulted in their collapse and breakage, while landing at Francisco CarlÃ© de Jauja Airport CONTRIBUTING FACTORS 1) Incorrect and probable absence of measurements on mechanical components of the ""CIMATIC CHAIN FOR SD OPERATION"", as indicated by the operator's PM AMM Task, which would have allowed for the timely detection and replacement of out-of-tolerance components, ensuring their integrity and correct operation. 2) The Service Letter 737-SL-32-057-E ""BROKEN TORSION LINK"", does not provide for mandatory actions, it only recommends maintenance practices to prevent fractures in mechanical components of the ""CIMMETIC CHAIN FOR SD OPERATION"". 3) Service Letter 737-SL-32-057-E ""FRACTURES in LOWER Torsion Link"", makes a proper interpretation difficult; that could induce errors to choose the corresponding AMM Task and determine its scope.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIAA Report number: CIAA-ACCID-005-2017 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: CORPAC  El Comercio  portaldeturismo.pe   Location  Images: photo (c) AAIB; 28 March 2017 photo (c) Aeroprints.com; Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KUL/WMKK); 02 December 2004 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft originated from Leeds/Bradford Airport, U.K. at 08:13 UTC (09:13 LT). The crew consisted of the line supervising captain, the copilot and a line training captain, sitting in the observation seat, to evaluate the copilot for his completion of line training. The copilot was the aircraft's pilot flying (PF) during the whole route. The flight went smoothly and the crew carried out the final ILS Z approach manoeuvre for runway 10 at the Alicante-Elche Airport maintaining stabilized approach parameters as described in the operator's manual. Nine seconds after starting the landing flare manoeuvre, touchdown was made with a pitch attitude of 5Â°, a calibrated speed of 119 kt and a vertical descent speed of 240 fpm. There was a vertical acceleration of 1.45 G corresponding to a firm impact. The flare manoeuvre was considered slow, which the manufacturer identifies as a risk factor for tail strike. The position of the control column was slackened slightly after touchdown was made, but the pitch attitude tendency continued to increase until it reached a value of 10.2Â°, reaching a 1.14 G vertical acceleration value. This attitude was maintained for one second, causing the rear of the aircraft to strike the runway surface. After the tail area had struck the runway, the captain took control of the aircraft and continued the landing manoeuvre, completing it without any additional problems. The flight crew were unaware that the aircraft's tail area had touched the runway until they were informed at the parking area by one of the cabin crew that they had heard an unusual noise when landing. The aircraft suffered damage to the lower part of the tail cone. All the people on board disembarked normally without any medical attention being required. Causes / Contributing factors: The investigation has determined that the cause of the accident was incorrect pitch position control during landing. As a contributing factor, the fact that the aircraft captain (PM) could have intervened before the accident to correct the situation is highlighted.METAR: 10:00 UTC / 12:00 local time: LEAL 101000Z 09006KT 050V150 9999 FEW020 18/10 Q1026 NOSIG11:00 UTC / 13:00 local time: LEAL 101100Z 09006KT 050V150 9999 FEW020 18/10 Q1026 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIAIAC Report number: A-003/2017 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: CIAIAC   Location  Images: photo (c) Leslie Snelleman; Palma de Mallorca Airport (PMI/LEPA); 30 August 2015 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Mozart Airport (SZG/LOWS)","Bangor International Airport, ME (BGR/KBGR)"," UUS Austria","Accident investigation report completed and information captured","The Gulfstream G450 took off from Salzburg Airport, Austria, at 10:12, bound for Bangor International Airport, Maine, USA.  A few seconds after taking off from runway 33, the landing gear lever was selected to the Up position. About 20 seconds later, the crew discovered that the landing gear had not retracted. The landing gear remained in the Down & Locked position because the landing gear safety pins were set. The crew suspected that the safety pins were still set and decided to land back at Salzburg Airport, which was carried out on runway 15. After a flight time of about 5 minutes, the aircraft left the runway at about 10:17 on taxiway E. They were instructed by the control tower to taxi back to the parking area (apron).  The aircraft was stopped shortly after taxiing on taxiway E, as the crew noticed an increased rolling resistance of the aircraft, whereby the crew suspected a burst tyre. The crew decided to check directly at the taxiway whether the safety pins were still on the landing gear, to remove them if necessary and to check whether a tire was defective. The control tower of Salzburg Airport was not informed about this by the pilots. The co-pilot opened the cabin door and left the aircraft to perform these checks. Meanwhile, the pilot left the cockpit to inform the passengers in the cabin of the situation. At 10:20 and 10:22, the Salzburg Tower controller tried without success to make contact with the aircraft's crew. An aircraft passing taxiway L informed the controller about a person on the taxiway who had left the aircraft in question. The co-pilot, who had gone to the landing gear, recognized that the safety pins were installed and tried to remove them. When this attempt failed because hydraulic pressure was applied to the landing gear cylinder and the safety pin was jammed, he operated the landing gear door control valves of the nose and main landing gear several times and installed the landing gear doors control valve pins. This closed the landing gear doors, the main cylinders of the hydraulics of the main and nose landing gear were depressurized and the safety pins could be removed. After the co-pilot removed the nose landing gear door pin, the nose landing gear doors opened and the nose landing gear folded at about 10:30. The aircraft nose lowered and hit the taxiway. 5 to 10 seconds later the engines were switched off. No indication could be found that both the Landing Gear Failure to Retract and the Attempted Landing Gear Retraction with Safety Pins Installed Checklist were executed from the time the installed Safety Pins were detected until the time of the accident. Probable causes - Incomplete execution of the Preflight Checklist, thus forgetting the safety pins installed in the landing gears. - No knowledge or execution of the checklists for Landing Gear Failure to Retract or the Attempted Landing Gear Retraction with Safety Pins Installed. Thus, incorrect operation of the landing gear system and, as a result, failure to properly reset the landing gear to a defined system state. Probable Factors - Lack of ""REMOVE BEFORE FLIGHT"" flags on landing gear safety pins. Consequently, more difficult to detect deployed fuse pins.  - Collusion between pilots on the insertion or non-insertion of the securing pins, although insertion is mandatory by the manufacturer for parking and towing. - Very extensive Exterior Preflight Inspection Checklist for daily flight operations with 136 inspection points, which tempts to simplify the checklist for daily operations to a few important inspection points, which is not permissible from a safety, operational and certification point of view. - Gradual increase in psychological stress, characterized by communication difficulties, lack of knowledge of systems and procedures, time pressure and psychophysiological stress. - Breaking the logic of landing gear system operation for pilots because despite 3 green downlock indicators and landing gear lever in DOWN position on a GIV-X (G450), the landing gear can retract on the ground due to incorrect and improper operation of the landing gear system. The selector valve of the landing gear thus remained in a position not directly visible to the pilots.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: UUS Austria Report number: BMVIT-85.245 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) Rudolf Schider; Salzburg-W.

Correia International Airport for Mahdia Airstrip. The aircraft was programmed to do a series of shuttles to various airstrips in the Region 8 area. The accident flight was the second shuttle between Mahdia and Kopinang. The previous flight was normal. For the second shuttle, the aircraft was loaded with one passenger and cargo for a flight to Kopinang Airstrip. The aircraft departed Mahdia at 11:12 hrs local time with an estimated flying time of 24 minutes. As the aircraft approached Kopinang, rain was observed over the airstrip. This caused the pilot to hold for about 10-15 minutes East of the field to allow the rain to pass. The aircraft landed, but during the landing roll the wheels locked up. The brakes were modulated, and the flaps were raised but the aircraft did not stop. The pilot then moved the mixture controls to shutoff and steered the aircraft left towards a playfield. This was occupied and he turned the aircraft right, into a construction site that was located off the end of the usable portion of the runway. The aircraft stopped in the construction area. The right hand main landing gear broke off and the nose landing gear was bent. Cause: This accident was caused because the aircraft could not be stopped, after landing, within the usable portion of the runway. Contributory Factors: 1. The decision to land, without making a proper assessment of the runway conditions. 2. The wetness of the runway, which prevented effective braking.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: GCAA-AIT Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: demerarawaves.com  stabroeknews.com History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  29 January 2015 8R-GAR Air Services Limited 0 Kurupung Airport, Region 7 min Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

On board the aircraft was one pilot, 1,225 kg of general cargo and 800 lbs of fuel. At 11:44 hours local time, in daylight conditions, the aircraft departed Tanahmerah and cruised at altitude of 7,000 feet. Estimate time arrival at Oksibil would be 12:24. At 12:12, when the aircraft position was about 45 NM north of Tanahmerah, the aircraft passed another Cessna 208B aircraft from the opposite direction from Oksibil to Tanahmerah. The Cessna 208B pilot advised to the pilot via radio that the PK-FSO aircraft was in sight. The pilot responded that the aircraft was maintaining 7,000 feet on direct route to Oksibil. The pilot failed to contact the Oksibil air traffic controller and failed to arrive at the destination. The airline's flight following officer received an emergency signal with a last recorded position of 6 NM north of Oksibil.  The next day the aircraft was found on a ridge of Anem Mountain at a height of 7100 feet. The aircraft was destroyed by impact forces and the pilot was fatally injured. The investigation learned that two days prior the occurrence, the pilot travelled on a night commercial flight. This might have resulted in a sleep disturbance during the window of circadian low and an increase of the potential of fatigue. There are indications that the pilot did not have the required adequate restorative sleep before he started flying on the accident day. Prior to the occurrence flight, the pilot had flown for 3 flight sectors, with total flight hour of 2 hours 55 minutes. The multiple take-offs and landings that day increased fatigue.  Based on the final flight track, the absence of voice communication, the weather condition permitting the pilot to identify the airport location and the aircraft wreckage, consistently indicated that there were no pilot activities to fly the aircraft after the last known pilot activities at about 29 Nm from Oksibil until impact. Colleagues of the pilot reported that he often smoked in the cockpit during the flight, looked sleepy and engaged the Terrain Inhibit switch which disabled the GA-EGPWS function while flying. This prevented any prior warning when the aircraft neared Anem Mountain. This known behavior was not reported to the Operation and Safety department, so no action could be taken. Contributing Factors: ""The possibility of the pilot being fatigue, physical and environment condition increased pilot sleepiness which might have made the pilot inadvertently falling asleep indicated by no pilot activity. The absence of GA-EGPWS aural alert and warning was unable to wake up the pilot.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSC Report number: KNKT.17.04.10.04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) NTSC; 13 km N of Oksibil Airport (OKL); April 2017 photo (c) Google Earth; 13 km N of Oksibil Airport (OKL); 12 April 2017 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight was cleared for approach and landing on runway 13.  In the final approach and landing phase moderate wind shear and moderate turbulence were encountered. The left crosswind and the tail wind encountered did not exceed the limits of the aircraft. After touchdown the aircraft veered off the left side of the runway and hit a barrier on one side of the runway nose-first, damaging its nose, left engine and wing. Findings related to probable causes: 1. The occurrence aircraft performed the final approach in left crosswind and landed with its nose yawing to the left. It was probably  affected by the clockwise horizontal wind shear on the runway and pilot's operation, the aircraft began drifting to the left after touching down. 2. As the aircraft was drifting to the left, the Captain had used right rudder to correct the deviation, and also pulled the power levers into the reverse range. According to the recorded engine data of torque and (reverse) power of both engines, it revealed that the Captain inadvertently pulled back the left power lever while he was intending to apply the right-turning differential power to assist him in correcting the left drift. It resulted in increasing the left reverse power and intensified the aircraftÂs left drifting tendency. 3. Though the Captain attempted to get the directional control of aircraft by increasing the right rudder input and the right wheel brake pressure, however he still kept increasing the reverse power of left engine to the maximum, not knowing that he was taking the wrong side. Consequently, the aircraft veered off the runway, hit the fence and caused aircraft substantial damage.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ASC Report number: ASC-AOR-18-03-002 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Focus Taiwan  ASC   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane was being operated as Flight 341 by Grant Aviation as a scheduled commuter flight. The pilot, the sole occupant, sustained fatal injuries. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the airplane's point of departure. Flight 341 departed Port Heiden Airport, Alaska, at 13:05, destined for Perryville Airport, Perryville, Alaska. Flight 341 originated at the King Salmon Airport, Alaska, with one passenger who disembarked at the Port Heiden Airport. The scheduled flight continued to the Perryville Airport, which was about 80 miles away, with 1,322 lbs. of mail and no passengers.  After an ELT signal of the aircraft was received, a search mission was initiated. At 17:30, the wreckage was located. The wreckage came to rest in deep snow at about 2,993 feet on the west face of a treeless, steep mountain in the Alaska Peninsula National Wildlife Refuge of the Aleutian Range. It is located about 500 feet from the top of the mountain ridge and partially submerged in the snow on its left side with the nose section under the snow pack. The fragmented wreckage was contained in an area of about 100 feet by 40 feet, on a heading of about 030 Â° magnetic, with the right wing separated and located about 40 feet forward of the main wreckage. The wings and fuselage sustained substantial damage.  At 12:39, an aviation special weather report (SPECI) from the Chignik Airport (the closest weather reporting facility) reported, in part: wind variable at 4 knots; visibility 10 statute miles, light rain; sky condition, overcast at 1,700 feet; temperature 39 Â° F, dewpoint 36 Â° F; altimeter, 29.51 inHg.

The flight was a regularly scheduled flight from Boston Logan Airport (BOS), Boston, Massachusetts, to the John F Kennedy International Airport (JFK), New York, New York.  There were no other injuries, and no damage to the airplane.  According to the flight attendant statements, the #3 flight attendant (FA) stated that because the ride was ""slightly bumpy,"" she remained seated for an additional 5 to 10 minutes after the cabin received the double chime indicating that the flight had passed 10,000 feet.  Once it seemed to have smoothed out, she stood up and began to prepare for cabin service. Shortly after standing up, the airplane shook violently and she was tossed off her feet and into the air and landed on her right ankle, ending up on the galley floor.  According to the flight crew statements, they had just completed a flight into BOS on a different airplane with nothing more than light turbulence on descent. Prior to the accident flight, the captain briefed the #1 FA that they had just flown in and didn't expect anything worse than light turbulence during climb out.  During climb out, the flight crew indicted they were in and out of the clouds and only experience light chop. The weather radar was on but ""was not painting anything."" Just prior to leveling off at 14,000 feet they encountered a strong jolt of turbulence and then received a call from the cabin about the #3 flight attendant injury. At the time of the turbulence, the fasten seatbelt sign was illuminated. The injured FA was assisted into a rear customer seat for the remainder of the flight with her foot elevated and ice applied. Because the injured FA was incapacitated, the #2 FA crewed the #3 FA position and a nonrevenue FA crewed the #2 FA position. The flight was met by emergency medical personnel and the FA was transported to a local hospital where she was diagnosed with a broken right ankle. Probable Cause: an inadvertent encounter with convective turbulence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA17CA111 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates15-Mar-2018 20:12 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

Both crew members suffered fatal injuries. The aircraft originated from Louisville International Airport, Kentucky at 05:41 hours.  As the flight neared Yeager Airport at an altitude of 9000 ft, the crew received the most recent ATIS report for the airport indicating wind from 080Â° at 11 knots, 10 miles visibility, scattered clouds at 700 ft agl, and a broken ceiling at 1300 ft agl. However, a special weather observation recorded about 7 minutes before the flight crew's initial contact with the approach controller indicated that the wind conditions had changed to 170Â° at 4 knots and that cloud ceilings had dropped to 500 ft agl. The approach controller did not provide the updated weather information to the flight crew and did not update the ATIS. The approach controller advised the flight crew to expect the localizer 5 approach, which would have provided a straight-in final approach course aligned with runway 5. The first officer acknowledged the instruction but requested the VOR-A circling instrument approach, presumably because the approach procedure happened to line up with the flight crew's inbound flightpath and flying the localizer 5 approach would result in a slightly longer flight to the airport.  However, because the localizer 5 approach was available, the flight crew's decision to fly the VOR-A circling approach was contrary to the operator's standard operating procedures (SOP). The minimum descent altitude (MDA) for the localizer approach was 373 ft agl, and the MDA for the VOR-A approach was about 773 ft agl. With the special weather observation indicating cloud cover at 500 ft agl, it would be difficult for the pilots to see the airport while at the MDA for the VOR-A approach; yet, the flight crew did not have that information. The approach controller was required to provide the flight crew with the special weather report indicating that the ceiling at the arrival airport had dropped below the MDA, which could have prompted the pilots to use the localizer approach; however, the pilots would not have been required to because the minimum visibility for the VOR-A approach was within acceptable limits. The approach controller approved the first officer's request then cleared the flight direct to the first waypoint of the VOR-A approach and to descend to 4000 ft. Radar data indicated that as the flight progressed along the VOR-A approach course, the airplane descended 120 feet below the prescribed minimum stepdown altitude of 1720 ft two miles prior to FOGAG waypoint. The airplane remained level at or about 1600 ft until about 0.5 mile from the displaced threshold of the landing runway. At this point, the airplane entered a 2500 ft-per-minute, turning descent toward the runway in a steep left bank up to 42Â° in an apparent attempt to line up with the runway. Performance analysis indicates that, just before the airplane impacted the runway, the descent rate decreased to about 600 fpm and pitch began to move in a nose-up direction, suggesting that the captain was pulling up as the airplane neared the pavement; however, it was too late to save the approach.  At 06:50, the airplane impacted the runway 5 centerline in a 22Â° left bank and 5Â° nose-down at an airspeed of about 92 knots. The airplane's left wingtip struck the pavement first, followed by the left main landing gear and left propeller. The fuselage impacted the pavement and the left wing separated from the airplane during the impact sequence. The airplane slid off the left side of the runway through the grass safety area and down a hill through trees, coming to rest about 380 feet left of the runway centerline and 85 ft below the runway elevation. Video and witness information were not conclusive as to whether the captain descended below the MDA before exiting the cloud cover; however, the descent from the MDA was not in accordance with federal regulations, which required, in part, that pilots not leave the MDA until the ""aircraft is continuously in a position from which a descent to a landing on the intended runway can be made at a normal descent rate using normal maneuvers."" The accident airplane's descent rate was not in accordance with company guidance, which stated that ""a constant rate of descent of about 500 ft./min. should be maintained."" Rather than continue the VOR-A approach with an excessive descent rate and airplane maneuvering, the captain should have conducted a missed approach and executed the localizer 5 approach procedure. No evidence was found to indicate why the captain chose to continue the approach; however, the captain's recent performance history, including an unsatisfactory checkride due to poor instrument flying, indicated that his instrument flight skills were marginal. It is possible that the captain felt more confident in his ability to perform an unstable approach to the runway compared to conducting the circling approach to land. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The flight crew's improper decision to conduct a circling approach contrary to the operator's standard operating procedures (SOP) and the captain's excessive descent rate and maneuvering during the approach, which led to inadvertent, uncontrolled contact with the ground. Contributing to the accident was the operator's lack of a formal safety and oversight program to assess hazards and compliance with SOPs and to monitor pilots with previous performance issues.""METAR: 10:30 UTC / 06:30 local time: KCRW 051030Z 17004KT 10SM FEW001 OVC005 14/13 A2940 RMK AO2 VLY FG T01390133 $10:54 UTC / 06:54 local time: KCRW 051054Z 23003KT 10SM FEW001 OVC005 14/13 A2941 RMK AO2 SLP952 VLY FG T0144013310:59 UTC / 06:59 local time: KCRW 051059Z COR 00000KT 10SM FEW001 OVC005 14/13 A2940 RMK AO2 VLY FG T01440133Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA17FA109 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: tristateupdate.com  flightaware.com   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Charleston-Yeager Airport, WV (CRW); 06 May 2017; (CC:by-nc-sa) photo (c) NTSB; Charleston-Yeager Airport, WV (CRW); 06 May 2017; (CC:by-nc-sa) photo (c) NTSB; Charleston-Yeager Airport, WV (CRW); 06 May 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Charleston-Yeager Airport, WV (CRW); 06 May 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Charleston-Yeager Airport, WV (CRW); 06 May 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Charleston-Yeager Airport, WV (CRW); May 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Charleston-Yeager Airport, WV (CRW); May 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Charleston-Yeager Airport, WV (CRW); May 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Charleston-Yeager Airport, WV (CRW); 05 May 2017 photo (c) NTSB; Charleston-Yeager Airport, WV (CRW); 05 May 2017 photo (c) NTSB; Charleston-Yeager Airport, WV (CRW); 05 May 2017 photo (c) Leslie Snelleman; East Midlands Airport (EMA/EGNX); 17 April 1983 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The crew also had limited time in flight to plan and brief the approach, as required by company policy, and did not conduct an approach briefing before attempting to land at TEB. Cockpit voice recorder data indicated that the  second-in-command (SIC) was the pilot flying (PF) from PHL to TEB, despite a company policy prohibiting the SIC from acting as PF based on his level of experience. Although the accident flight was likely not the first time that the SIC acted as PF, based on comments made during the flight. The PIC regularly coached the SIC from before takeoff to the final seconds of the flight. The extensive coaching likely distracted the PIC from his duties as PIC and pilot monitoring, such as executing checklists and entering approach waypoints into the flight management system. Collectively, procedural deviations and errors resulted in the flight crewÂs lack of situational awareness throughout the flight and approach to TEB. Because neither pilot realized that the airplaneÂs navigation equipment had not been properly set for the instrument approach clearance that the flight crew received, the crew improperly executed the vertical profile of the approach, crossing an intermediate fix and the final approach fix hundreds of feet above the altitudes specified by the approach procedure. The controller had vectored the flight for the instrument landing system runway 6 approach, circle to runway 1. When the crew initiated the circle-to-land maneuver, the airplane was 2.8 nautical miles (nm) beyond the final approach fix (about 1 mile from the runway 6 threshold) and could not be maneuvered to line up with the landing runway, which should have prompted the crew to execute a go-around because the flight did not meet the companyÂs stabilized approach criteria. However, neither pilot called for a go-around. The PIC, who had assumed control of the airplane at this point in the flight, continued the approach by initiating a turn to align with the landing runway. Radar data indicated that the airplaneÂs airspeed was below the approach speed required by company standard operating procedures (SOP). During the turn, the airplane stalled and impacted the ground in a right wing low and nose down attitude in an industrial area between Kero Road and Commerce Road in Carlstadt, New Jersey, 1000 m short of runway 01. A fire erupted and consumed the aircraft. Both crew members died in the accident. Probable Cause: ""The NTSB determines that the probable cause of this accident was the PICÂs attempt to salvage an unstabilized visual approach, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall at low altitude. Contributing to the accident was the PICÂs decision to allow an unapproved SIC to act as PF, the PICÂs inadequate and incomplete preflight planning, and the flight crewÂs lack of an approach briefing. Also contributing to the accident were Trans-PacificÂs lack of safety programs that would have enabled the company to identify and correct patterns of poor performance and procedural noncompliance and the FAAÂs ineffective SAS procedures, which failed to identify these company oversight deficiencies.""METAR: 14:52 UTC / 18:52 local time: KTEB 151852Z 35020G30KT 10SM SCT045 19/06 A297515:45 UTC / 19:45 local time: KTEB 151945Z 32015G32KT 10SM SCT045 19/04 A2975 RMK SMOKE ON APCHAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NTSB/AAR-19/02 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Flightaware  NBC  FAA  NorthJersey.com  Teterboro Learjet Crash Raises Questions about Crew Qualifications (Flying.com, 13 Feb 2018)   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Teterboro Airport, NJ (TEB); 15 May 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Teterboro Airport, NJ (TEB); 15 May 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) Google Earth, with ASN annotations; Teterboro Airport, NJ (TEB); 15 May 2017 photo (c) NTSB; Teterboro Airport, NJ (TEB); 15 May 2017 photo (c) NTSB; Teterboro Airport, NJ (TEB); 15 May 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) Paul Kanagie; Philadelphia International Airport, PA (PHL/KPHL); 15 May 2017 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft originated from the Conrad Maldives Rangali Island Resort at 08:08 hours local time. The co-pilot was Pilot Flying. The flight and approach to MalÃ© were uneventful. While landing the left float touched the water first, then the aircraft bounced and ballooned. It then landed on the left float for a second time, and bounced again. Then the aircraft was banking excessively to the right digging the right wing tip in the water, making the aircraft veer to the right. Then the aircraft crashed on water banking to the left with the left float digging into the water. After the accident the aircraft came to rest with the left hand wing touching the water with an apparently collapsed left hand float attachment. Causes: a. Improper recovery techniques from a bounced landing; application of go-around procedures whilst the aircraft was at low speed with flaps fully extended. b. Breakdown of crew coordination during the attempted go-around.METAR: 03:00 UTC / 08:00 local time: VRMM 280300Z 24014KT 9999 SCT018 BKN270 29/25 Q1010 NOSIG04:00 UTC / 09:00 local time: VRMM 280400Z 24014KT 9999 SCT018 BKN270 30/26 Q1010 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: AICC Maldives Report number: jan-17 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Sun.mv  raajje.mv   Location  Images: photo (c) Flightradar24; MalÃ©-Velana International Airport (MLE); 27 May 2017 photo (c) Leslie Snelleman; MalÃ© International Airport (MLE/VRMM); 10 January 2016 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft operated on a cargo charter flight with 1680 kg cargo on board. It took off from Kathmandu at 07:44 UTC at flight 409, bound for Lukla. It was the 5th flight of the aircraft to Lukla and with the same set of crew. Lukla weather was cloudy, but visibility and ceiling was reported to be fine after an hour of heavy rain. On first contact flight 409 reported abeam Rumjatar descending out of 11300 ft at 08:10 UTC. Lukla Tower provided the latest weather at the airport, as well as enroute weather relayed by 9N-AGU, an AS350 helicopter that had departed Lukla for Kathmandu. Almost 4 minutes after the first contact, Tower informed flight 409 about the deteriorating weather. The right base leg was covered by lifting fog though there was no rain and the final approach area was still visible. Weather deteriorated further and Tower regularly updated the flight crew. About 30 seconds after flight 409 reported entering valley, Lukla Tower again informed about the latest status of the further deteriorating weather. Flight 409 then informed that they would come up to Bhatkeko Daada and then decide. The pilot also informed they could see some bright spots. While continuing approach, both cockpit crew sighted the runway at 9100 ft. That was 64 seconds before the impact. While continuing approach the aircraft deviated to the right by almost 15 degrees and erroneously descended too low to 8500 ft whereas threshold height is 8900 ft (on Kathmandu QNH, whereas per AIP it is 9200 ft).  The flight crew attempted to climb and reach the threshold in a landing configuration. The aircraft pitched up to over 25Â°, the airspeed dropped and the aircraft stalled. Subsequently its left wing first hit a small tree and then impacted the sloping terrain 130 feet short of the runway. The captain and copilot both sustained fatal injuries. Probable Cause:  The Commission concludes that the probable cause of this accident was aircraft stall as a result of excessive drag created by sudden increase in angle of attack of the aircraft supplemented by low speed (below Vref) in an attempt to initiate immediate climb on a landing configuration (full flap and landing gear down) warranted by the critical situation of the final phase of flight. The contributing factors for the accident are: a. Critical terrain and rapidly deteriorating weather condition. b. Pilot's loss of situational awareness c. Improper pilot response to stall warning including failure to advance power lever to maximum at appropriate time. d. Voilation of SOP by the ATS and Pilot as well.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Nepal AAIC Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Kathmandu Post  Hemant Arjyal  My Republica  The Himalayan Times History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  2 June 2015 9N-AKY Goma Air 0 Pokhara Airport (VNPK), Pokhara, Kaski, Gandaki min Location  Images: photo (c) Eckhard SchlÃ¶der; Lukla-Tenzing-Hillary Airport (LUA); 04 January 2017 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight was uneventful since the first departure from Makassar until commencing the approach at Manokwari. At 08:15 hours local time, the aircraft departed Sorong to Manokwari. On board were two pilots, four flight attendants and 146 passengers. On this flight, the Second in Command (SIC) acted as Pilot Flying (PF) and the Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as Pilot Monitoring (PM). At 08:31, the pilot made first contact with the Rendani Tower controller and informed that the aircraft was descending from FL230 and requested weather information. The Rendani Tower controller informed the pilot that the wind was calm, ground visibility 6 km, cloud FEW CB 1,400 feet, temperature and dew point 26/25Â°C. At 08:36, Rendani Tower instructed to the pilot to descend to 11,000 feet and to report when on Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC). At 08:38, the pilot informed that they were in VMC and passing altitude 13,000 feet at 32 NM from the ZQ NDB (Non-Directional Beacon). The Rendani Tower controller instructed to fly overhead, descend to circuit altitude, join right downwind runway 35, and to report when overhead Manokwari. At 08:44, the pilot reported that the aircraft was over Manokwari and the Tower controller informed the pilot that the visibility had changed to 5 km. Two minutes later Rendani Tower instructed the pilot to continue approach and to report on right base runway 35. At 08:49, at approximately 600 feet, the PIC as PM took over control by called ""I have control"" and the SIC replied ""You have control"". A few seconds later the pilot reported that the aircraft was on final runway 35, and Rendani Tower instructed to the pilot to report when the runway 35 in sight. The pilot immediately replied that the runway was in sight, which was acknowledged by Rendani Tower who then issued landing clearance with additional information that the wind was calm and the runway condition wet. At approximately 550 feet, the PIC instructed the SIC turn on the wiper and reconfirmed to SIC that the runway was in sight. Between altitude 500 feet to 200 feet, the EGPWS aural warnings ""Sink Rate"" and ""Pull Up"" sounded. At 08:50, the aircraft touched down on runway 35. The spoilers deployed and the pilot activated the thrust reversers. The crew did not feel significant deceleration. The aircraft failed to stop on the runway and overran by approximately 20 meters from the end of runway pavement. After the aircraft stopped, the PIC commanded ""Evacuate"" through the Passenger Address (PA) system. The Rendani Tower Controller saw that the aircraft had overrun, activated the crash bell and then informed the Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) that there was an aircraft overrun after landing on runway 35. All the flight crew and passengers evacuated the aircraft and transported to the terminal building safely. The aircraft sustained serious damage on the nose landing gear, nose section lower fuselage, and both engine fan blades.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSC Report number: KNKT.17.05.17.04 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: Celebes Online  Antara History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  18 April 2008 PK-CJC Sriwijaya Air 0 Pangkalpinang Airport (PGK/WIPK) min Runway excursion Location  Images: photo (c) NTSC; Manokwari-Rendani Airport (MKW); 31 May 2017 photo (c) NTSC; Manokwari-Rendani Airport (MKW); 31 May 2017 photo (c) NTSC; Manokwari-Rendani Airport (MKW); 31 May 2017 photo (c) NTSC; Manokwari-Rendani Airport (MKW); 31 May 2017 photo (c) NTSC; Manokwari-Rendani Airport (MKW); 31 May 2017 photo (c) Muhamad Gabriel Miolo; Bandar Lampung-Branti Airport (TKG/WICT); 22 April 2017 photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Jakarta-Soekarno-Hatta International Airport (CGK/WIII); 14 April 2014 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The ten occupants were not injured, but the aircraft was substantially damaged. The aircraft was on a sales trip to Mongolia at the time of the accident. Eight passengers were due to be taken on a flight out of Ulan Bator. The aircraft was fueled with 950 kg of fuel. Flaps were set at 20Â°, according to the crew, and the aircraft was cleared for takeoff from runway 32. After lifting off the runway, the aircraft went into an immediate climb and flaps were retracted at an altitude of 40-50 m. Shortly afterwards the aircraft pitched up and entered a right bank with increasing roll rate. The aircraft lost altitude and impacted terrain between the runway and the taxiway. The right main gear and lower and upper right wings impacted the ground first, causing the undercarriage and wings to collapse.  The TVS-2MS was an Antonov 2T that was converted in 2013 with a TPE331 turbine engine instead of the original Shvetzov ASH-62IR radial piston engine. Conclusion: The aircraft accident with UEMOB RA-2099G took place because of its entering the stall mode during takeoff with the values of weight and alignment exceeding the established limits. The actual value of alignment at takeoff was 37% with a 33% limit.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: MAK   Location  Images: photo (c) MAK; Ulan Bator-Chinggis Khaan International Airport (ULN); 02 June 2017 photo (c) Aleksandr Markin; 10 June 2014 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft departed Saltillo Airport at 21:27 on a non-scheduled cargo flight to Puebla, Mexico, carrying a total of 550 kgs of cargo. The captain was Pilot Flying, the copilot was Pilot Monitoring. Prior to departure the flight was supposed to have been refueled with about 2000 lbs of fuel. However, the flight took off without having been refueled and with just 700 lbs of fuel in the tanks. At 22:27 hours the flight declared a fuel emergency to the Mexico City ACC controller. The crew decided to divert to Tampico.  Upon their request, the flight was cleared for an approach to runway 31. On final approach the aircraft hit trees and force landed, coming to rest about 850 meters from the runway threshold. The aircraft sustained substantial damage.

During the landing rollout, the aircraft overshot the end of the runway, eventually hitting a rainwater drainage ditch located approximately 70 meters from the threshold. The aircraft had substantial damage. The two pilots and three passengers were unharmed. Contributing factors. - Application of commands - contributed. Flight controls were not adequately used to correct the variations presented during final to landing, leading to increased speed and long touchdown on the runway. - Cabin coordination - undetermined. It is possible that the aircraft weight for landing and Vref were not part of the descent/approach briefing as per the company's Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), having the potential to generate information conflicts on board the aircraft. - Airport infrastructure - contributed. The aircraft crashed into a masonry drainage ditch for rainwater located in the Runway End Safety Area (RESA). This area was supposed to be clean and level and provide safety for aircraft operating at the airfield if one of them touched down before reaching the headland or accidentally overshot the end of the runway. - Pilotage Judgment - contributed. It was considered that, despite being on a non-stabilized approach, a safe landing would be possible. Likewise, the distance required for landing in the conditions that presented themselves was not taken into consideration. - Perception - contributed. The landing in disagreement with the predicted parameters for a stabilized approach denoted a low level of crew situational awareness of factors that could affect the execution of the task and compromise flight safety. The night VFR flight in a mountainous area and with few light references on the ground may have contributed to a reduced perception of the final approach parameters. - Decision making - contributed. The landing, despite the non-stabilized approach and the possibility of a go-around, was based on an inadequate assessment of the existing conditions, contributing to the accident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CENIPA Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: CENIPA  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates15-Sep-2020 08:15 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...
