The aircraft was then prepared for Crossair flight 498 to Dresden. Germany. Taxi clearance was given at 17:50 and the crew taxied to runway 28. The crew expected to be cleared for a standard instrument departure SID ZUE 1Y. This procedure calls for the aircraft to climb straight ahead heading 280 and then make a left turn to cross overhead the airport at the KLO VOR and then assume a heading of 054Â° onto airway R234 to the Zurich East (ZUE) beacon. At 17:54 the aircraft was cleared for takeoff. Takeoff and climb were conducted with flaps at 0 degrees, which is normal for a Saab 340 departing from runway 28. The aircraft climbed normally at 136 knots IAS. After retracting the gear the Flight Director was switched on. While climbing through 2500 feet QNH the crew switched to Zurich Departure Control and were recleared to climb to FL110. At 17:55 the crew were cleared to make a left turn to intercept airway R234. A left turn was initiated, during which the first officer entered a command in the Flight Management System (FMS) to ZUE. The command ""direct to (DTO) Â left Â ZUE"" however was programmed only as ""direct to Â ZUE"". The programming was performed by the first officer alone, without the prescribed monitoring and checking by the captain. The latter was absorbed in manually flying the aircraft.  After having turned left for 7 seconds the captain started a right turn, consistent with Flight Director commands generated by the FMS for a 'direct to ZUE' as the right hand turn was the shortest.  In clouds the aircraft continued a right roll, which at 17:56:14 reached a right bank angle of 65.8Â°. The first officer advised the captain that the aircraft should actually turn to the left. This was also noted by the Zurich departure controller at 17:56:20, who asked the crew about the direction of the turn. The first officer replied: ""Moment please, stand by"". Upon which the Departure controller recleared the flight to continue the right turn direct to ZUE. By then the pitch had also decreased rapidly, accompanied by a marked speed increase and the Saab entered a high speed high-rate spiral descent. At 17:56:28 the aircraft crashed in an open field. Weather reported included temperature 2deg C; dew point 1deg C; 1032 mB wind WNW/3 knots and light drizzle. CAUSES: ""The accident is attributable to a collision with the ground, after the flight crew had lost control of the aircraft for the following reasons: - The flight crew reacted inappropriately to the change in departure clearance SID ZUE 1Y by ATC. - The co-pilot made an entry in the FMS, without being instructed to do so by the commander, which related to the change to the SID ZUE 1 standard instrument departure. In doing so, he omitted to select a turn direction. - The commander dispensed with use of the autopilot under instrument flight conditions and during the work-intensive climb phase of the flight. - The commander took the aircraft into a spiral dive to the right because, with a probability bordering on certainty, he had lost spatial orientation. - The first officer took only inadequate measures to prevent or recover from the spiral dive. The following factors may have contributed to the accident: - The commander remained unilaterally firm in perceptions which suggested a left turn direction to him. - When interpreting the attitude display instruments under stress, the commander resorted to a reaction pattern (heuristics) which he had learned earlier. - The commanderÂs capacity for analysis and critical assessment of the situation were possibly limited as a result of the effects of medication. - After the change to standard instrument departure SID ZUE 1Y the crew set inappropriate priorities for their tasks and their concentration remained one-sided. - The commander was not systematically acquainted by Crossair with the specific features of western systems and cockpit procedures.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BFU Switz.

The descent from FL70 was started at 14:25. Eleven minutes later both engines flamed out. The aircraft was ditched off the Libyan coast in a 10deg nose up attitude. The tail broke off and the wreckage sank inverted to a depth of 38 m, about 3 miles from the coast.  According to the Libyan investigation report, the first officer and co-pilot, who both survived, were so busy talking about how to fly the Fokker F-28 aircraft that they failed to switch on the anti-icing system for the engines as weather conditions deteriorated. As the aircraft came in to land, ice that had been allowed to build up melted, flooding the engines and cutting off the power. A device that might have restarted the engines was not switched on. There were no lifejackets on board and many of the dead drowned because they were unaware that their seat cushions doubled as floats.

The aircraft had a full load of passengers which meant that there would be little time for the cabin crew to carry out full service program on the shorter than normal flight.  After departure the seat belt sign remained on for approximately five minutes due to turbulence in the climb-out. Ten minutes before landing, when the commander turned on the ""fasten seat belt sign"", two cabin attendants were standing in the aft galley stowing their service carts. One cabin attendant was leaning slightly forward to lock a cart in place when the aircraft was through about in the turbulence. She flew up in the air and landed on the floor on her back with the right leg under her. She received help during the remainder of the flight and was then brought to hospital.  After examination in the hospital it was determined that she had suffered three fractures in her right ankle. Conclusion Turbulence was experienced during the flight. The sudden severe shaking that was felt caused the C/A to lose her balance and fall, breaking her ankle. Contributing to the accident onboard was the fact that the short flight time provided little opportunity for the cabin attendants to complete the normal service program for a fully seated flight and then be seated with their seat belts fastened in good time prior to the landing. SHK considers that the need for serving a complete service program on short flights in turbulent weather can be questioned from a safety point of view.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: SHK Report number: RL 2000:17e Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: ICAO  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates19-Sep-2024 05:54 ASN Added 19-Sep-2024 06:20 ASN Updated [Operator, Location, Departure airport, Destination airport, Narrative, Category, Accident report, ] Corrections or additions? ...

During the descent and vectors for the approach to runway 31R at Love Field, the airplane began to accumulate moderate clear ice, and a master warning light illumination in the cockpit indicated that the horizontal stabilizer heat had failed. The crew continued the approach to get the airplane out of the icing conditions and on the ground as soon as possible. Considering the possibility of additional ice accumulation on the horizontal stabilizer, the crew, per the flight manual abnormal procedures checklist, configured the airplane for a touchdown speed of 120 knots in lieu of 108 knots, and a flap extension of 10 degrees in lieu of 30 degrees. The aircraft touched down approximately 1,500 feet down the runway and the captain began applying the brakes. The captain reported that the aircraft did not have any braking action for approximately 3,000 feet and the anti-skid was not pulsing. With about 1,500 feet of runway remaining, it looked to the captain like there would not be enough available runway to stop the aircraft. Beyond the departure end of the runway, there was a steep down hill embankment and support poles for the approach lights for runway 13L. The captain forced the aircraft to depart the right side of the runway to avoid the poles. After the aircraft started down the embankment, the nose gear collapsed and the airplane came to rest. The wreckage was sold to Dodson International Parts and was last seen at their Rantoul, KS scrapyard in September 2005.

The crew initiated their descent at a 'later than normal distance' from the airport, and as a result, a power reduction below 25 percent torque was required, which set off the gear warning horn.  The sound 'eventually became part of the background noise.'  During the approach, the captain asked the tower to dim the runway lights.  At that time, the runway and approach lights went out and the crew lost sight of the runway.  While the captain was asking the tower to turn the lights back on, the first officer called 'gear down, syncs off, speeds high, below the line check list.'  The captain did not hear the first officer's callout and did not lower the landing gear.  The captain stated that he did not hear the first officer's callout 'either because of the conversation [he] was having with the tower or because of the intercom system difficulties.'  As the approach continued, the first officer had a problem slowing the airplane to proper approach speed.  The airplane touched down on the runway with the landing gear retracted, 'slid' about 2,500 feet and exited the left side of the runway. Probable Cause: The flight crew's failure to extend the landing gear.  Contributing factors were the flight crew's non-compliance with the checklist, the pilot-in-command's diverted attention as a result of the loss of instrument approach/runway lighting, the partial failure of the instrument approach/runway lighting system, and the partial failure of the intercom system.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: FTW00LA078 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB FTW00LA078 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates16-Oct-2022 05:46 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

Flight KQ430 departed from Nairobi for a flight to Lagos and Abidjan. Due to the harmattan, a dusty seasonal wind from the deserts of north Africa, the flight continued directly to Abidjan. The aircraft, named ""Harambee Star"", landed there at 15:15 local time.  The Airbus was prepared for the return flight, KQ431, to Lagos and Nairobi that evening. Shortly after 21:00 the crew received clearance to taxy to runway 21 for departure. The trim was set at 0.9 nose up, slats and flaps at 15 degrees. The airplane began to taxi at 21:07, the tower controller informed the crew of the latest wind, cleared them to take off and asked the crew the call back when they reached flight level 40. At 21:08:18, the captain, who was pilot non flying, applied takeoff power and announced ""thrust, SRS, and runway"" then, nine seconds later ""100 knots"". Flight 431 took off and at 21:08:57, the copilot announced ""Positive rate of climb, gear up"". Less than two seconds later, at a height of around 300 feet, the stall warning sounded. The gear was not retracted. The copilot, who was the pilot flying, pushed forward on the control column in reaction to the stall warnings. At 21:09:07, the copilot asked, ""What's the problem?"" The aircraft descended and less than a second before passing through 100 feet in descent, the copilot ordered the aural stall warning alarm to be disconnected. The GPWS sounded briefly, followed by the CRC (Continuous Repetitive Chime), which corresponds to a master warning of over-speed with flaps extended, immediately followed by an order from the captain ""Go up!"". The airplane's speed at this point was at least 210 knots, the maximum speed limit for a configuration with slats/flaps at 15Â°/15Â°. At 21:09:24 the airplane contacted the sea and broke up. The wreckage came to rest on the sandy seabed at a depth of 40-50 metres. Just ten of the 179 occupants survived the accident. CAUSES OF THE ACCIDENT:  ""The Commission of Inquiry concluded that the cause of the accident to flight KQ 431 on 30 January 2000 was a collision with the sea that resulted from the pilot flying applying one part of the procedure, by pushing forward on the control column to stop the stick shaker, following the initiation of a stall warning on rotation, while the airplane was not in a true stall situation. In fact, the FCOM used by the airline states that whenever a stall warning is encountered at low altitude (stick shaker activation), it should be considered as an immediate threat to the maintenance of a safe flight path. It specifies that at the first sign of an imminent stall or at the time of a stick shaker activation, the following actions must be undertaken simultaneously: thrust levers in TOGA position, reduction of pitch attitude, wings level, check that speed brakes are retracted. The investigation showed that the pilot flying reduced the pitch attitude but did not apply TOGA thrust on the engines. The investigation was unable to determine if the crew performed the other two actions: leveling the wings and checking that the speed brakes were retracted. The following elements contributed to the accident: - the pilot flying's action on the control column put the airplane into a descent without the crew realizing it, despite the radio altimeter callouts; - the GPWS warnings that could have alerted the crew to an imminent contact with the sea were masked by the priority stall and overspeed warnings, in accordance with the rules on the prioritization of warnings; - the conditions for a takeoff performed towards the sea and at night provided no external visual references that would have allowed the crew to be aware of the direct proximity of the sea.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CoI Ivory Coast Report number: Report 5y-n000130 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 12 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: ICAO Adrep Summary 2/00 (#4)   Location  Images: photo (c) Commission of Inquiry; near Abidjan; 30 January 2000 photo (c) Sarah Ward; London-Heathrow Airport (LHR); 1987 photo (c) Peter Frei; ZÃ¼rich-Kloten Airport (ZRH); 08 August 1992 photo (c) Reinhard Zinabold, via Werner Fischdick; Amsterdam-Schiphol Airport (AMS); September 1999 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates02-Jan-2025 09:06 ASN Updated [Phase, Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Flight AS261 departed Puerto Vallarta at about 14:30 PST for a flight to San Francisco and Seattle. En route to San Francisco a FL310 a problem arose with the stabilizer trim. At 16:10 the crew radioed Los Angeles ARTCC that they were having control problems and that they were descending through FL260. At 16:11 Los Angeles ARTCC asked the condition of the flight and were told that they were troubleshooting a jammed stabilizer. The crew requested, and were granted, a FL200-FL250 block altitude clearance. At 16:15 the crew were handed off to Los Angeles sector control. The Alaska Airlines crew reported problems maintaining their altitude and told their intentions to divert to Los Angeles International Airport. They were cleared to do so at 16:16. The crew then requested permission to descend to FL100 over water to change their aircraft configuration . Los Angeles cleared them to FL170. Last message from Flight 261 was when they requested another block altitude. The request was granted at 16:17, without a readback from the crew. During the descent the crew was also talking to Alaska Airlines maintenance personnel in Seattle and Los Angeles to troubleshoot their stabilizer trim problems. As the crew attempted to diagnose or correct the problem the out-of-trim condition became worse, causing a tendency for the plane to pitch nose-down. When preparing the plane for landing control was lost and the MD-83 was seen 'tumbling, spinning, nose down, continuous roll, corkscrewing and inverted'. The aircraft crashed off Point Mugu in 650 feet deep water. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""A loss of airplane pitch control resulting from the in-flight failure of the horizontal stabilizer trim system jackscrew assemblyÂs acme nut threads. The thread failure was caused by excessive wear resulting from Alaska AirlinesÂ insufficient lubrication of the jackscrew assembly. Contributing to the accident were Alaska AirlinesÂ extended lubrication interval and the Federal Aviation AdministrationÂs (FAA) approval of that extension, which increased the likelihood that a missed or inadequate lubrication would result in excessive wear of the acme nut threads, and Alaska AirlinesÂ extended end play check interval and the FAAÂs approval of that extension, which allowed the excessive wear of the acme nut threads to progress to failure without the opportunity for detection. Also contributing to the accident was the absence on the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 of a fail-safe mechanism to prevent the catastrophic effects of total acme nut thread loss.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NTSB/AAR-02-01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) U.S. Department of Defense; off Point Mugu, CA photo (c) NTSB; off Point Mugu, CA; 2000; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; off Point Mugu, CA photo (c) NTSB; off Point Mugu, CA photo (c) Marlo Plate; Los Angeles International Airport, CA (LAX); August 1999 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates02-Jan-2025 09:08 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

After takeoff the captain forgot to retract the gear (the floats-equipped Caravan has wheels installed on the floats) The flight to Filitheyo was conducted at FL45. On approaching Filitheyo Seaplane Base, the captain realized that the GPS position fed to the system was that of the resort island (Filitheyo), not the GPS position of the landing site near Filitheyo resort (Dhiguvaru Falhu) which is about 2.5 miles (4 km) north of Filitheyo. The captain, until he was about to land was busy in correcting the GPS co-ordinates for the landing site. On landing on water the aircraft sprung back and the captain realized that the landing gear was down. The aircraft bounced back and flipped onto its back pivoting the nose and left wing. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The investigation concludes that the primary cause of the accident was pilot error.

When it went dark en route to Mwanza, the radio altimeter integral light was found to be unserviceable. The crew were not able to fix the problem and the continued using the FMS. The crew contacted Mwanza tower at 16:58 and were being advised that there was no power at the airport and that efforts were being made to use a standby generator. Further information passed on the crew reportedly included VOR, DME and NDB all unserviceable, weather: wind calm, 8 km visibility, temperature 25deg C and QNH 1015. After holding for 10 minutes, the airport generator came on and the runway lights went on. The first officer, who was pilot flying, started a visual runway 12 approach. When well established on finals with full landing configuration, the captain told the f/o that he was too low, and a few seconds later he told the f/o he was too high. Both the captain and the flight engineer then told the f/o to go around. The f/o overshot and climbed to 5500 feet on the downwind leg. Turning on the left base the captain remarked that the turn was too tight: "".. I will do a 360-degree turn to the right and position you finals"". The captain thus took over control and started a right turn at 4400 feet. Just before completing the turn, the f/o said: ""do not go down anymore, the altimeter is reading 4100 feet"". Almost aligned with the runway, the f/o took over control again. At that same moment the aircraft bounced 2 or 3 times yawing to the left and came down to a halt in the middle of the lake.Sources: AIB Bulletin 1/00  Aviation Week & Space Technology 06.03.2000  Graham Tanner  ICAO Adrep Summary 2/00 (#24)  NTSB  Panafrican news Agency  Tommy Maurer   Location  Images: photo (c) unknown; Mwanza Airport (MWZ); February 2000 photo (c) unknown; Mwanza Airport (MWZ); February 2000 photo (c) unknown; Mwanza Airport (MWZ); February 2000 photo (c) unknown; Mwanza Airport (MWZ); February 2000 photo (c) unknown; Mwanza Airport (MWZ); February 2000 photo (c) unknown; Mwanza Airport (MWZ); February 2000 photo (c) unknown; Mwanza Airport (MWZ); February 2000 photo (c) unknown; Mwanza Airport (MWZ); February 2000 photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Miami International Airport, FL (MIA); February 1993 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The same flight crew flew the airplane from Atlanta to El Salvador and back to Atlanta.  Another flight crew boarded the airplane and continued on to Los Angeles.  No discrepancies were reported by either of the flight crews or maintenance personnel in El Salvador and Atlanta.  After the airplane arrived in Los Angeles, a post flight walk around inspection revealed that the outside of the fuselage buckled on the left side above the nose landing gear door.  Further examination disclosed that structural members were bent and fractured in the nose wheel well.  The crew that landed in El Salvador stated that the nose gear touched down more firmly than the main landing gear.  They completed a post flight inspection, but detected no abnormalities.  The flight data recorder was removed and sent to the Safety Board's Vehicle Recorder Laboratory for readout and evaluation.  A Safety Board specialist conducted a data comparison for the landings in El Salvador, Atlanta, and Los Angeles.  In the El Salvador landing sequence, the air/ground FDR discrete indicated ""air"" then a second later indicated ""ground.""  A second later it indicate ""air"" again and then a second later indicated ""ground"" and remained ""ground"" for the remainder of the landing roll out.  During this phase, a right roll angle developed, while the pitch angle and control column movements were more pronounced than on the other landings.  For the Atlanta and Los Angeles landings, the air/ground discrete indicated ""air"" then a second later indicated ""ground"" and remained ""ground.""

During the approach for landing, when the landing gear was selected down, the main gear indication showed that the left main gear had not fully lowered. The crew checked the electrical and hydraulic systems but no fault was found. They also reported that after a fly-past of the control tower, the air traffic controller advised that the gear appeared down and locked. The crew then cycled the gear up then down and it lowered normally with the indication showing the gear down and locked. The landing at Dili was made without further incident. The flight engineer reported that he inspected the landing gear after landing at Dili and found no faults in the landing gear system. He said that he suspected that a micro switch might have been the cause of the indication. The aircraft operator did not have any maintenance personnel stationed at Dili and the crew did not report the problem to the operator's maintenance organisation. The aircraft returned to Darwin the next day. At about 1000 (CST), while the aircraft was on approach to Darwin airport, the crew lowered the landing gear. The nose and right main gear indicators showed that the respective gear was down and locked but the left main gear position indicator showed unsafe. Still suspecting an indication problem, the crew raised and lowered the landing gear several times, but the left main gear indicator continued to show an unsafe condition. The crew conducted a fly-past of the control tower and the controller confirmed that the left main gear was not down. Having confirmed that the nose and right main landing gear operated correctly and that the left main landing gear would not move, the pilot in command allocated flying duties to the copilot. The pilot in command and flight engineer conducted the checklist actions and attempted to lower the gear using the emergency procedures. The attempt to lower the gear hydraulically by using the landing gear override selector valve was unsuccessful. An attempt to lower the gear using the manual drive failed because the emergency engaging handle could not be moved. The flight engineer unsuccessfuly attempted to manually move the shift lever on the forward gearbox of the left landing gear from ""power"" to ""manual"" and the loadmaster then attempted to lower the gear by disconnecting the universal joints on the vertical torque shafts of the left landing gear. However, the castellated nuts on the bolts of both wheel vertical torque shaft universal joints could not be undone without using a spanner. Even using a spanner, only two of the four nuts had been undone after about 30 minutes. At about 1020, the crew of a C5 Galaxy military cargo aircraft also inbound to Darwin advised air traffic control that their aircraft was experiencing a hydraulic problem. Twenty minutes later, the crew of the Hercules informed air traffic control that the aircraft would be making a gear-up landing. The pilot in command requested that the airport's Rescue and Fire Fighting Service (RFFS) lay a foam path along the last two thirds of Runway 36. The air traffic controller informed the crew that a landing on Runway 29 was preferred and that the L-382 was number two in the ""emergency landing sequence"". Air traffic control intended that the Galaxy land first followed by the Hercules. The air traffic controller later informed the Hercules crew that the airport RFFS advised that laying foam was not standard procedure. The controller also advised that if foam was laid, no foam would be available to attend the aircraft after it landed. The pilot in command was concerned about the potential for fire caused by sparks during the landing and he requested a clearance from air traffic control to perform the landing on the grass alongside the runway. By the time two of the nuts on each of the universal joints had been undone, the fuel state of the Hercules was approaching 1,500 lbs or about 20 minutes endurance. The pilot in command decided that due to the low fuel state, there was insufficient time to undo the remaining nuts before a landing was required and he advised the controller of the aircraft's low fuel state. Concerned at the chances of the aircraft slewing off the runway after touchdown, the pilot in command also decided that the nose and right main landing gear would be raised for the landing. The Hercules was cleared to track for final approach Runway 29. The Galaxy diverted to the Royal Australian Air Force Base at Tindal. The pilot in command subsequently decided that it would be more prudent to land on the runway because of possible obstructions on the grass area. After briefing the passengers, the crew conducted their own emergency briefing, including actions after touchdown, shutdown actions, and evacuation routes. The pilot in command assumed control of the aircraft during final approach and conducted the gear up landing. At 1104, the Hercules landed on Runway 29. Touchdown was made at approximately 90 kts and the aircraft slid about 300 metres before stopping adjacent to Taxiway D. The aircraft remained straight on the runway and none of the crew or passengers were injured. They evacuated the aircraft soon after it came to rest. Although a flash fire erupted at the rear lower fuselage area while the aircraft slid along the runway, the fire did not spread. The RFFS applied foam to the area around the aircraft after it came to a halt.Sources: https://www.atsb.gov.au/publications/investigation_reports/2000/aair/aair200000618  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates19-Sep-2024 05:54 ASN Added 19-Sep-2024 07:00 ASN Updated [Time, Location, Nature, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The aircraft lost its number 1 and 2 engine cowlings on takeoff from Seattle. Following the separation of the cowlings, the flight returned to Seattle-Tacoma International and landed without further incident. There were no injuries. Post-accident inspection of the aircraft revealed substantial damage to the aircraft's left wing and left horizontal stabilizer.  The aircraft maintenance log indicated that on the previous flight (from Anchorage to Seattle, arriving at 07:18), the flight crew had written up discrepancies that the number 2 engine would not go into reverse thrust, and that the captain's course deviation indicator (CDI) was frozen. The frozen captain's CDI was determined to be a non-deferrable, Aircraft-on-Ground (AOG) item. There was also a deferred maintenance item (DMI) on the number 1 thrust reverser. Due to concerns expressed by the captain of the incoming flight about the operability of the thrust reversers in consideration of icy runway conditions at Anchorage, maintenance also decided to lube, inspect, and check all four thrust reversers for proper operation. One mechanic working on the number 2 thrust reverser asked the mechanic working on the number 1 thrust reverser to finish up the aircraft and close all engine cowls, since he had already worked over three hours overtime.  The mechanic who worked on the number 1 thrust reverser, and who was asked by the first mechanic to close all engine cowls, reported that he lowered the number 1 and 2 cowling doors, but that he and another mechanic were unable to secure and lock the doors. He stated that about 16:00, they returned to the shop for assistance in locking and securing the cowling doors. He stated that at that time, he entered in the turnover log that all four cowling doors required securing, and also verbally reported this to two other mechanics from the next shift.  One of the company mechanics who took the turnover report on the cowl doors from the first-shift mechanic stated that at about 1530, he received a tie-in from that mechanic (the one assigned to the number 1 thrust reverser) that all cowlings on N811CK needed to be closed. He noted that the cowlings for the number 1 and number 2 engines were closed and that those for the number 3 and 4 engines were wide open. He assisted in closing the number 3 engine cowl, but did not check the number 1 or number 2 cowlings to ensure that they were secured.  The captain reported that his first indication of any problems was at rotation, when the number 2 engine N2 (high pressure section) RPM indication went to zero and the number 2 engine generator light came on. He stated he also noticed the aircraft roll left slightly at that time. The captain reported that he and his crew were diagnosing the problem when the control tower called and notified him that his aircraft had left debris on the runway during takeoff. The captain stated that he then called company headquarters in Ypsilanti, Michigan, and decided to return to Seattle-Tacoma International.  The flight engineer reported that the cowlings were closed when he arrived at the aircraft, that he observed no abnormalities during the exterior preflight inspection. The number 1 and 2 engine cowls completely departed the aircraft during the accident sequence. Several cowl sections were found on the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport runway; two cowling sections were also found in a residential area in the Browns Point area of Tacoma, Washington, approximately 10 nautical miles south-southwest of the airport. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""Inadequate inspection of the number 1 and 2 engine cowls by company maintenance personnel and inadequate preflight inspection by the flight engineer, resulting in unsecured cowls separating from the aircraft during takeoff.

The flight took place normally, without any abnormalities until the moment of landing. The weather conditions of the destination were poor with rain, strong wind with gusts and windshear indications in the vicinity of the airport. The aircraft performed the NDB ECHO 2 approach for runway 29. During the landing, the aircraft floated over the runway, touching down approximately 1000 meters past the threshold. After the touchdown, the aircraft ran for about 1400 metres before it suffered a runway excursion and collided with a ditch. The aircraft suffered severe damage. Contributing factors a. Human Factor (1) Physiological Aspect - Did Not Contribute (2) Psychological Aspect - Contributed From the knowledge of the prevailing weather conditions, it was possible for pilots to predict the possibility of ""windshear"" in the aerodrome area. In the meantime, they proceeded to land in compliance with the company's operational standards. b. Material Factor - No contribution c. Operational Factor (1) Adverse Weather Conditions - Contributed Adverse meteorological phenomena, with regard to the tailwind component, cross wind  and heavy rain, substantially interfered with the operation of the aircraft in the landing phase, leading to abnormal circumstances and loss of ground control. (2) Poor Infrastructure - Contributed The meteorological information reported to the aircraft was being obtained from measuring points located in the control tower, and not in the vicinity of the runway.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CENIPA Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Zero Hora   Location  Images: photo (c) FÃ¡bio LuÃ­s Fonseca; Porto Alegre - Salgado Filho; 28 February 2000 photo (c) FÃ¡bio LuÃ­s Fonseca; Porto Alegre - Salgado Filho; 28 February 2000 photo (c) FÃ¡bio LuÃ­s Fonseca; Porto Alegre - Salgado Filho; 28 February 2000 photo (c) Ricardo Chaves/Zero Hora; Porto Alegre - Salgado Filho; 27 February 2000 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

At the same time, the flight engineer was reconfiguring the airplane's electrical system from a Category III landing to a Category I landing.  When the flight engineer closed the ""number one bus-tie-breaker,"" the airplane experienced an uncommanded pitch-up, accompanied by numerous momentary instrument failures.  Twelve occupants were injured.  The airplane was utilizing the ""A"" autopilot system, which remained engaged.  The pilot disconnected the autopilot, leveled the airplane, re-engaged the autopilot, and continued to an uneventful landing.  During a ferry flight, maintenance personnel were able to duplicate a ""sudden pitch-up"" while using the airplane's ""B"" autopilot system, and closing the ""number two bus-tie-breaker."" Additionally, the flight crew reported that the airplane ""felt light in pitch.""  Examination of data obtained from the flight data recorder and optical quick access recorder revealed an electrical discontinuity around the time of the pitch-up. An inspection of the airplane revealed that the number 1 and 2, elevator feel computer pitot connections were capped.  Review of the airplane's maintenance history revealed that the airplane had recently undergone an ""inter 2 check"" at a British Airways maintenance facility.  During that time, maintenance personnel disconnected the pitot connections to the elevator feel computer in order to perform pitot static system checks.  The effect of the disconnected pitot-static lines on the elevator feel computer would have resulted in a more extreme travel of the elevator control surface.  The calculated expected autopilot elevator authority for the accident flight was about 4 degrees.  The estimated actual elevator deflection during the accident sequence was 6.87 degrees nose up, and 6.97 degrees nose down.  Review of the Boeing basic airplane maintenance manual section that detailed the pitot-static system checks revealed a test to confirm that the elevator feel computer was reconnected and functioned.  The test was not present the maintenance manual utilized by British Airways, which was provided by Boeing.  The source of the pitch-up command to the autopilot was not determined; however, when the autopilot system was properly configured, the pitch-up characteristics were not objectionable and within expected values. Probable Cause: Maintenance personnel's failure to reconnect the pitot connections to the elevator feel computer which resulted in an elevator control surface deflection which was outside of the normal autopilot elevator authority.  The uncommanded autopilot input to the elevator control surface resulted from an undetermined electrical source.  A factor in this accident was that the section of the 747 Maintenance Manuel utilized by company maintenance personnel did not contain an ""elevator feel light test.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NYC00LA085 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB NYC00LA085 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates03-May-2024 10:26 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

The ILS approach to runway 18 (6,299 x 150 feet, contaminated with ice, and -.611% gradient) at Jackson Hole Airport was performed with a 6.5 knot tailwind.  During the landing roll, the captain used the emergency braking system, which deactivated the anti-skid protection.  At mid-field, the airplane slid left, then slid right, and then left back to the runway centerline where the captain said he continued braking.  The airplane continued beyond the end of the runway for 160 feet into snow approximately 2 feet deep.  The manufacturer's Airplane Flight Manual indicates that when emergency braking is utilized, the anti-skid protection is deactivated.  The CVR recorded a 'high pitch' sound at 0839:44, which was the high-pressure air of the emergency braking system being activated.  The Airplane Flight Manual also limits landing on contaminated runways to the following: A. Winds must be zero or a headwind of less than 30 knots (i.e. no tailwind); B. The runway gradient must be between -1% and  2.2%; and C. The anti-skid system must be operational. Probable Cause: The pilot not following the airplane manufacturer's recommended landing procedures for a contaminated runway by landing with a tailwind.  Factors were the pilot's inadvertent deactivation of the anti-skid protection, the ice contaminated runway, and the snow covered terrain beyond the runway.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DEN00LA057 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DEN00LA057 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates16-Oct-2022 04:17 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

The first segment of the flight from Lagos (LOS) to Abuja (ABV) was flown by the Commander. The aircraft departed Lagos about 06:30 hours UTC and initially at cruise, the crew had a momentary problem setting power on the starboard engine after which the flight continued normally to Abuja.  The aircraft which departed Abuja for Jos (JOS) at 09:00 hours UTC first officer at the controls. At FL 90 and about 30NM from Abuja, the crew again had problems with the cruise power setting on the starboard engine. The torque remained at 1400. The crew retarded the right power lever to the minimum with the aim of achieving a cruise setting of 1300 but the gear warning came on. The Commander at this stage took over the controls from the first officer. At 09:23 hours UTC, the aircraft contacted Kaduna Tower that it would be diverting to Kaduna (KAD) giving its flight level as 90 at a distance of 61 miles and estimating TMA at 24 miles, 'KC' at 41 miles, 6 souls on board and 5 hours endurance at departure. The tower then gave the aircraft an inbound clearance to 'KC' locator maintaining FL 90 and to expect no delay for a locator approach runway 05. Weather report at 09:00 hours UTC was also passed to the aircraft as wind 090/05 knots, QNH 1014 and temperature 30Â°C. At 09:28 hours UTC the airplane at about 42 miles, speed between 150-160 kts, requested descent and was cleared to 4,500ft, QNH 1014. At about 09:35 hours UTC, the pilots contacted tower that they would make a single engine approach because they were having problems controlling power on the starboard engine and it would be shut down.  The commander then reviewed the single engine approach with the first officer estimating 4,500 ft at 8NM. Approaching 4,500 ft at 11 NM, the crew initiated right engine shut down after which the speed was decayed from 150 to 140 kts. At 09:46 hours UTC, the pilot reported 6nm final and field in sight while the tower requested him to report 4 miles final. The controller reported having the aircraft in sight and subsequently cleared it to land on runway 05 giving wind as north easterly 06 knots. Descending at 500ft/min, the commander requested for 25% of flap when the first officer selected full flap. When the aircraft was at 2,700 ft high, the speed had already decayed to between 100 - 110 kts. The crew applied full power on the port engine to arrest the speed decay but to no avail. The pilot was trying to correct the descent rate, speed decay and the asymmetry when the stall warning came on.  The aircraft belly landed and struck the new VOR/DME site being constructed about 1175 m from the threshold of runway 05. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The probable cause of this accident was the poor handling by the crew of the one-engine inoperative approach.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIPB Report number: 04/375 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources: ICAO Adrep File : 00000870   Location  Images: photo (c) AIPB Nigeria; Kaduna Airport (KAD); March 2000 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The ice strip on the lake was 2700 feet approximate in length, 150 feet wide. The aircraft was observed to touch down nearly halfway along the ice strip, the tail of the aircraft remained in the air, and the aircraft took off almost immediately. The main landing gear was seen to retract. The aircraft reached the end of the runway then abruptly entered a steep, nose-up attitude, banked sharply to the left, turned left, and descended into the ice. The left wing made first contact with the ice. The aircraft rotated around the left wing and struck the ice in a steep, nose-down attitude about 400 feet from the end of the ice strip. FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: - The pilot lost control of the aircraft while conducting a go-around from a balked landing on an ice strip. - The aircraft's centre of gravity (C of G) on the accident flight was beyond the aft C of G limit. - The actual C of G of the aircraft at basic operating weight was 16.7 inches aft of the C of G provided in the weight and balance report. - The load sheet index number used by the crew was inaccurate. - The stack of 2x4 lumber was inadequately secured and may have shifted rearward during the go-around. - The crew did not recalculate the aircraft's weight and balance for the second flight. - Leaks in the heater shroud allowed carbon monoxide gas to contaminate cockpit and cabin air. - The captain's carboxyhaemoglobin level was 17.9 per cent, which may have adversely affected his performance, especially his decision making and his visual acuity.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: TSB Report A00C0059 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Both crewmembers said they never saw the tug until after the collision, and when the aircraft door was opened, they realized that the baggage vehicle had collided with their aircraft. The police report showed that the pilot had said in his initial report, that he felt as if the left wing had been pushed hard and he had observed that the aircraft's left propeller and wing, as well as the rear baggage carts were damaged. The police report also showed that the baggage cart had been equipped with no lights, only reflectors, and that the distance from the center of the yellow taxi line to the impact point where the debris lay was about 30 feet. In addition, a ramp control incident report showed that in addition to the debris being located 30 feet from the yellow line, the debris was also located 73 feet from the aircraft containment line. The tug driver stated that he had been driving as close to the fuchsia (red) line as was possible, when the collision occurred. The ramp supervisor who was marshalling the aircraft and witnessed the collision stated that he was 100 feet away, and observed that the tug and cart was coming from the left side of the aircraft, trying to cross the taxiway from one side to the other, and the tug driver did not notice the aircraft taxiing in, and tried to avoid hitting the aircraft by making a turn to the left, but he hit the airplane with the cart, causing damage to the airplane's left wing and propeller.

Prior to starting the approach, the flightcrew determined that the landing approach speed (Vref) and the approach speed (Vapp) were 122 and 128 knots, respectively. The airplane flying on autopilot passed the middle marker at 200 feet AGL at 130 knots on the ILS approach. Approximately 3 seconds after the first officer called ""runway in sight twelve o'clock,"" the captain disconnected the autopilot, while at a radio altitude of 132 feet and on a heading of approximately 18 degrees. Within approximately 11 seconds after the autopilot disconnect, the glideslope and localizer deviation increased. The first officer called ""runway over there.""

The departure and en route portions of the flight to Fox Harbour were unremarkable until preparation for the descent. The owner of the IAI Astra jet had made it clear to this crew, and to other crews on previous occasions, that he expected arrivals and approaches to be flown in minimum time. The operating crew and other employees confirmed this pressure, and aircrew therefore planned and conducted their operations accordingly. In preparation for the arrival and the approach to Fox Harbour, the crew inserted a series of waypoints in the flight management system to guide them for a straight-in approach and landing on runway 33. In general, the descent was flown at high speed on a track following the navigation waypoints programmed in the flight management system by the crew. Speed brakes were required to slow the aircraft during the descent. Example speeds show that the aircraft was at 340 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS) at 10 000 feet, 310 KIAS at 5000 feet, and 250 KIAS at 1000 feet. At 1000 feet, the aircraft was levelled and decelerated to configure for approach and landing. About this time, there was a slight quartering tailwind component, estimated to be about six knots. Because the speed was high throughout the descent, flaps and landing gear selections were delayed and, consequently, not fully extended until about three miles from the runway. At this time, the co-pilot went ""heads down"" to ensure that all checklist items were complete and to confirm that the aircraft was properly configured to land. When he next looked up, he observed that the aircraft was low in relationship to the runway and advised the captain, who corrected by levelling the aircraft. The aircraft altitude was recorded on radar to be between 200 and 300 feet above sea level while tracking inbound to the airport. A short distance before the tree line the aircraft began descending again. The co-pilot saw trees between the aircraft and the runway and called for an overshoot. The captain had begun the overshoot on the co-pilot's call; however, the action was not taken in time to avoid striking the trees. About 50 feet above ground level and 1300 feet from the threshold of runway 33, the aircraft struck the trees and descended 10 feet into the treetops, then climbed away. Damage to the aircraft comprised wing leading-edge dents, minor fuselage perforations, leading- and trailing-edge flap dents and perforations, nose and landing-gear door damage, and foreign object damage to both engines. Tree debris was entangled in the landing gear; some of this debris fell from the aircraft during the overshoot. Debris that entered the engines subsequently resulted in an odour of burning wood and some smoke in the cabin. Once the aircraft began climbing on the overshoot, the crew raised the landing gear and the trailing-edge flaps. Both systems functioned normally. The initial decision to raise the landing gear and the flaps was re-examined during the overshoot climb, resulting in the leading-edge flaps being left extended. The crew contacted air traffic control on the overshoot, declared an emergency, and requested clearance to Charlottetown. Charlottetown was chosen because it was nearby and clearly visible from Fox Harbour, had landing aids, and had airport emergency response services. The aircraft continued to Charlottetown for a straight-in approach and an uneventful landing and shutdown. FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1. Conditions conducive to black-hole illusion were present during the night approach to the runway. 2. In this situation, the crew did not recognize the potential hazard of the black-hole illusion and therefore did not compensate for it. 3. The crew did not adhere to the required standard operating procedures for the preparation and execution of the approach. Consequently, the crew were inadequately prepared for the visual conditions on final approach. FINDINGS AS TO RISK: 1. The high descent and intermediate approach speeds caused cockpit pre-landing checks to be delayed. This delay resulted in the co-pilot's attention being diverted inside the cockpit when approach monitoring should have been done. 2. The crew's decision to raise the landing gear and the flaps on the overshoot after hitting the trees increased the risk to the flight.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A00A0051 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: TSB Report Number A00A0051 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  5 February 2010 C-FRJZ Jetport Inc. 0 In flight near Hamilton, Ontario min Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

It landed in Bangkok-Don Muang International Airport (BKK), Thailand after an uneventful flight. The same flight crew made the return flight back to Colombo after 4 hours and 20 minutes ground time in Bangkok. The crew had received the weather report prior to departure. The aircraft was refueled adding 6681 kg of fuel to the remaining 8300 kg bringing the total fuel onboard to 14981 kg. Flight SCB 702 departed Bangkok. The scheduled flight time for Bangkok - Colombo was five hours and twenty minutes with a scheduled time of arrival of 17:00 hours. SCB 702 made the first radio contact with Sri Lanka air traffic control at 16:16. The area controller passed SCB702 the latest weather report effective for Colombo. At 16:40 the controller radioed: ""There is a sigmet valid up to 1415 UTC, Colombo FIR CBs, Thunderstorms were found having tops up to FL360 over Sri Lanka including Colombo and Ratmalana airfields and now contact Colombo Director on 132.4 Mhz."" When the crew contacted the approach radar controller (Director) they were asked to report the radial and DME from Colombo, (i.e. from ""DVOR/DME KAT""). SCB 702 reported as saying ""074 radial and 55 DME ready for descent"". Later, flight SCB 702 made two unsuccessful ILS approaches to runway 04. While on a radar heading to get established on the ILS to runway 22 for a third attempt to land, all four engines stopped. The propellers were feathered and the aircraft entered a controlled glide. It cut through several coconut trees before crashing on the houses. The left wing had separated first. The right wing then separated as well. Both wings lost all engines in the process.  There had been two isolated minor fires where the main wing tank and the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) were found. Both the fires had not spread to other areas and had extinguished on its own. CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT: The aircraft accident occurred due to fuel starvation. Contributory factors to the accident are as follows. i) Violation of Air Navigation Regulations on fuel planning; ii) Failure of the flight crew to declare an emergency; iii) Being unable to land due to adverse weather situation; iv) Lack of communicability of the flight crew in English language; v) Non-availability of established air traffic control procedures to assist an aircraft in distress; vi) Failure of Skycabs (Pvt.)

No injuries reported to the passengers and crew (exact numbers of passengers and crew not reported).  ""Towards the end of the taxi out to the hold for Runway 9R, which was reported to have been conducted at speeds no higher than 9 knots, the crew heard a loud bang and felt a slight âbumpâ. Almost immediately all of the anti-skid warning lights associated with the right wing landing gear illuminated on the flight deck. About this time a passenger informed the cabin crew that he had seen a tyre roll from under the aircraft across the grass, between the taxiway and the runway.  The aircraft stopped at the holding point and was duly inspected by airport personnel. It was evident that the inboard rim of the No 2 wheel (front inboard wheel of the left wing landing gear) had completely detached from the wheel and this had allowed the tyre to come off. After wheels Nos 1 and 2 had been changed, the aircraft was towed back to the gate where the passengers disembarked normally"" Further examination of the aircraft revealed that fragments of the failed inboard rim had been jettisoned by the released inboard wall of the tyre and caused impact damage to the right main gear door, the right wing landing gear and its folding door. In addition, a wiring conduit which was mounted on the right wing gear drag brace, and contained the anti-skid units wiring, had been severed in two places.

The captain advised the first flight attendant to expect turbulence.  He turned on the fasten seat belt sign, and he directed that cabin service be suspended and the service carts stowed.  The first flight attendant notified the other flight attendants of the captain's instructions.  She stated that she directed them to ""stop service and take their seats immediately.""  The flight attendants secured the cabin, which took a few minutes. However, they had not taken their seats when the airplane encountered several jolts of moderate turbulence.  The airplane's flight data recorder indicated that within a 1/2-second period the vertical acceleration changed from -0.05G to  2.37Gs.  The first flight attendant (front cabin) was knocked off her feet.  The three flight attendants in the aft galley were thrown upward but did not strike the ceiling before coming back down and falling to the floor.  One was seriously injured.  The operator's ""InFlight Operations Manual"" required the flight crew to use standard terminology during briefings to the flight attendants.  The descriptive terms include usage of the words ""light, moderate, or severe"" when describing expected turbulence.  Neither the captain nor any of the flight attendants reported having used/heard these terms regarding the anticipated turbulence intensity.

CAUSE: During a non-scheduled commercial flight, during landing, the aircraft deviated to the left of the runway and one of the blades of the No. 1 propeller impacted a beacon, due to an inadequate sequence in the activation of the engine controls and propeller pitch.Sources: http://www.jiaac.gob.ar/files/pdf/Bol30.pdf  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates23-May-2023 21:28 harro Updated Corrections or additions? ...

Flight 541 departed Manila (MNL) at 05:21 hours and was due to land at Davao (DVO), Philippines, around 06:45.  The aircraft was being flown as a route check for a captain. Another captain was acting as Pilot Monitoring on the flight. The en route part of the flight was uneventful. The aircraft was conducting an ILS approach to runway 05 and the controller reported that they would be behind Philippine Airlines flight 809, an Airbus A319. As the Boeing 737 broke out of clouds, the A319 was observed on runway 05. The Pilot Flying informed ATC of his intention to perform a 360Â° maneuver, but the Pilot Monitoring advised ATC of the opposite, stating that the aircraft would turn right instead of following the missed approach procedure, which called for a left hand turn to a 020Â° heading. The aircraft re-entered clouds and attempted to fly visually at a lower altitude in instrument conditions when in fact it should have climbed to 4000 feet.  The flight continued over Samal Island and the flight requested a VOR/DME approach and landing in the opposite direction (runway 23), which was approved by the controller. After having aligned with the runway heading, the aircraft descended below the normal glide path for this approach. It continued down to 570 feet at a point where the aircraft should have been at 1500 feet. The aircraft crashed into a coconut plantation on a hillside in Barangay San Isidro, disintegrated and caught fire.Sources: AP  ICAO Adrep  Nolan News, Fall 08  Philippine Daily Inquirer  The Philippine STAR   Location  Images: photo (c) Erik Oxtorp, via Werner Fischdick; Manila-Ninoy Aquino International Airport (MNL); June 1999 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates05-Jan-2025 19:52 ASN Updated [Narrative, ]10-Feb-2025 07:40 ASN Updated The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The 3-man cockpit crew, 11-person cabin crew, and 220 passengers were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. An instrument flight rules flight plan had been filed for the flight, between Newark and Brussels Airport (BRU), Belgium.  Startup and taxi were normal, and during the taxi, the captain again briefed the cockpit crew, and included engine failures, as well as ""non-reject"" situations. The airplane lined up on runway 04L, and the captain applied takeoff power slowly and smoothly. At takeoff decision speed (V1), there was a loud explosion. A white ""engine fail"" light illuminated in front of the captain, and the number 1 engine N1 decreased by 30 percent. Number 2 and number 3 engines appeared normal.  The captain continued the takeoff, and the landing gear was raised. A red, left main landing gear warning light illuminated on the front panel. The airplane turned to a heading of 010, and slowly climbed to 3,000 feet. During the climb, an airframe vibration developed.  After level-off, the crew began to troubleshoot the emergency, and found that when the number 3 engine N1 was reduced, the vibration disappeared. Both the number 1 and the number 3 engines remained at reduced power, in relation to number 2, for the rest of the flight.  Air traffic control personnel provided vectors for a return to Newark. During the return, the crew dumped about 90,000 pounds of fuel. The crew also ran both 1-engine, and 2-engine inoperative checklists, and prepared data cards for both scenarios.  The captain flew the ILS glideslope down to a full-stop landing, on runway 04R at 20:16. After stopping on the runway, the brakes would not release, so the crew shut down the engines, and the passengers and crew disembarked through the normal deplaning doors. The airplane was later towed to a ramp.

The aircraft was then prepared for Crossair flight 498 to Dresden. Germany. Taxi clearance was given at 17:50 and the crew taxied to runway 28. The crew expected to be cleared for a standard instrument departure SID ZUE 1Y. This procedure calls for the aircraft to climb straight ahead heading 280 and then make a left turn to cross overhead the airport at the KLO VOR and then assume a heading of 054Â° onto airway R234 to the Zurich East (ZUE) beacon. At 17:54 the aircraft was cleared for takeoff. Takeoff and climb were conducted with flaps at 0 degrees, which is normal for a Saab 340 departing from runway 28. The aircraft climbed normally at 136 knots IAS. After retracting the gear the Flight Director was switched on. While climbing through 2500 feet QNH the crew switched to Zurich Departure Control and were recleared to climb to FL110. At 17:55 the crew were cleared to make a left turn to intercept airway R234. A left turn was initiated, during which the first officer entered a command in the Flight Management System (FMS) to ZUE. The command ""direct to (DTO) Â left Â ZUE"" however was programmed only as ""direct to Â ZUE"". The programming was performed by the first officer alone, without the prescribed monitoring and checking by the captain. The latter was absorbed in manually flying the aircraft.  After having turned left for 7 seconds the captain started a right turn, consistent with Flight Director commands generated by the FMS for a 'direct to ZUE' as the right hand turn was the shortest.  In clouds the aircraft continued a right roll, which at 17:56:14 reached a right bank angle of 65.8Â°. The first officer advised the captain that the aircraft should actually turn to the left. This was also noted by the Zurich departure controller at 17:56:20, who asked the crew about the direction of the turn. The first officer replied: ""Moment please, stand by"". Upon which the Departure controller recleared the flight to continue the right turn direct to ZUE. By then the pitch had also decreased rapidly, accompanied by a marked speed increase and the Saab entered a high speed high-rate spiral descent. At 17:56:28 the aircraft crashed in an open field. Weather reported included temperature 2deg C; dew point 1deg C; 1032 mB wind WNW/3 knots and light drizzle. CAUSES: ""The accident is attributable to a collision with the ground, after the flight crew had lost control of the aircraft for the following reasons: - The flight crew reacted inappropriately to the change in departure clearance SID ZUE 1Y by ATC. - The co-pilot made an entry in the FMS, without being instructed to do so by the commander, which related to the change to the SID ZUE 1 standard instrument departure. In doing so, he omitted to select a turn direction. - The commander dispensed with use of the autopilot under instrument flight conditions and during the work-intensive climb phase of the flight. - The commander took the aircraft into a spiral dive to the right because, with a probability bordering on certainty, he had lost spatial orientation. - The first officer took only inadequate measures to prevent or recover from the spiral dive. The following factors may have contributed to the accident: - The commander remained unilaterally firm in perceptions which suggested a left turn direction to him. - When interpreting the attitude display instruments under stress, the commander resorted to a reaction pattern (heuristics) which he had learned earlier. - The commanderÂs capacity for analysis and critical assessment of the situation were possibly limited as a result of the effects of medication. - After the change to standard instrument departure SID ZUE 1Y the crew set inappropriate priorities for their tasks and their concentration remained one-sided. - The commander was not systematically acquainted by Crossair with the specific features of western systems and cockpit procedures.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BFU Switz.

The descent from FL70 was started at 14:25. Eleven minutes later both engines flamed out. The aircraft was ditched off the Libyan coast in a 10deg nose up attitude. The tail broke off and the wreckage sank inverted to a depth of 38 m, about 3 miles from the coast.  According to the Libyan investigation report, the first officer and co-pilot, who both survived, were so busy talking about how to fly the Fokker F-28 aircraft that they failed to switch on the anti-icing system for the engines as weather conditions deteriorated. As the aircraft came in to land, ice that had been allowed to build up melted, flooding the engines and cutting off the power. A device that might have restarted the engines was not switched on. There were no lifejackets on board and many of the dead drowned because they were unaware that their seat cushions doubled as floats.

The aircraft had a full load of passengers which meant that there would be little time for the cabin crew to carry out full service program on the shorter than normal flight.  After departure the seat belt sign remained on for approximately five minutes due to turbulence in the climb-out. Ten minutes before landing, when the commander turned on the ""fasten seat belt sign"", two cabin attendants were standing in the aft galley stowing their service carts. One cabin attendant was leaning slightly forward to lock a cart in place when the aircraft was through about in the turbulence. She flew up in the air and landed on the floor on her back with the right leg under her. She received help during the remainder of the flight and was then brought to hospital.  After examination in the hospital it was determined that she had suffered three fractures in her right ankle. Conclusion Turbulence was experienced during the flight. The sudden severe shaking that was felt caused the C/A to lose her balance and fall, breaking her ankle. Contributing to the accident onboard was the fact that the short flight time provided little opportunity for the cabin attendants to complete the normal service program for a fully seated flight and then be seated with their seat belts fastened in good time prior to the landing. SHK considers that the need for serving a complete service program on short flights in turbulent weather can be questioned from a safety point of view.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: SHK Report number: RL 2000:17e Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: ICAO  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates19-Sep-2024 05:54 ASN Added 19-Sep-2024 06:20 ASN Updated [Operator, Location, Departure airport, Destination airport, Narrative, Category, Accident report, ] Corrections or additions? ...

During the descent and vectors for the approach to runway 31R at Love Field, the airplane began to accumulate moderate clear ice, and a master warning light illumination in the cockpit indicated that the horizontal stabilizer heat had failed. The crew continued the approach to get the airplane out of the icing conditions and on the ground as soon as possible. Considering the possibility of additional ice accumulation on the horizontal stabilizer, the crew, per the flight manual abnormal procedures checklist, configured the airplane for a touchdown speed of 120 knots in lieu of 108 knots, and a flap extension of 10 degrees in lieu of 30 degrees. The aircraft touched down approximately 1,500 feet down the runway and the captain began applying the brakes. The captain reported that the aircraft did not have any braking action for approximately 3,000 feet and the anti-skid was not pulsing. With about 1,500 feet of runway remaining, it looked to the captain like there would not be enough available runway to stop the aircraft. Beyond the departure end of the runway, there was a steep down hill embankment and support poles for the approach lights for runway 13L. The captain forced the aircraft to depart the right side of the runway to avoid the poles. After the aircraft started down the embankment, the nose gear collapsed and the airplane came to rest. The wreckage was sold to Dodson International Parts and was last seen at their Rantoul, KS scrapyard in September 2005.

The crew initiated their descent at a 'later than normal distance' from the airport, and as a result, a power reduction below 25 percent torque was required, which set off the gear warning horn.  The sound 'eventually became part of the background noise.'  During the approach, the captain asked the tower to dim the runway lights.  At that time, the runway and approach lights went out and the crew lost sight of the runway.  While the captain was asking the tower to turn the lights back on, the first officer called 'gear down, syncs off, speeds high, below the line check list.'  The captain did not hear the first officer's callout and did not lower the landing gear.  The captain stated that he did not hear the first officer's callout 'either because of the conversation [he] was having with the tower or because of the intercom system difficulties.'  As the approach continued, the first officer had a problem slowing the airplane to proper approach speed.  The airplane touched down on the runway with the landing gear retracted, 'slid' about 2,500 feet and exited the left side of the runway. Probable Cause: The flight crew's failure to extend the landing gear.  Contributing factors were the flight crew's non-compliance with the checklist, the pilot-in-command's diverted attention as a result of the loss of instrument approach/runway lighting, the partial failure of the instrument approach/runway lighting system, and the partial failure of the intercom system.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: FTW00LA078 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB FTW00LA078 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates16-Oct-2022 05:46 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

Flight KQ430 departed from Nairobi for a flight to Lagos and Abidjan. Due to the harmattan, a dusty seasonal wind from the deserts of north Africa, the flight continued directly to Abidjan. The aircraft, named ""Harambee Star"", landed there at 15:15 local time.  The Airbus was prepared for the return flight, KQ431, to Lagos and Nairobi that evening. Shortly after 21:00 the crew received clearance to taxy to runway 21 for departure. The trim was set at 0.9 nose up, slats and flaps at 15 degrees. The airplane began to taxi at 21:07, the tower controller informed the crew of the latest wind, cleared them to take off and asked the crew the call back when they reached flight level 40. At 21:08:18, the captain, who was pilot non flying, applied takeoff power and announced ""thrust, SRS, and runway"" then, nine seconds later ""100 knots"". Flight 431 took off and at 21:08:57, the copilot announced ""Positive rate of climb, gear up"". Less than two seconds later, at a height of around 300 feet, the stall warning sounded. The gear was not retracted. The copilot, who was the pilot flying, pushed forward on the control column in reaction to the stall warnings. At 21:09:07, the copilot asked, ""What's the problem?"" The aircraft descended and less than a second before passing through 100 feet in descent, the copilot ordered the aural stall warning alarm to be disconnected. The GPWS sounded briefly, followed by the CRC (Continuous Repetitive Chime), which corresponds to a master warning of over-speed with flaps extended, immediately followed by an order from the captain ""Go up!"". The airplane's speed at this point was at least 210 knots, the maximum speed limit for a configuration with slats/flaps at 15Â°/15Â°. At 21:09:24 the airplane contacted the sea and broke up. The wreckage came to rest on the sandy seabed at a depth of 40-50 metres. Just ten of the 179 occupants survived the accident. CAUSES OF THE ACCIDENT:  ""The Commission of Inquiry concluded that the cause of the accident to flight KQ 431 on 30 January 2000 was a collision with the sea that resulted from the pilot flying applying one part of the procedure, by pushing forward on the control column to stop the stick shaker, following the initiation of a stall warning on rotation, while the airplane was not in a true stall situation. In fact, the FCOM used by the airline states that whenever a stall warning is encountered at low altitude (stick shaker activation), it should be considered as an immediate threat to the maintenance of a safe flight path. It specifies that at the first sign of an imminent stall or at the time of a stick shaker activation, the following actions must be undertaken simultaneously: thrust levers in TOGA position, reduction of pitch attitude, wings level, check that speed brakes are retracted. The investigation showed that the pilot flying reduced the pitch attitude but did not apply TOGA thrust on the engines. The investigation was unable to determine if the crew performed the other two actions: leveling the wings and checking that the speed brakes were retracted. The following elements contributed to the accident: - the pilot flying's action on the control column put the airplane into a descent without the crew realizing it, despite the radio altimeter callouts; - the GPWS warnings that could have alerted the crew to an imminent contact with the sea were masked by the priority stall and overspeed warnings, in accordance with the rules on the prioritization of warnings; - the conditions for a takeoff performed towards the sea and at night provided no external visual references that would have allowed the crew to be aware of the direct proximity of the sea.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CoI Ivory Coast Report number: Report 5y-n000130 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 12 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: ICAO Adrep Summary 2/00 (#4)   Location  Images: photo (c) Commission of Inquiry; near Abidjan; 30 January 2000 photo (c) Sarah Ward; London-Heathrow Airport (LHR); 1987 photo (c) Peter Frei; ZÃ¼rich-Kloten Airport (ZRH); 08 August 1992 photo (c) Reinhard Zinabold, via Werner Fischdick; Amsterdam-Schiphol Airport (AMS); September 1999 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates02-Jan-2025 09:06 ASN Updated [Phase, Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Flight AS261 departed Puerto Vallarta at about 14:30 PST for a flight to San Francisco and Seattle. En route to San Francisco a FL310 a problem arose with the stabilizer trim. At 16:10 the crew radioed Los Angeles ARTCC that they were having control problems and that they were descending through FL260. At 16:11 Los Angeles ARTCC asked the condition of the flight and were told that they were troubleshooting a jammed stabilizer. The crew requested, and were granted, a FL200-FL250 block altitude clearance. At 16:15 the crew were handed off to Los Angeles sector control. The Alaska Airlines crew reported problems maintaining their altitude and told their intentions to divert to Los Angeles International Airport. They were cleared to do so at 16:16. The crew then requested permission to descend to FL100 over water to change their aircraft configuration . Los Angeles cleared them to FL170. Last message from Flight 261 was when they requested another block altitude. The request was granted at 16:17, without a readback from the crew. During the descent the crew was also talking to Alaska Airlines maintenance personnel in Seattle and Los Angeles to troubleshoot their stabilizer trim problems. As the crew attempted to diagnose or correct the problem the out-of-trim condition became worse, causing a tendency for the plane to pitch nose-down. When preparing the plane for landing control was lost and the MD-83 was seen 'tumbling, spinning, nose down, continuous roll, corkscrewing and inverted'. The aircraft crashed off Point Mugu in 650 feet deep water. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""A loss of airplane pitch control resulting from the in-flight failure of the horizontal stabilizer trim system jackscrew assemblyÂs acme nut threads. The thread failure was caused by excessive wear resulting from Alaska AirlinesÂ insufficient lubrication of the jackscrew assembly. Contributing to the accident were Alaska AirlinesÂ extended lubrication interval and the Federal Aviation AdministrationÂs (FAA) approval of that extension, which increased the likelihood that a missed or inadequate lubrication would result in excessive wear of the acme nut threads, and Alaska AirlinesÂ extended end play check interval and the FAAÂs approval of that extension, which allowed the excessive wear of the acme nut threads to progress to failure without the opportunity for detection. Also contributing to the accident was the absence on the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 of a fail-safe mechanism to prevent the catastrophic effects of total acme nut thread loss.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NTSB/AAR-02-01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) U.S. Department of Defense; off Point Mugu, CA photo (c) NTSB; off Point Mugu, CA; 2000; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; off Point Mugu, CA photo (c) NTSB; off Point Mugu, CA photo (c) Marlo Plate; Los Angeles International Airport, CA (LAX); August 1999 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates02-Jan-2025 09:08 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

When it went dark en route to Mwanza, the radio altimeter integral light was found to be unserviceable. The crew were not able to fix the problem and the continued using the FMS. The crew contacted Mwanza tower at 16:58 and were being advised that there was no power at the airport and that efforts were being made to use a standby generator. Further information passed on the crew reportedly included VOR, DME and NDB all unserviceable, weather: wind calm, 8 km visibility, temperature 25deg C and QNH 1015. After holding for 10 minutes, the airport generator came on and the runway lights went on. The first officer, who was pilot flying, started a visual runway 12 approach. When well established on finals with full landing configuration, the captain told the f/o that he was too low, and a few seconds later he told the f/o he was too high. Both the captain and the flight engineer then told the f/o to go around. The f/o overshot and climbed to 5500 feet on the downwind leg. Turning on the left base the captain remarked that the turn was too tight: "".. I will do a 360-degree turn to the right and position you finals"". The captain thus took over control and started a right turn at 4400 feet. Just before completing the turn, the f/o said: ""do not go down anymore, the altimeter is reading 4100 feet"". Almost aligned with the runway, the f/o took over control again. At that same moment the aircraft bounced 2 or 3 times yawing to the left and came down to a halt in the middle of the lake.Sources: AIB Bulletin 1/00  Aviation Week & Space Technology 06.03.2000  Graham Tanner  ICAO Adrep Summary 2/00 (#24)  NTSB  Panafrican news Agency  Tommy Maurer   Location  Images: photo (c) unknown; Mwanza Airport (MWZ); February 2000 photo (c) unknown; Mwanza Airport (MWZ); February 2000 photo (c) unknown; Mwanza Airport (MWZ); February 2000 photo (c) unknown; Mwanza Airport (MWZ); February 2000 photo (c) unknown; Mwanza Airport (MWZ); February 2000 photo (c) unknown; Mwanza Airport (MWZ); February 2000 photo (c) unknown; Mwanza Airport (MWZ); February 2000 photo (c) unknown; Mwanza Airport (MWZ); February 2000 photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Miami International Airport, FL (MIA); February 1993 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The same flight crew flew the airplane from Atlanta to El Salvador and back to Atlanta.  Another flight crew boarded the airplane and continued on to Los Angeles.  No discrepancies were reported by either of the flight crews or maintenance personnel in El Salvador and Atlanta.  After the airplane arrived in Los Angeles, a post flight walk around inspection revealed that the outside of the fuselage buckled on the left side above the nose landing gear door.  Further examination disclosed that structural members were bent and fractured in the nose wheel well.  The crew that landed in El Salvador stated that the nose gear touched down more firmly than the main landing gear.  They completed a post flight inspection, but detected no abnormalities.  The flight data recorder was removed and sent to the Safety Board's Vehicle Recorder Laboratory for readout and evaluation.  A Safety Board specialist conducted a data comparison for the landings in El Salvador, Atlanta, and Los Angeles.  In the El Salvador landing sequence, the air/ground FDR discrete indicated ""air"" then a second later indicated ""ground.""  A second later it indicate ""air"" again and then a second later indicated ""ground"" and remained ""ground"" for the remainder of the landing roll out.

During the approach for landing, when the landing gear was selected down, the main gear indication showed that the left main gear had not fully lowered. The crew checked the electrical and hydraulic systems but no fault was found. They also reported that after a fly-past of the control tower, the air traffic controller advised that the gear appeared down and locked. The crew then cycled the gear up then down and it lowered normally with the indication showing the gear down and locked. The landing at Dili was made without further incident. The flight engineer reported that he inspected the landing gear after landing at Dili and found no faults in the landing gear system. He said that he suspected that a micro switch might have been the cause of the indication. The aircraft operator did not have any maintenance personnel stationed at Dili and the crew did not report the problem to the operator's maintenance organisation. The aircraft returned to Darwin the next day. At about 1000 (CST), while the aircraft was on approach to Darwin airport, the crew lowered the landing gear. The nose and right main gear indicators showed that the respective gear was down and locked but the left main gear position indicator showed unsafe. Still suspecting an indication problem, the crew raised and lowered the landing gear several times, but the left main gear indicator continued to show an unsafe condition. The crew conducted a fly-past of the control tower and the controller confirmed that the left main gear was not down. Having confirmed that the nose and right main landing gear operated correctly and that the left main landing gear would not move, the pilot in command allocated flying duties to the copilot. The pilot in command and flight engineer conducted the checklist actions and attempted to lower the gear using the emergency procedures. The attempt to lower the gear hydraulically by using the landing gear override selector valve was unsuccessful. An attempt to lower the gear using the manual drive failed because the emergency engaging handle could not be moved. The flight engineer unsuccessfuly attempted to manually move the shift lever on the forward gearbox of the left landing gear from ""power"" to ""manual"" and the loadmaster then attempted to lower the gear by disconnecting the universal joints on the vertical torque shafts of the left landing gear. However, the castellated nuts on the bolts of both wheel vertical torque shaft universal joints could not be undone without using a spanner. Even using a spanner, only two of the four nuts had been undone after about 30 minutes. At about 1020, the crew of a C5 Galaxy military cargo aircraft also inbound to Darwin advised air traffic control that their aircraft was experiencing a hydraulic problem. Twenty minutes later, the crew of the Hercules informed air traffic control that the aircraft would be making a gear-up landing. The pilot in command requested that the airport's Rescue and Fire Fighting Service (RFFS) lay a foam path along the last two thirds of Runway 36. The air traffic controller informed the crew that a landing on Runway 29 was preferred and that the L-382 was number two in the ""emergency landing sequence"". Air traffic control intended that the Galaxy land first followed by the Hercules. The air traffic controller later informed the Hercules crew that the airport RFFS advised that laying foam was not standard procedure. The controller also advised that if foam was laid, no foam would be available to attend the aircraft after it landed. The pilot in command was concerned about the potential for fire caused by sparks during the landing and he requested a clearance from air traffic control to perform the landing on the grass alongside the runway. By the time two of the nuts on each of the universal joints had been undone, the fuel state of the Hercules was approaching 1,500 lbs or about 20 minutes endurance. The pilot in command decided that due to the low fuel state, there was insufficient time to undo the remaining nuts before a landing was required and he advised the controller of the aircraft's low fuel state. Concerned at the chances of the aircraft slewing off the runway after touchdown, the pilot in command also decided that the nose and right main landing gear would be raised for the landing. The Hercules was cleared to track for final approach Runway 29. The Galaxy diverted to the Royal Australian Air Force Base at Tindal. The pilot in command subsequently decided that it would be more prudent to land on the runway because of possible obstructions on the grass area. After briefing the passengers, the crew conducted their own emergency briefing, including actions after touchdown, shutdown actions, and evacuation routes. The pilot in command assumed control of the aircraft during final approach and conducted the gear up landing. At 1104, the Hercules landed on Runway 29. Touchdown was made at approximately 90 kts and the aircraft slid about 300 metres before stopping adjacent to Taxiway D. The aircraft remained straight on the runway and none of the crew or passengers were injured. They evacuated the aircraft soon after it came to rest. Although a flash fire erupted at the rear lower fuselage area while the aircraft slid along the runway, the fire did not spread. The RFFS applied foam to the area around the aircraft after it came to a halt.Sources: https://www.atsb.gov.au/publications/investigation_reports/2000/aair/aair200000618  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates19-Sep-2024 05:54 ASN Added 19-Sep-2024 07:00 ASN Updated [Time, Location, Nature, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The aircraft lost its number 1 and 2 engine cowlings on takeoff from Seattle. Following the separation of the cowlings, the flight returned to Seattle-Tacoma International and landed without further incident. There were no injuries. Post-accident inspection of the aircraft revealed substantial damage to the aircraft's left wing and left horizontal stabilizer.  The aircraft maintenance log indicated that on the previous flight (from Anchorage to Seattle, arriving at 07:18), the flight crew had written up discrepancies that the number 2 engine would not go into reverse thrust, and that the captain's course deviation indicator (CDI) was frozen. The frozen captain's CDI was determined to be a non-deferrable, Aircraft-on-Ground (AOG) item. There was also a deferred maintenance item (DMI) on the number 1 thrust reverser. Due to concerns expressed by the captain of the incoming flight about the operability of the thrust reversers in consideration of icy runway conditions at Anchorage, maintenance also decided to lube, inspect, and check all four thrust reversers for proper operation. One mechanic working on the number 2 thrust reverser asked the mechanic working on the number 1 thrust reverser to finish up the aircraft and close all engine cowls, since he had already worked over three hours overtime.  The mechanic who worked on the number 1 thrust reverser, and who was asked by the first mechanic to close all engine cowls, reported that he lowered the number 1 and 2 cowling doors, but that he and another mechanic were unable to secure and lock the doors. He stated that about 16:00, they returned to the shop for assistance in locking and securing the cowling doors. He stated that at that time, he entered in the turnover log that all four cowling doors required securing, and also verbally reported this to two other mechanics from the next shift.  One of the company mechanics who took the turnover report on the cowl doors from the first-shift mechanic stated that at about 1530, he received a tie-in from that mechanic (the one assigned to the number 1 thrust reverser) that all cowlings on N811CK needed to be closed. He noted that the cowlings for the number 1 and number 2 engines were closed and that those for the number 3 and 4 engines were wide open. He assisted in closing the number 3 engine cowl, but did not check the number 1 or number 2 cowlings to ensure that they were secured.  The captain reported that his first indication of any problems was at rotation, when the number 2 engine N2 (high pressure section) RPM indication went to zero and the number 2 engine generator light came on. He stated he also noticed the aircraft roll left slightly at that time. The captain reported that he and his crew were diagnosing the problem when the control tower called and notified him that his aircraft had left debris on the runway during takeoff. The captain stated that he then called company headquarters in Ypsilanti, Michigan, and decided to return to Seattle-Tacoma International.  The flight engineer reported that the cowlings were closed when he arrived at the aircraft, that he observed no abnormalities during the exterior preflight inspection. The number 1 and 2 engine cowls completely departed the aircraft during the accident sequence. Several cowl sections were found on the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport runway; two cowling sections were also found in a residential area in the Browns Point area of Tacoma, Washington, approximately 10 nautical miles south-southwest of the airport. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""Inadequate inspection of the number 1 and 2 engine cowls by company maintenance personnel and inadequate preflight inspection by the flight engineer, resulting in unsecured cowls separating from the aircraft during takeoff.

On this flight, there would also be the final evaluation of the first officer, with a view to  promotion to captain. The flight took place normally, without any abnormalities until the moment of landing. The weather conditions of the destination were poor with rain, strong wind with gusts and windshear indications in the vicinity of the airport. The aircraft performed the NDB ECHO 2 approach for runway 29. During the landing, the aircraft floated over the runway, touching down approximately 1000 meters past the threshold. After the touchdown, the aircraft ran for about 1400 metres before it suffered a runway excursion and collided with a ditch. The aircraft suffered severe damage. Contributing factors a. Human Factor (1) Physiological Aspect - Did Not Contribute (2) Psychological Aspect - Contributed From the knowledge of the prevailing weather conditions, it was possible for pilots to predict the possibility of ""windshear"" in the aerodrome area. In the meantime, they proceeded to land in compliance with the company's operational standards. b. Material Factor - No contribution c. Operational Factor (1) Adverse Weather Conditions - Contributed Adverse meteorological phenomena, with regard to the tailwind component, cross wind  and heavy rain, substantially interfered with the operation of the aircraft in the landing phase, leading to abnormal circumstances and loss of ground control. (2) Poor Infrastructure - Contributed The meteorological information reported to the aircraft was being obtained from measuring points located in the control tower, and not in the vicinity of the runway.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CENIPA Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Zero Hora   Location  Images: photo (c) FÃ¡bio LuÃ­s Fonseca; Porto Alegre - Salgado Filho; 28 February 2000 photo (c) FÃ¡bio LuÃ­s Fonseca; Porto Alegre - Salgado Filho; 28 February 2000 photo (c) FÃ¡bio LuÃ­s Fonseca; Porto Alegre - Salgado Filho; 28 February 2000 photo (c) Ricardo Chaves/Zero Hora; Porto Alegre - Salgado Filho; 27 February 2000 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

At the same time, the flight engineer was reconfiguring the airplane's electrical system from a Category III landing to a Category I landing.  When the flight engineer closed the ""number one bus-tie-breaker,"" the airplane experienced an uncommanded pitch-up, accompanied by numerous momentary instrument failures.  Twelve occupants were injured.  The airplane was utilizing the ""A"" autopilot system, which remained engaged.  The pilot disconnected the autopilot, leveled the airplane, re-engaged the autopilot, and continued to an uneventful landing.  During a ferry flight, maintenance personnel were able to duplicate a ""sudden pitch-up"" while using the airplane's ""B"" autopilot system, and closing the ""number two bus-tie-breaker."" Additionally, the flight crew reported that the airplane ""felt light in pitch.""  Examination of data obtained from the flight data recorder and optical quick access recorder revealed an electrical discontinuity around the time of the pitch-up. An inspection of the airplane revealed that the number 1 and 2, elevator feel computer pitot connections were capped.  Review of the airplane's maintenance history revealed that the airplane had recently undergone an ""inter 2 check"" at a British Airways maintenance facility.  During that time, maintenance personnel disconnected the pitot connections to the elevator feel computer in order to perform pitot static system checks.  The effect of the disconnected pitot-static lines on the elevator feel computer would have resulted in a more extreme travel of the elevator control surface.  The calculated expected autopilot elevator authority for the accident flight was about 4 degrees.  The estimated actual elevator deflection during the accident sequence was 6.87 degrees nose up, and 6.97 degrees nose down.  Review of the Boeing basic airplane maintenance manual section that detailed the pitot-static system checks revealed a test to confirm that the elevator feel computer was reconnected and functioned.  The test was not present the maintenance manual utilized by British Airways, which was provided by Boeing.  The source of the pitch-up command to the autopilot was not determined; however, when the autopilot system was properly configured, the pitch-up characteristics were not objectionable and within expected values. Probable Cause: Maintenance personnel's failure to reconnect the pitot connections to the elevator feel computer which resulted in an elevator control surface deflection which was outside of the normal autopilot elevator authority.  The uncommanded autopilot input to the elevator control surface resulted from an undetermined electrical source.  A factor in this accident was that the section of the 747 Maintenance Manuel utilized by company maintenance personnel did not contain an ""elevator feel light test.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NYC00LA085 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB NYC00LA085 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates03-May-2024 10:26 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

When still turning onto the main runway the crew already reported ready for takeoff. Flaps were erroneously selected at 11 degrees instead of 20 degrees. At a speed of 165 km/h during takeoff the began to rotate the aircraft. It attained a 13-degree angle of attack and climbed to a height of 8-10 metres when it stalled. The airplane rolled left and struck the ground with a 60-65 degree bank angle and crashed.Sources: MAK Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC)   Location  Images: photo (c) Lukas Lusser; Moskva-Sheremetyevo Airport (SVO); 20 August 1997 photo (c) Miklos Szabo; Budapest-Ferihegy Airport (BUD); 10 June 1999 photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Praha-Ruzyne International Airport (PRG/LKPR); October 1999 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The ILS approach to runway 18 (6,299 x 150 feet, contaminated with ice, and -.611% gradient) at Jackson Hole Airport was performed with a 6.5 knot tailwind.  During the landing roll, the captain used the emergency braking system, which deactivated the anti-skid protection.  At mid-field, the airplane slid left, then slid right, and then left back to the runway centerline where the captain said he continued braking.  The airplane continued beyond the end of the runway for 160 feet into snow approximately 2 feet deep.  The manufacturer's Airplane Flight Manual indicates that when emergency braking is utilized, the anti-skid protection is deactivated.  The CVR recorded a 'high pitch' sound at 0839:44, which was the high-pressure air of the emergency braking system being activated.  The Airplane Flight Manual also limits landing on contaminated runways to the following: A. Winds must be zero or a headwind of less than 30 knots (i.e. no tailwind); B. The runway gradient must be between -1% and  2.2%; and C. The anti-skid system must be operational. Probable Cause: The pilot not following the airplane manufacturer's recommended landing procedures for a contaminated runway by landing with a tailwind.  Factors were the pilot's inadvertent deactivation of the anti-skid protection, the ice contaminated runway, and the snow covered terrain beyond the runway.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DEN00LA057 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DEN00LA057 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates16-Oct-2022 04:17 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

The first segment of the flight from Lagos (LOS) to Abuja (ABV) was flown by the Commander. The aircraft departed Lagos about 06:30 hours UTC and initially at cruise, the crew had a momentary problem setting power on the starboard engine after which the flight continued normally to Abuja.  The aircraft which departed Abuja for Jos (JOS) at 09:00 hours UTC first officer at the controls. At FL 90 and about 30NM from Abuja, the crew again had problems with the cruise power setting on the starboard engine. The torque remained at 1400. The crew retarded the right power lever to the minimum with the aim of achieving a cruise setting of 1300 but the gear warning came on. The Commander at this stage took over the controls from the first officer. At 09:23 hours UTC, the aircraft contacted Kaduna Tower that it would be diverting to Kaduna (KAD) giving its flight level as 90 at a distance of 61 miles and estimating TMA at 24 miles, 'KC' at 41 miles, 6 souls on board and 5 hours endurance at departure. The tower then gave the aircraft an inbound clearance to 'KC' locator maintaining FL 90 and to expect no delay for a locator approach runway 05. Weather report at 09:00 hours UTC was also passed to the aircraft as wind 090/05 knots, QNH 1014 and temperature 30Â°C. At 09:28 hours UTC the airplane at about 42 miles, speed between 150-160 kts, requested descent and was cleared to 4,500ft, QNH 1014. At about 09:35 hours UTC, the pilots contacted tower that they would make a single engine approach because they were having problems controlling power on the starboard engine and it would be shut down.  The commander then reviewed the single engine approach with the first officer estimating 4,500 ft at 8NM. Approaching 4,500 ft at 11 NM, the crew initiated right engine shut down after which the speed was decayed from 150 to 140 kts. At 09:46 hours UTC, the pilot reported 6nm final and field in sight while the tower requested him to report 4 miles final. The controller reported having the aircraft in sight and subsequently cleared it to land on runway 05 giving wind as north easterly 06 knots. Descending at 500ft/min, the commander requested for 25% of flap when the first officer selected full flap. When the aircraft was at 2,700 ft high, the speed had already decayed to between 100 - 110 kts. The crew applied full power on the port engine to arrest the speed decay but to no avail. The pilot was trying to correct the descent rate, speed decay and the asymmetry when the stall warning came on.  The aircraft belly landed and struck the new VOR/DME site being constructed about 1175 m from the threshold of runway 05. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The probable cause of this accident was the poor handling by the crew of the one-engine inoperative approach.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIPB Report number: 04/375 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources: ICAO Adrep File : 00000870   Location  Images: photo (c) AIPB Nigeria; Kaduna Airport (KAD); March 2000 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The ice strip on the lake was 2700 feet approximate in length, 150 feet wide. The aircraft was observed to touch down nearly halfway along the ice strip, the tail of the aircraft remained in the air, and the aircraft took off almost immediately. The main landing gear was seen to retract. The aircraft reached the end of the runway then abruptly entered a steep, nose-up attitude, banked sharply to the left, turned left, and descended into the ice. The left wing made first contact with the ice. The aircraft rotated around the left wing and struck the ice in a steep, nose-down attitude about 400 feet from the end of the ice strip. FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: - The pilot lost control of the aircraft while conducting a go-around from a balked landing on an ice strip. - The aircraft's centre of gravity (C of G) on the accident flight was beyond the aft C of G limit. - The actual C of G of the aircraft at basic operating weight was 16.7 inches aft of the C of G provided in the weight and balance report. - The load sheet index number used by the crew was inaccurate. - The stack of 2x4 lumber was inadequately secured and may have shifted rearward during the go-around. - The crew did not recalculate the aircraft's weight and balance for the second flight. - Leaks in the heater shroud allowed carbon monoxide gas to contaminate cockpit and cabin air. - The captain's carboxyhaemoglobin level was 17.9 per cent, which may have adversely affected his performance, especially his decision making and his visual acuity.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: TSB Report A00C0059 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Both crewmembers said they never saw the tug until after the collision, and when the aircraft door was opened, they realized that the baggage vehicle had collided with their aircraft. The police report showed that the pilot had said in his initial report, that he felt as if the left wing had been pushed hard and he had observed that the aircraft's left propeller and wing, as well as the rear baggage carts were damaged. The police report also showed that the baggage cart had been equipped with no lights, only reflectors, and that the distance from the center of the yellow taxi line to the impact point where the debris lay was about 30 feet. In addition, a ramp control incident report showed that in addition to the debris being located 30 feet from the yellow line, the debris was also located 73 feet from the aircraft containment line. The tug driver stated that he had been driving as close to the fuchsia (red) line as was possible, when the collision occurred. The ramp supervisor who was marshalling the aircraft and witnessed the collision stated that he was 100 feet away, and observed that the tug and cart was coming from the left side of the aircraft, trying to cross the taxiway from one side to the other, and the tug driver did not notice the aircraft taxiing in, and tried to avoid hitting the aircraft by making a turn to the left, but he hit the airplane with the cart, causing damage to the airplane's left wing and propeller.

Prior to starting the approach, the flightcrew determined that the landing approach speed (Vref) and the approach speed (Vapp) were 122 and 128 knots, respectively. The airplane flying on autopilot passed the middle marker at 200 feet AGL at 130 knots on the ILS approach. Approximately 3 seconds after the first officer called ""runway in sight twelve o'clock,"" the captain disconnected the autopilot, while at a radio altitude of 132 feet and on a heading of approximately 18 degrees. Within approximately 11 seconds after the autopilot disconnect, the glideslope and localizer deviation increased. The first officer called ""runway over there.""

The departure and en route portions of the flight to Fox Harbour were unremarkable until preparation for the descent. The owner of the IAI Astra jet had made it clear to this crew, and to other crews on previous occasions, that he expected arrivals and approaches to be flown in minimum time. The operating crew and other employees confirmed this pressure, and aircrew therefore planned and conducted their operations accordingly. In preparation for the arrival and the approach to Fox Harbour, the crew inserted a series of waypoints in the flight management system to guide them for a straight-in approach and landing on runway 33. In general, the descent was flown at high speed on a track following the navigation waypoints programmed in the flight management system by the crew. Speed brakes were required to slow the aircraft during the descent. Example speeds show that the aircraft was at 340 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS) at 10 000 feet, 310 KIAS at 5000 feet, and 250 KIAS at 1000 feet. At 1000 feet, the aircraft was levelled and decelerated to configure for approach and landing. About this time, there was a slight quartering tailwind component, estimated to be about six knots. Because the speed was high throughout the descent, flaps and landing gear selections were delayed and, consequently, not fully extended until about three miles from the runway. At this time, the co-pilot went ""heads down"" to ensure that all checklist items were complete and to confirm that the aircraft was properly configured to land. When he next looked up, he observed that the aircraft was low in relationship to the runway and advised the captain, who corrected by levelling the aircraft. The aircraft altitude was recorded on radar to be between 200 and 300 feet above sea level while tracking inbound to the airport. A short distance before the tree line the aircraft began descending again. The co-pilot saw trees between the aircraft and the runway and called for an overshoot. The captain had begun the overshoot on the co-pilot's call; however, the action was not taken in time to avoid striking the trees. About 50 feet above ground level and 1300 feet from the threshold of runway 33, the aircraft struck the trees and descended 10 feet into the treetops, then climbed away. Damage to the aircraft comprised wing leading-edge dents, minor fuselage perforations, leading- and trailing-edge flap dents and perforations, nose and landing-gear door damage, and foreign object damage to both engines. Tree debris was entangled in the landing gear; some of this debris fell from the aircraft during the overshoot. Debris that entered the engines subsequently resulted in an odour of burning wood and some smoke in the cabin. Once the aircraft began climbing on the overshoot, the crew raised the landing gear and the trailing-edge flaps. Both systems functioned normally. The initial decision to raise the landing gear and the flaps was re-examined during the overshoot climb, resulting in the leading-edge flaps being left extended. The crew contacted air traffic control on the overshoot, declared an emergency, and requested clearance to Charlottetown. Charlottetown was chosen because it was nearby and clearly visible from Fox Harbour, had landing aids, and had airport emergency response services. The aircraft continued to Charlottetown for a straight-in approach and an uneventful landing and shutdown. FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1. Conditions conducive to black-hole illusion were present during the night approach to the runway. 2. In this situation, the crew did not recognize the potential hazard of the black-hole illusion and therefore did not compensate for it. 3. The crew did not adhere to the required standard operating procedures for the preparation and execution of the approach. Consequently, the crew were inadequately prepared for the visual conditions on final approach. FINDINGS AS TO RISK: 1. The high descent and intermediate approach speeds caused cockpit pre-landing checks to be delayed. This delay resulted in the co-pilot's attention being diverted inside the cockpit when approach monitoring should have been done. 2. The crew's decision to raise the landing gear and the flaps on the overshoot after hitting the trees increased the risk to the flight.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A00A0051 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: TSB Report Number A00A0051 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  5 February 2010 C-FRJZ Jetport Inc. 0 In flight near Hamilton, Ontario min Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

It landed in Bangkok-Don Muang International Airport (BKK), Thailand after an uneventful flight. The same flight crew made the return flight back to Colombo after 4 hours and 20 minutes ground time in Bangkok. The crew had received the weather report prior to departure. The aircraft was refueled adding 6681 kg of fuel to the remaining 8300 kg bringing the total fuel onboard to 14981 kg. Flight SCB 702 departed Bangkok. The scheduled flight time for Bangkok - Colombo was five hours and twenty minutes with a scheduled time of arrival of 17:00 hours. SCB 702 made the first radio contact with Sri Lanka air traffic control at 16:16. The area controller passed SCB702 the latest weather report effective for Colombo. At 16:40 the controller radioed: ""There is a sigmet valid up to 1415 UTC, Colombo FIR CBs, Thunderstorms were found having tops up to FL360 over Sri Lanka including Colombo and Ratmalana airfields and now contact Colombo Director on 132.4 Mhz."" When the crew contacted the approach radar controller (Director) they were asked to report the radial and DME from Colombo, (i.e. from ""DVOR/DME KAT""). SCB 702 reported as saying ""074 radial and 55 DME ready for descent"". Later, flight SCB 702 made two unsuccessful ILS approaches to runway 04. While on a radar heading to get established on the ILS to runway 22 for a third attempt to land, all four engines stopped. The propellers were feathered and the aircraft entered a controlled glide. It cut through several coconut trees before crashing on the houses. The left wing had separated first. The right wing then separated as well. Both wings lost all engines in the process.  There had been two isolated minor fires where the main wing tank and the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) were found. Both the fires had not spread to other areas and had extinguished on its own. CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT: The aircraft accident occurred due to fuel starvation. Contributory factors to the accident are as follows. i) Violation of Air Navigation Regulations on fuel planning; ii) Failure of the flight crew to declare an emergency; iii) Being unable to land due to adverse weather situation; iv) Lack of communicability of the flight crew in English language; v) Non-availability of established air traffic control procedures to assist an aircraft in distress; vi) Failure of Skycabs (Pvt.)

No injuries reported to the passengers and crew (exact numbers of passengers and crew not reported).  ""Towards the end of the taxi out to the hold for Runway 9R, which was reported to have been conducted at speeds no higher than 9 knots, the crew heard a loud bang and felt a slight âbumpâ. Almost immediately all of the anti-skid warning lights associated with the right wing landing gear illuminated on the flight deck. About this time a passenger informed the cabin crew that he had seen a tyre roll from under the aircraft across the grass, between the taxiway and the runway.  The aircraft stopped at the holding point and was duly inspected by airport personnel. It was evident that the inboard rim of the No 2 wheel (front inboard wheel of the left wing landing gear) had completely detached from the wheel and this had allowed the tyre to come off. After wheels Nos 1 and 2 had been changed, the aircraft was towed back to the gate where the passengers disembarked normally"" Further examination of the aircraft revealed that fragments of the failed inboard rim had been jettisoned by the released inboard wall of the tyre and caused impact damage to the right main gear door, the right wing landing gear and its folding door. In addition, a wiring conduit which was mounted on the right wing gear drag brace, and contained the anti-skid units wiring, had been severed in two places.

The captain advised the first flight attendant to expect turbulence.  He turned on the fasten seat belt sign, and he directed that cabin service be suspended and the service carts stowed.  The first flight attendant notified the other flight attendants of the captain's instructions.  She stated that she directed them to ""stop service and take their seats immediately.""  The flight attendants secured the cabin, which took a few minutes. However, they had not taken their seats when the airplane encountered several jolts of moderate turbulence.  The airplane's flight data recorder indicated that within a 1/2-second period the vertical acceleration changed from -0.05G to  2.37Gs.  The first flight attendant (front cabin) was knocked off her feet.  The three flight attendants in the aft galley were thrown upward but did not strike the ceiling before coming back down and falling to the floor.  One was seriously injured.  The operator's ""InFlight Operations Manual"" required the flight crew to use standard terminology during briefings to the flight attendants.  The descriptive terms include usage of the words ""light, moderate, or severe"" when describing expected turbulence.  Neither the captain nor any of the flight attendants reported having used/heard these terms regarding the anticipated turbulence intensity.

CAUSE: During a non-scheduled commercial flight, during landing, the aircraft deviated to the left of the runway and one of the blades of the No. 1 propeller impacted a beacon, due to an inadequate sequence in the activation of the engine controls and propeller pitch.Sources: http://www.jiaac.gob.ar/files/pdf/Bol30.pdf  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates23-May-2023 21:28 harro Updated Corrections or additions? ...

Flight 541 departed Manila (MNL) at 05:21 hours and was due to land at Davao (DVO), Philippines, around 06:45.  The aircraft was being flown as a route check for a captain. Another captain was acting as Pilot Monitoring on the flight. The en route part of the flight was uneventful. The aircraft was conducting an ILS approach to runway 05 and the controller reported that they would be behind Philippine Airlines flight 809, an Airbus A319. As the Boeing 737 broke out of clouds, the A319 was observed on runway 05. The Pilot Flying informed ATC of his intention to perform a 360Â° maneuver, but the Pilot Monitoring advised ATC of the opposite, stating that the aircraft would turn right instead of following the missed approach procedure, which called for a left hand turn to a 020Â° heading. The aircraft re-entered clouds and attempted to fly visually at a lower altitude in instrument conditions when in fact it should have climbed to 4000 feet.  The flight continued over Samal Island and the flight requested a VOR/DME approach and landing in the opposite direction (runway 23), which was approved by the controller. After having aligned with the runway heading, the aircraft descended below the normal glide path for this approach. It continued down to 570 feet at a point where the aircraft should have been at 1500 feet. The aircraft crashed into a coconut plantation on a hillside in Barangay San Isidro, disintegrated and caught fire.Sources: AP  ICAO Adrep  Nolan News, Fall 08  Philippine Daily Inquirer  The Philippine STAR   Location  Images: photo (c) Erik Oxtorp, via Werner Fischdick; Manila-Ninoy Aquino International Airport (MNL); June 1999 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates05-Jan-2025 19:52 ASN Updated [Narrative, ]10-Feb-2025 07:40 ASN Updated The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The 3-man cockpit crew, 11-person cabin crew, and 220 passengers were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. An instrument flight rules flight plan had been filed for the flight, between Newark and Brussels Airport (BRU), Belgium.  Startup and taxi were normal, and during the taxi, the captain again briefed the cockpit crew, and included engine failures, as well as ""non-reject"" situations. The airplane lined up on runway 04L, and the captain applied takeoff power slowly and smoothly. At takeoff decision speed (V1), there was a loud explosion. A white ""engine fail"" light illuminated in front of the captain, and the number 1 engine N1 decreased by 30 percent. Number 2 and number 3 engines appeared normal.  The captain continued the takeoff, and the landing gear was raised. A red, left main landing gear warning light illuminated on the front panel. The airplane turned to a heading of 010, and slowly climbed to 3,000 feet. During the climb, an airframe vibration developed.  After level-off, the crew began to troubleshoot the emergency, and found that when the number 3 engine N1 was reduced, the vibration disappeared. Both the number 1 and the number 3 engines remained at reduced power, in relation to number 2, for the rest of the flight.  Air traffic control personnel provided vectors for a return to Newark. During the return, the crew dumped about 90,000 pounds of fuel. The crew also ran both 1-engine, and 2-engine inoperative checklists, and prepared data cards for both scenarios.  The captain flew the ILS glideslope down to a full-stop landing, on runway 04R at 20:16. After stopping on the runway, the brakes would not release, so the crew shut down the engines, and the passengers and crew disembarked through the normal deplaning doors. The airplane was later towed to a ramp.

The aircraft was then prepared for Crossair flight 498 to Dresden. Germany. Taxi clearance was given at 17:50 and the crew taxied to runway 28. The crew expected to be cleared for a standard instrument departure SID ZUE 1Y. This procedure calls for the aircraft to climb straight ahead heading 280 and then make a left turn to cross overhead the airport at the KLO VOR and then assume a heading of 054Â° onto airway R234 to the Zurich East (ZUE) beacon. At 17:54 the aircraft was cleared for takeoff. Takeoff and climb were conducted with flaps at 0 degrees, which is normal for a Saab 340 departing from runway 28. The aircraft climbed normally at 136 knots IAS. After retracting the gear the Flight Director was switched on. While climbing through 2500 feet QNH the crew switched to Zurich Departure Control and were recleared to climb to FL110. At 17:55 the crew were cleared to make a left turn to intercept airway R234. A left turn was initiated, during which the first officer entered a command in the Flight Management System (FMS) to ZUE. The command ""direct to (DTO) Â left Â ZUE"" however was programmed only as ""direct to Â ZUE"". The programming was performed by the first officer alone, without the prescribed monitoring and checking by the captain. The latter was absorbed in manually flying the aircraft.  After having turned left for 7 seconds the captain started a right turn, consistent with Flight Director commands generated by the FMS for a 'direct to ZUE' as the right hand turn was the shortest.  In clouds the aircraft continued a right roll, which at 17:56:14 reached a right bank angle of 65.8Â°. The first officer advised the captain that the aircraft should actually turn to the left. This was also noted by the Zurich departure controller at 17:56:20, who asked the crew about the direction of the turn. The first officer replied: ""Moment please, stand by"". Upon which the Departure controller recleared the flight to continue the right turn direct to ZUE. By then the pitch had also decreased rapidly, accompanied by a marked speed increase and the Saab entered a high speed high-rate spiral descent. At 17:56:28 the aircraft crashed in an open field. Weather reported included temperature 2deg C; dew point 1deg C; 1032 mB wind WNW/3 knots and light drizzle. CAUSES: ""The accident is attributable to a collision with the ground, after the flight crew had lost control of the aircraft for the following reasons: - The flight crew reacted inappropriately to the change in departure clearance SID ZUE 1Y by ATC. - The co-pilot made an entry in the FMS, without being instructed to do so by the commander, which related to the change to the SID ZUE 1 standard instrument departure. In doing so, he omitted to select a turn direction. - The commander dispensed with use of the autopilot under instrument flight conditions and during the work-intensive climb phase of the flight. - The commander took the aircraft into a spiral dive to the right because, with a probability bordering on certainty, he had lost spatial orientation. - The first officer took only inadequate measures to prevent or recover from the spiral dive. The following factors may have contributed to the accident: - The commander remained unilaterally firm in perceptions which suggested a left turn direction to him. - When interpreting the attitude display instruments under stress, the commander resorted to a reaction pattern (heuristics) which he had learned earlier. - The commanderÂs capacity for analysis and critical assessment of the situation were possibly limited as a result of the effects of medication. - After the change to standard instrument departure SID ZUE 1Y the crew set inappropriate priorities for their tasks and their concentration remained one-sided. - The commander was not systematically acquainted by Crossair with the specific features of western systems and cockpit procedures.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BFU Switz.

The descent from FL70 was started at 14:25. Eleven minutes later both engines flamed out. The aircraft was ditched off the Libyan coast in a 10deg nose up attitude. The tail broke off and the wreckage sank inverted to a depth of 38 m, about 3 miles from the coast.  According to the Libyan investigation report, the first officer and co-pilot, who both survived, were so busy talking about how to fly the Fokker F-28 aircraft that they failed to switch on the anti-icing system for the engines as weather conditions deteriorated. As the aircraft came in to land, ice that had been allowed to build up melted, flooding the engines and cutting off the power. A device that might have restarted the engines was not switched on. There were no lifejackets on board and many of the dead drowned because they were unaware that their seat cushions doubled as floats.

The aircraft had a full load of passengers which meant that there would be little time for the cabin crew to carry out full service program on the shorter than normal flight.  After departure the seat belt sign remained on for approximately five minutes due to turbulence in the climb-out. Ten minutes before landing, when the commander turned on the ""fasten seat belt sign"", two cabin attendants were standing in the aft galley stowing their service carts. One cabin attendant was leaning slightly forward to lock a cart in place when the aircraft was through about in the turbulence. She flew up in the air and landed on the floor on her back with the right leg under her. She received help during the remainder of the flight and was then brought to hospital.  After examination in the hospital it was determined that she had suffered three fractures in her right ankle. Conclusion Turbulence was experienced during the flight. The sudden severe shaking that was felt caused the C/A to lose her balance and fall, breaking her ankle. Contributing to the accident onboard was the fact that the short flight time provided little opportunity for the cabin attendants to complete the normal service program for a fully seated flight and then be seated with their seat belts fastened in good time prior to the landing. SHK considers that the need for serving a complete service program on short flights in turbulent weather can be questioned from a safety point of view.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: SHK Report number: RL 2000:17e Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: ICAO  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates19-Sep-2024 05:54 ASN Added 19-Sep-2024 06:20 ASN Updated [Operator, Location, Departure airport, Destination airport, Narrative, Category, Accident report, ] Corrections or additions? ...

During the descent and vectors for the approach to runway 31R at Love Field, the airplane began to accumulate moderate clear ice, and a master warning light illumination in the cockpit indicated that the horizontal stabilizer heat had failed. The crew continued the approach to get the airplane out of the icing conditions and on the ground as soon as possible. Considering the possibility of additional ice accumulation on the horizontal stabilizer, the crew, per the flight manual abnormal procedures checklist, configured the airplane for a touchdown speed of 120 knots in lieu of 108 knots, and a flap extension of 10 degrees in lieu of 30 degrees. The aircraft touched down approximately 1,500 feet down the runway and the captain began applying the brakes. The captain reported that the aircraft did not have any braking action for approximately 3,000 feet and the anti-skid was not pulsing. With about 1,500 feet of runway remaining, it looked to the captain like there would not be enough available runway to stop the aircraft. Beyond the departure end of the runway, there was a steep down hill embankment and support poles for the approach lights for runway 13L. The captain forced the aircraft to depart the right side of the runway to avoid the poles. After the aircraft started down the embankment, the nose gear collapsed and the airplane came to rest. The wreckage was sold to Dodson International Parts and was last seen at their Rantoul, KS scrapyard in September 2005.

The crew initiated their descent at a 'later than normal distance' from the airport, and as a result, a power reduction below 25 percent torque was required, which set off the gear warning horn.  The sound 'eventually became part of the background noise.'  During the approach, the captain asked the tower to dim the runway lights.  At that time, the runway and approach lights went out and the crew lost sight of the runway.  While the captain was asking the tower to turn the lights back on, the first officer called 'gear down, syncs off, speeds high, below the line check list.'  The captain did not hear the first officer's callout and did not lower the landing gear.  The captain stated that he did not hear the first officer's callout 'either because of the conversation [he] was having with the tower or because of the intercom system difficulties.'  As the approach continued, the first officer had a problem slowing the airplane to proper approach speed.  The airplane touched down on the runway with the landing gear retracted, 'slid' about 2,500 feet and exited the left side of the runway. Probable Cause: The flight crew's failure to extend the landing gear.  Contributing factors were the flight crew's non-compliance with the checklist, the pilot-in-command's diverted attention as a result of the loss of instrument approach/runway lighting, the partial failure of the instrument approach/runway lighting system, and the partial failure of the intercom system.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: FTW00LA078 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB FTW00LA078 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates16-Oct-2022 05:46 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

Flight KQ430 departed from Nairobi for a flight to Lagos and Abidjan. Due to the harmattan, a dusty seasonal wind from the deserts of north Africa, the flight continued directly to Abidjan. The aircraft, named ""Harambee Star"", landed there at 15:15 local time.  The Airbus was prepared for the return flight, KQ431, to Lagos and Nairobi that evening. Shortly after 21:00 the crew received clearance to taxy to runway 21 for departure. The trim was set at 0.9 nose up, slats and flaps at 15 degrees. The airplane began to taxi at 21:07, the tower controller informed the crew of the latest wind, cleared them to take off and asked the crew the call back when they reached flight level 40. At 21:08:18, the captain, who was pilot non flying, applied takeoff power and announced ""thrust, SRS, and runway"" then, nine seconds later ""100 knots"". Flight 431 took off and at 21:08:57, the copilot announced ""Positive rate of climb, gear up"". Less than two seconds later, at a height of around 300 feet, the stall warning sounded. The gear was not retracted. The copilot, who was the pilot flying, pushed forward on the control column in reaction to the stall warnings. At 21:09:07, the copilot asked, ""What's the problem?"" The aircraft descended and less than a second before passing through 100 feet in descent, the copilot ordered the aural stall warning alarm to be disconnected. The GPWS sounded briefly, followed by the CRC (Continuous Repetitive Chime), which corresponds to a master warning of over-speed with flaps extended, immediately followed by an order from the captain ""Go up!"". The airplane's speed at this point was at least 210 knots, the maximum speed limit for a configuration with slats/flaps at 15Â°/15Â°. At 21:09:24 the airplane contacted the sea and broke up. The wreckage came to rest on the sandy seabed at a depth of 40-50 metres. Just ten of the 179 occupants survived the accident. CAUSES OF THE ACCIDENT:  ""The Commission of Inquiry concluded that the cause of the accident to flight KQ 431 on 30 January 2000 was a collision with the sea that resulted from the pilot flying applying one part of the procedure, by pushing forward on the control column to stop the stick shaker, following the initiation of a stall warning on rotation, while the airplane was not in a true stall situation. In fact, the FCOM used by the airline states that whenever a stall warning is encountered at low altitude (stick shaker activation), it should be considered as an immediate threat to the maintenance of a safe flight path. It specifies that at the first sign of an imminent stall or at the time of a stick shaker activation, the following actions must be undertaken simultaneously: thrust levers in TOGA position, reduction of pitch attitude, wings level, check that speed brakes are retracted. The investigation showed that the pilot flying reduced the pitch attitude but did not apply TOGA thrust on the engines. The investigation was unable to determine if the crew performed the other two actions: leveling the wings and checking that the speed brakes were retracted. The following elements contributed to the accident: - the pilot flying's action on the control column put the airplane into a descent without the crew realizing it, despite the radio altimeter callouts; - the GPWS warnings that could have alerted the crew to an imminent contact with the sea were masked by the priority stall and overspeed warnings, in accordance with the rules on the prioritization of warnings; - the conditions for a takeoff performed towards the sea and at night provided no external visual references that would have allowed the crew to be aware of the direct proximity of the sea.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CoI Ivory Coast Report number: Report 5y-n000130 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 12 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: ICAO Adrep Summary 2/00 (#4)   Location  Images: photo (c) Commission of Inquiry; near Abidjan; 30 January 2000 photo (c) Sarah Ward; London-Heathrow Airport (LHR); 1987 photo (c) Peter Frei; ZÃ¼rich-Kloten Airport (ZRH); 08 August 1992 photo (c) Reinhard Zinabold, via Werner Fischdick; Amsterdam-Schiphol Airport (AMS); September 1999 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates02-Jan-2025 09:06 ASN Updated [Phase, Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Flight AS261 departed Puerto Vallarta at about 14:30 PST for a flight to San Francisco and Seattle. En route to San Francisco a FL310 a problem arose with the stabilizer trim. At 16:10 the crew radioed Los Angeles ARTCC that they were having control problems and that they were descending through FL260. At 16:11 Los Angeles ARTCC asked the condition of the flight and were told that they were troubleshooting a jammed stabilizer. The crew requested, and were granted, a FL200-FL250 block altitude clearance. At 16:15 the crew were handed off to Los Angeles sector control. The Alaska Airlines crew reported problems maintaining their altitude and told their intentions to divert to Los Angeles International Airport. They were cleared to do so at 16:16. The crew then requested permission to descend to FL100 over water to change their aircraft configuration . Los Angeles cleared them to FL170. Last message from Flight 261 was when they requested another block altitude. The request was granted at 16:17, without a readback from the crew. During the descent the crew was also talking to Alaska Airlines maintenance personnel in Seattle and Los Angeles to troubleshoot their stabilizer trim problems. As the crew attempted to diagnose or correct the problem the out-of-trim condition became worse, causing a tendency for the plane to pitch nose-down. When preparing the plane for landing control was lost and the MD-83 was seen 'tumbling, spinning, nose down, continuous roll, corkscrewing and inverted'. The aircraft crashed off Point Mugu in 650 feet deep water. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""A loss of airplane pitch control resulting from the in-flight failure of the horizontal stabilizer trim system jackscrew assemblyÂs acme nut threads. The thread failure was caused by excessive wear resulting from Alaska AirlinesÂ insufficient lubrication of the jackscrew assembly. Contributing to the accident were Alaska AirlinesÂ extended lubrication interval and the Federal Aviation AdministrationÂs (FAA) approval of that extension, which increased the likelihood that a missed or inadequate lubrication would result in excessive wear of the acme nut threads, and Alaska AirlinesÂ extended end play check interval and the FAAÂs approval of that extension, which allowed the excessive wear of the acme nut threads to progress to failure without the opportunity for detection. Also contributing to the accident was the absence on the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 of a fail-safe mechanism to prevent the catastrophic effects of total acme nut thread loss.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NTSB/AAR-02-01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) U.S. Department of Defense; off Point Mugu, CA photo (c) NTSB; off Point Mugu, CA; 2000; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; off Point Mugu, CA photo (c) NTSB; off Point Mugu, CA photo (c) Marlo Plate; Los Angeles International Airport, CA (LAX); August 1999 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates02-Jan-2025 09:08 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

On approaching Filitheyo Seaplane Base, the captain realized that the GPS position fed to the system was that of the resort island (Filitheyo), not the GPS position of the landing site near Filitheyo resort (Dhiguvaru Falhu) which is about 2.5 miles (4 km) north of Filitheyo. The captain, until he was about to land was busy in correcting the GPS co-ordinates for the landing site. On landing on water the aircraft sprung back and the captain realized that the landing gear was down. The aircraft bounced back and flipped onto its back pivoting the nose and left wing.

When it went dark en route to Mwanza, the radio altimeter integral light was found to be unserviceable. The crew were not able to fix the problem and the continued using the FMS. The crew contacted Mwanza tower at 16:58 and were being advised that there was no power at the airport and that efforts were being made to use a standby generator. Further information passed on the crew reportedly included VOR, DME and NDB all unserviceable, weather: wind calm, 8 km visibility, temperature 25deg C and QNH 1015. After holding for 10 minutes, the airport generator came on and the runway lights went on. The first officer, who was pilot flying, started a visual runway 12 approach. When well established on finals with full landing configuration, the captain told the f/o that he was too low, and a few seconds later he told the f/o he was too high. Both the captain and the flight engineer then told the f/o to go around. The f/o overshot and climbed to 5500 feet on the downwind leg. Turning on the left base the captain remarked that the turn was too tight: "".. I will do a 360-degree turn to the right and position you finals"". The captain thus took over control and started a right turn at 4400 feet. Just before completing the turn, the f/o said: ""do not go down anymore, the altimeter is reading 4100 feet"". Almost aligned with the runway, the f/o took over control again. At that same moment the aircraft bounced 2 or 3 times yawing to the left and came down to a halt in the middle of the lake.Sources: AIB Bulletin 1/00  Aviation Week & Space Technology 06.03.2000  Graham Tanner  ICAO Adrep Summary 2/00 (#24)  NTSB  Panafrican news Agency  Tommy Maurer   Location  Images: photo (c) unknown; Mwanza Airport (MWZ); February 2000 photo (c) unknown; Mwanza Airport (MWZ); February 2000 photo (c) unknown; Mwanza Airport (MWZ); February 2000 photo (c) unknown; Mwanza Airport (MWZ); February 2000 photo (c) unknown; Mwanza Airport (MWZ); February 2000 photo (c) unknown; Mwanza Airport (MWZ); February 2000 photo (c) unknown; Mwanza Airport (MWZ); February 2000 photo (c) unknown; Mwanza Airport (MWZ); February 2000 photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Miami International Airport, FL (MIA); February 1993 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The same flight crew flew the airplane from Atlanta to El Salvador and back to Atlanta.  Another flight crew boarded the airplane and continued on to Los Angeles.  No discrepancies were reported by either of the flight crews or maintenance personnel in El Salvador and Atlanta.  After the airplane arrived in Los Angeles, a post flight walk around inspection revealed that the outside of the fuselage buckled on the left side above the nose landing gear door.  Further examination disclosed that structural members were bent and fractured in the nose wheel well.  The crew that landed in El Salvador stated that the nose gear touched down more firmly than the main landing gear.  They completed a post flight inspection, but detected no abnormalities.  The flight data recorder was removed and sent to the Safety Board's Vehicle Recorder Laboratory for readout and evaluation.  A Safety Board specialist conducted a data comparison for the landings in El Salvador, Atlanta, and Los Angeles.  In the El Salvador landing sequence, the air/ground FDR discrete indicated ""air"" then a second later indicated ""ground.""  A second later it indicate ""air"" again and then a second later indicated ""ground"" and remained ""ground"" for the remainder of the landing roll out.

During the approach for landing, when the landing gear was selected down, the main gear indication showed that the left main gear had not fully lowered. The crew checked the electrical and hydraulic systems but no fault was found. They also reported that after a fly-past of the control tower, the air traffic controller advised that the gear appeared down and locked. The crew then cycled the gear up then down and it lowered normally with the indication showing the gear down and locked. The landing at Dili was made without further incident. The flight engineer reported that he inspected the landing gear after landing at Dili and found no faults in the landing gear system. He said that he suspected that a micro switch might have been the cause of the indication. The aircraft operator did not have any maintenance personnel stationed at Dili and the crew did not report the problem to the operator's maintenance organisation. The aircraft returned to Darwin the next day. At about 1000 (CST), while the aircraft was on approach to Darwin airport, the crew lowered the landing gear. The nose and right main gear indicators showed that the respective gear was down and locked but the left main gear position indicator showed unsafe. Still suspecting an indication problem, the crew raised and lowered the landing gear several times, but the left main gear indicator continued to show an unsafe condition. The crew conducted a fly-past of the control tower and the controller confirmed that the left main gear was not down. Having confirmed that the nose and right main landing gear operated correctly and that the left main landing gear would not move, the pilot in command allocated flying duties to the copilot. The pilot in command and flight engineer conducted the checklist actions and attempted to lower the gear using the emergency procedures. The attempt to lower the gear hydraulically by using the landing gear override selector valve was unsuccessful. An attempt to lower the gear using the manual drive failed because the emergency engaging handle could not be moved. The flight engineer unsuccessfuly attempted to manually move the shift lever on the forward gearbox of the left landing gear from ""power"" to ""manual"" and the loadmaster then attempted to lower the gear by disconnecting the universal joints on the vertical torque shafts of the left landing gear. However, the castellated nuts on the bolts of both wheel vertical torque shaft universal joints could not be undone without using a spanner. Even using a spanner, only two of the four nuts had been undone after about 30 minutes. At about 1020, the crew of a C5 Galaxy military cargo aircraft also inbound to Darwin advised air traffic control that their aircraft was experiencing a hydraulic problem. Twenty minutes later, the crew of the Hercules informed air traffic control that the aircraft would be making a gear-up landing. The pilot in command requested that the airport's Rescue and Fire Fighting Service (RFFS) lay a foam path along the last two thirds of Runway 36. The air traffic controller informed the crew that a landing on Runway 29 was preferred and that the L-382 was number two in the ""emergency landing sequence"". Air traffic control intended that the Galaxy land first followed by the Hercules. The air traffic controller later informed the Hercules crew that the airport RFFS advised that laying foam was not standard procedure. The controller also advised that if foam was laid, no foam would be available to attend the aircraft after it landed. The pilot in command was concerned about the potential for fire caused by sparks during the landing and he requested a clearance from air traffic control to perform the landing on the grass alongside the runway. By the time two of the nuts on each of the universal joints had been undone, the fuel state of the Hercules was approaching 1,500 lbs or about 20 minutes endurance. The pilot in command decided that due to the low fuel state, there was insufficient time to undo the remaining nuts before a landing was required and he advised the controller of the aircraft's low fuel state. Concerned at the chances of the aircraft slewing off the runway after touchdown, the pilot in command also decided that the nose and right main landing gear would be raised for the landing. The Hercules was cleared to track for final approach Runway 29. The Galaxy diverted to the Royal Australian Air Force Base at Tindal. The pilot in command subsequently decided that it would be more prudent to land on the runway because of possible obstructions on the grass area. After briefing the passengers, the crew conducted their own emergency briefing, including actions after touchdown, shutdown actions, and evacuation routes. The pilot in command assumed control of the aircraft during final approach and conducted the gear up landing. At 1104, the Hercules landed on Runway 29. Touchdown was made at approximately 90 kts and the aircraft slid about 300 metres before stopping adjacent to Taxiway D. The aircraft remained straight on the runway and none of the crew or passengers were injured. They evacuated the aircraft soon after it came to rest. Although a flash fire erupted at the rear lower fuselage area while the aircraft slid along the runway, the fire did not spread. The RFFS applied foam to the area around the aircraft after it came to a halt.Sources: https://www.atsb.gov.au/publications/investigation_reports/2000/aair/aair200000618  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates19-Sep-2024 05:54 ASN Added 19-Sep-2024 07:00 ASN Updated [Time, Location, Nature, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The aircraft lost its number 1 and 2 engine cowlings on takeoff from Seattle. Following the separation of the cowlings, the flight returned to Seattle-Tacoma International and landed without further incident. There were no injuries. Post-accident inspection of the aircraft revealed substantial damage to the aircraft's left wing and left horizontal stabilizer.  The aircraft maintenance log indicated that on the previous flight (from Anchorage to Seattle, arriving at 07:18), the flight crew had written up discrepancies that the number 2 engine would not go into reverse thrust, and that the captain's course deviation indicator (CDI) was frozen. The frozen captain's CDI was determined to be a non-deferrable, Aircraft-on-Ground (AOG) item. There was also a deferred maintenance item (DMI) on the number 1 thrust reverser. Due to concerns expressed by the captain of the incoming flight about the operability of the thrust reversers in consideration of icy runway conditions at Anchorage, maintenance also decided to lube, inspect, and check all four thrust reversers for proper operation. One mechanic working on the number 2 thrust reverser asked the mechanic working on the number 1 thrust reverser to finish up the aircraft and close all engine cowls, since he had already worked over three hours overtime.  The mechanic who worked on the number 1 thrust reverser, and who was asked by the first mechanic to close all engine cowls, reported that he lowered the number 1 and 2 cowling doors, but that he and another mechanic were unable to secure and lock the doors. He stated that about 16:00, they returned to the shop for assistance in locking and securing the cowling doors. He stated that at that time, he entered in the turnover log that all four cowling doors required securing, and also verbally reported this to two other mechanics from the next shift.  One of the company mechanics who took the turnover report on the cowl doors from the first-shift mechanic stated that at about 1530, he received a tie-in from that mechanic (the one assigned to the number 1 thrust reverser) that all cowlings on N811CK needed to be closed. He noted that the cowlings for the number 1 and number 2 engines were closed and that those for the number 3 and 4 engines were wide open. He assisted in closing the number 3 engine cowl, but did not check the number 1 or number 2 cowlings to ensure that they were secured.  The captain reported that his first indication of any problems was at rotation, when the number 2 engine N2 (high pressure section) RPM indication went to zero and the number 2 engine generator light came on. He stated he also noticed the aircraft roll left slightly at that time. The captain reported that he and his crew were diagnosing the problem when the control tower called and notified him that his aircraft had left debris on the runway during takeoff. The captain stated that he then called company headquarters in Ypsilanti, Michigan, and decided to return to Seattle-Tacoma International.  The flight engineer reported that the cowlings were closed when he arrived at the aircraft, that he observed no abnormalities during the exterior preflight inspection. The number 1 and 2 engine cowls completely departed the aircraft during the accident sequence. Several cowl sections were found on the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport runway; two cowling sections were also found in a residential area in the Browns Point area of Tacoma, Washington, approximately 10 nautical miles south-southwest of the airport. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""Inadequate inspection of the number 1 and 2 engine cowls by company maintenance personnel and inadequate preflight inspection by the flight engineer, resulting in unsecured cowls separating from the aircraft during takeoff.

On this flight, there would also be the final evaluation of the first officer, with a view to  promotion to captain. The flight took place normally, without any abnormalities until the moment of landing. The weather conditions of the destination were poor with rain, strong wind with gusts and windshear indications in the vicinity of the airport. The aircraft performed the NDB ECHO 2 approach for runway 29. During the landing, the aircraft floated over the runway, touching down approximately 1000 meters past the threshold. After the touchdown, the aircraft ran for about 1400 metres before it suffered a runway excursion and collided with a ditch. The aircraft suffered severe damage. Contributing factors a. Human Factor (1) Physiological Aspect - Did Not Contribute (2) Psychological Aspect - Contributed From the knowledge of the prevailing weather conditions, it was possible for pilots to predict the possibility of ""windshear"" in the aerodrome area. In the meantime, they proceeded to land in compliance with the company's operational standards. b. Material Factor - No contribution c. Operational Factor (1) Adverse Weather Conditions - Contributed Adverse meteorological phenomena, with regard to the tailwind component, cross wind  and heavy rain, substantially interfered with the operation of the aircraft in the landing phase, leading to abnormal circumstances and loss of ground control. (2) Poor Infrastructure - Contributed The meteorological information reported to the aircraft was being obtained from measuring points located in the control tower, and not in the vicinity of the runway.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CENIPA Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Zero Hora   Location  Images: photo (c) FÃ¡bio LuÃ­s Fonseca; Porto Alegre - Salgado Filho; 28 February 2000 photo (c) FÃ¡bio LuÃ­s Fonseca; Porto Alegre - Salgado Filho; 28 February 2000 photo (c) FÃ¡bio LuÃ­s Fonseca; Porto Alegre - Salgado Filho; 28 February 2000 photo (c) Ricardo Chaves/Zero Hora; Porto Alegre - Salgado Filho; 27 February 2000 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

At the same time, the flight engineer was reconfiguring the airplane's electrical system from a Category III landing to a Category I landing.  When the flight engineer closed the ""number one bus-tie-breaker,"" the airplane experienced an uncommanded pitch-up, accompanied by numerous momentary instrument failures.  Twelve occupants were injured.  The airplane was utilizing the ""A"" autopilot system, which remained engaged.  The pilot disconnected the autopilot, leveled the airplane, re-engaged the autopilot, and continued to an uneventful landing.  During a ferry flight, maintenance personnel were able to duplicate a ""sudden pitch-up"" while using the airplane's ""B"" autopilot system, and closing the ""number two bus-tie-breaker."" Additionally, the flight crew reported that the airplane ""felt light in pitch.""  Examination of data obtained from the flight data recorder and optical quick access recorder revealed an electrical discontinuity around the time of the pitch-up. An inspection of the airplane revealed that the number 1 and 2, elevator feel computer pitot connections were capped.  Review of the airplane's maintenance history revealed that the airplane had recently undergone an ""inter 2 check"" at a British Airways maintenance facility.  During that time, maintenance personnel disconnected the pitot connections to the elevator feel computer in order to perform pitot static system checks.  The effect of the disconnected pitot-static lines on the elevator feel computer would have resulted in a more extreme travel of the elevator control surface.  The calculated expected autopilot elevator authority for the accident flight was about 4 degrees.  The estimated actual elevator deflection during the accident sequence was 6.87 degrees nose up, and 6.97 degrees nose down.  Review of the Boeing basic airplane maintenance manual section that detailed the pitot-static system checks revealed a test to confirm that the elevator feel computer was reconnected and functioned.  The test was not present the maintenance manual utilized by British Airways, which was provided by Boeing.  The source of the pitch-up command to the autopilot was not determined; however, when the autopilot system was properly configured, the pitch-up characteristics were not objectionable and within expected values. Probable Cause: Maintenance personnel's failure to reconnect the pitot connections to the elevator feel computer which resulted in an elevator control surface deflection which was outside of the normal autopilot elevator authority.  The uncommanded autopilot input to the elevator control surface resulted from an undetermined electrical source.  A factor in this accident was that the section of the 747 Maintenance Manuel utilized by company maintenance personnel did not contain an ""elevator feel light test.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NYC00LA085 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB NYC00LA085 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates03-May-2024 10:26 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

When still turning onto the main runway the crew already reported ready for takeoff. Flaps were erroneously selected at 11 degrees instead of 20 degrees. At a speed of 165 km/h during takeoff the began to rotate the aircraft. It attained a 13-degree angle of attack and climbed to a height of 8-10 metres when it stalled. The airplane rolled left and struck the ground with a 60-65 degree bank angle and crashed.Sources: MAK Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC)   Location  Images: photo (c) Lukas Lusser; Moskva-Sheremetyevo Airport (SVO); 20 August 1997 photo (c) Miklos Szabo; Budapest-Ferihegy Airport (BUD); 10 June 1999 photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Praha-Ruzyne International Airport (PRG/LKPR); October 1999 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The ILS approach to runway 18 (6,299 x 150 feet, contaminated with ice, and -.611% gradient) at Jackson Hole Airport was performed with a 6.5 knot tailwind.  During the landing roll, the captain used the emergency braking system, which deactivated the anti-skid protection.  At mid-field, the airplane slid left, then slid right, and then left back to the runway centerline where the captain said he continued braking.  The airplane continued beyond the end of the runway for 160 feet into snow approximately 2 feet deep.  The manufacturer's Airplane Flight Manual indicates that when emergency braking is utilized, the anti-skid protection is deactivated.  The CVR recorded a 'high pitch' sound at 0839:44, which was the high-pressure air of the emergency braking system being activated.  The Airplane Flight Manual also limits landing on contaminated runways to the following: A. Winds must be zero or a headwind of less than 30 knots (i.e. no tailwind); B. The runway gradient must be between -1% and  2.2%; and C. The anti-skid system must be operational. Probable Cause: The pilot not following the airplane manufacturer's recommended landing procedures for a contaminated runway by landing with a tailwind.  Factors were the pilot's inadvertent deactivation of the anti-skid protection, the ice contaminated runway, and the snow covered terrain beyond the runway.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DEN00LA057 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DEN00LA057 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates16-Oct-2022 04:17 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

The first segment of the flight from Lagos (LOS) to Abuja (ABV) was flown by the Commander. The aircraft departed Lagos about 06:30 hours UTC and initially at cruise, the crew had a momentary problem setting power on the starboard engine after which the flight continued normally to Abuja.  The aircraft which departed Abuja for Jos (JOS) at 09:00 hours UTC first officer at the controls. At FL 90 and about 30NM from Abuja, the crew again had problems with the cruise power setting on the starboard engine. The torque remained at 1400. The crew retarded the right power lever to the minimum with the aim of achieving a cruise setting of 1300 but the gear warning came on. The Commander at this stage took over the controls from the first officer. At 09:23 hours UTC, the aircraft contacted Kaduna Tower that it would be diverting to Kaduna (KAD) giving its flight level as 90 at a distance of 61 miles and estimating TMA at 24 miles, 'KC' at 41 miles, 6 souls on board and 5 hours endurance at departure. The tower then gave the aircraft an inbound clearance to 'KC' locator maintaining FL 90 and to expect no delay for a locator approach runway 05. Weather report at 09:00 hours UTC was also passed to the aircraft as wind 090/05 knots, QNH 1014 and temperature 30Â°C. At 09:28 hours UTC the airplane at about 42 miles, speed between 150-160 kts, requested descent and was cleared to 4,500ft, QNH 1014. At about 09:35 hours UTC, the pilots contacted tower that they would make a single engine approach because they were having problems controlling power on the starboard engine and it would be shut down.  The commander then reviewed the single engine approach with the first officer estimating 4,500 ft at 8NM. Approaching 4,500 ft at 11 NM, the crew initiated right engine shut down after which the speed was decayed from 150 to 140 kts. At 09:46 hours UTC, the pilot reported 6nm final and field in sight while the tower requested him to report 4 miles final. The controller reported having the aircraft in sight and subsequently cleared it to land on runway 05 giving wind as north easterly 06 knots. Descending at 500ft/min, the commander requested for 25% of flap when the first officer selected full flap. When the aircraft was at 2,700 ft high, the speed had already decayed to between 100 - 110 kts. The crew applied full power on the port engine to arrest the speed decay but to no avail. The pilot was trying to correct the descent rate, speed decay and the asymmetry when the stall warning came on.  The aircraft belly landed and struck the new VOR/DME site being constructed about 1175 m from the threshold of runway 05. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The probable cause of this accident was the poor handling by the crew of the one-engine inoperative approach.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIPB Report number: 04/375 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources: ICAO Adrep File : 00000870   Location  Images: photo (c) AIPB Nigeria; Kaduna Airport (KAD); March 2000 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The ice strip on the lake was 2700 feet approximate in length, 150 feet wide. The aircraft was observed to touch down nearly halfway along the ice strip, the tail of the aircraft remained in the air, and the aircraft took off almost immediately. The main landing gear was seen to retract. The aircraft reached the end of the runway then abruptly entered a steep, nose-up attitude, banked sharply to the left, turned left, and descended into the ice. The left wing made first contact with the ice. The aircraft rotated around the left wing and struck the ice in a steep, nose-down attitude about 400 feet from the end of the ice strip. FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: - The pilot lost control of the aircraft while conducting a go-around from a balked landing on an ice strip. - The aircraft's centre of gravity (C of G) on the accident flight was beyond the aft C of G limit. - The actual C of G of the aircraft at basic operating weight was 16.7 inches aft of the C of G provided in the weight and balance report. - The load sheet index number used by the crew was inaccurate. - The stack of 2x4 lumber was inadequately secured and may have shifted rearward during the go-around. - The crew did not recalculate the aircraft's weight and balance for the second flight. - Leaks in the heater shroud allowed carbon monoxide gas to contaminate cockpit and cabin air. - The captain's carboxyhaemoglobin level was 17.9 per cent, which may have adversely affected his performance, especially his decision making and his visual acuity.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: TSB Report A00C0059 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Both crewmembers said they never saw the tug until after the collision, and when the aircraft door was opened, they realized that the baggage vehicle had collided with their aircraft. The police report showed that the pilot had said in his initial report, that he felt as if the left wing had been pushed hard and he had observed that the aircraft's left propeller and wing, as well as the rear baggage carts were damaged. The police report also showed that the baggage cart had been equipped with no lights, only reflectors, and that the distance from the center of the yellow taxi line to the impact point where the debris lay was about 30 feet. In addition, a ramp control incident report showed that in addition to the debris being located 30 feet from the yellow line, the debris was also located 73 feet from the aircraft containment line. The tug driver stated that he had been driving as close to the fuchsia (red) line as was possible, when the collision occurred. The ramp supervisor who was marshalling the aircraft and witnessed the collision stated that he was 100 feet away, and observed that the tug and cart was coming from the left side of the aircraft, trying to cross the taxiway from one side to the other, and the tug driver did not notice the aircraft taxiing in, and tried to avoid hitting the aircraft by making a turn to the left, but he hit the airplane with the cart, causing damage to the airplane's left wing and propeller.

Prior to starting the approach, the flightcrew determined that the landing approach speed (Vref) and the approach speed (Vapp) were 122 and 128 knots, respectively. The airplane flying on autopilot passed the middle marker at 200 feet AGL at 130 knots on the ILS approach. Approximately 3 seconds after the first officer called ""runway in sight twelve o'clock,"" the captain disconnected the autopilot, while at a radio altitude of 132 feet and on a heading of approximately 18 degrees. Within approximately 11 seconds after the autopilot disconnect, the glideslope and localizer deviation increased. The first officer called ""runway over there.""

The departure and en route portions of the flight to Fox Harbour were unremarkable until preparation for the descent. The owner of the IAI Astra jet had made it clear to this crew, and to other crews on previous occasions, that he expected arrivals and approaches to be flown in minimum time. The operating crew and other employees confirmed this pressure, and aircrew therefore planned and conducted their operations accordingly. In preparation for the arrival and the approach to Fox Harbour, the crew inserted a series of waypoints in the flight management system to guide them for a straight-in approach and landing on runway 33. In general, the descent was flown at high speed on a track following the navigation waypoints programmed in the flight management system by the crew. Speed brakes were required to slow the aircraft during the descent. Example speeds show that the aircraft was at 340 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS) at 10 000 feet, 310 KIAS at 5000 feet, and 250 KIAS at 1000 feet. At 1000 feet, the aircraft was levelled and decelerated to configure for approach and landing. About this time, there was a slight quartering tailwind component, estimated to be about six knots. Because the speed was high throughout the descent, flaps and landing gear selections were delayed and, consequently, not fully extended until about three miles from the runway. At this time, the co-pilot went ""heads down"" to ensure that all checklist items were complete and to confirm that the aircraft was properly configured to land. When he next looked up, he observed that the aircraft was low in relationship to the runway and advised the captain, who corrected by levelling the aircraft. The aircraft altitude was recorded on radar to be between 200 and 300 feet above sea level while tracking inbound to the airport. A short distance before the tree line the aircraft began descending again. The co-pilot saw trees between the aircraft and the runway and called for an overshoot. The captain had begun the overshoot on the co-pilot's call; however, the action was not taken in time to avoid striking the trees. About 50 feet above ground level and 1300 feet from the threshold of runway 33, the aircraft struck the trees and descended 10 feet into the treetops, then climbed away. Damage to the aircraft comprised wing leading-edge dents, minor fuselage perforations, leading- and trailing-edge flap dents and perforations, nose and landing-gear door damage, and foreign object damage to both engines. Tree debris was entangled in the landing gear; some of this debris fell from the aircraft during the overshoot. Debris that entered the engines subsequently resulted in an odour of burning wood and some smoke in the cabin. Once the aircraft began climbing on the overshoot, the crew raised the landing gear and the trailing-edge flaps. Both systems functioned normally. The initial decision to raise the landing gear and the flaps was re-examined during the overshoot climb, resulting in the leading-edge flaps being left extended. The crew contacted air traffic control on the overshoot, declared an emergency, and requested clearance to Charlottetown. Charlottetown was chosen because it was nearby and clearly visible from Fox Harbour, had landing aids, and had airport emergency response services. The aircraft continued to Charlottetown for a straight-in approach and an uneventful landing and shutdown. FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1. Conditions conducive to black-hole illusion were present during the night approach to the runway. 2. In this situation, the crew did not recognize the potential hazard of the black-hole illusion and therefore did not compensate for it. 3. The crew did not adhere to the required standard operating procedures for the preparation and execution of the approach. Consequently, the crew were inadequately prepared for the visual conditions on final approach. FINDINGS AS TO RISK: 1. The high descent and intermediate approach speeds caused cockpit pre-landing checks to be delayed. This delay resulted in the co-pilot's attention being diverted inside the cockpit when approach monitoring should have been done. 2. The crew's decision to raise the landing gear and the flaps on the overshoot after hitting the trees increased the risk to the flight.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A00A0051 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: TSB Report Number A00A0051 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  5 February 2010 C-FRJZ Jetport Inc. 0 In flight near Hamilton, Ontario min Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

It landed in Bangkok-Don Muang International Airport (BKK), Thailand after an uneventful flight. The same flight crew made the return flight back to Colombo after 4 hours and 20 minutes ground time in Bangkok. The crew had received the weather report prior to departure. The aircraft was refueled adding 6681 kg of fuel to the remaining 8300 kg bringing the total fuel onboard to 14981 kg. Flight SCB 702 departed Bangkok. The scheduled flight time for Bangkok - Colombo was five hours and twenty minutes with a scheduled time of arrival of 17:00 hours. SCB 702 made the first radio contact with Sri Lanka air traffic control at 16:16. The area controller passed SCB702 the latest weather report effective for Colombo. At 16:40 the controller radioed: ""There is a sigmet valid up to 1415 UTC, Colombo FIR CBs, Thunderstorms were found having tops up to FL360 over Sri Lanka including Colombo and Ratmalana airfields and now contact Colombo Director on 132.4 Mhz."" When the crew contacted the approach radar controller (Director) they were asked to report the radial and DME from Colombo, (i.e. from ""DVOR/DME KAT""). SCB 702 reported as saying ""074 radial and 55 DME ready for descent"". Later, flight SCB 702 made two unsuccessful ILS approaches to runway 04. While on a radar heading to get established on the ILS to runway 22 for a third attempt to land, all four engines stopped. The propellers were feathered and the aircraft entered a controlled glide. It cut through several coconut trees before crashing on the houses. The left wing had separated first. The right wing then separated as well. Both wings lost all engines in the process.  There had been two isolated minor fires where the main wing tank and the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) were found. Both the fires had not spread to other areas and had extinguished on its own. CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT: The aircraft accident occurred due to fuel starvation. Contributory factors to the accident are as follows. i) Violation of Air Navigation Regulations on fuel planning; ii) Failure of the flight crew to declare an emergency; iii) Being unable to land due to adverse weather situation; iv) Lack of communicability of the flight crew in English language; v) Non-availability of established air traffic control procedures to assist an aircraft in distress; vi) Failure of Skycabs (Pvt.)

No injuries reported to the passengers and crew (exact numbers of passengers and crew not reported).  ""Towards the end of the taxi out to the hold for Runway 9R, which was reported to have been conducted at speeds no higher than 9 knots, the crew heard a loud bang and felt a slight âbumpâ. Almost immediately all of the anti-skid warning lights associated with the right wing landing gear illuminated on the flight deck. About this time a passenger informed the cabin crew that he had seen a tyre roll from under the aircraft across the grass, between the taxiway and the runway.  The aircraft stopped at the holding point and was duly inspected by airport personnel. It was evident that the inboard rim of the No 2 wheel (front inboard wheel of the left wing landing gear) had completely detached from the wheel and this had allowed the tyre to come off. After wheels Nos 1 and 2 had been changed, the aircraft was towed back to the gate where the passengers disembarked normally"" Further examination of the aircraft revealed that fragments of the failed inboard rim had been jettisoned by the released inboard wall of the tyre and caused impact damage to the right main gear door, the right wing landing gear and its folding door. In addition, a wiring conduit which was mounted on the right wing gear drag brace, and contained the anti-skid units wiring, had been severed in two places.

The captain advised the first flight attendant to expect turbulence.  He turned on the fasten seat belt sign, and he directed that cabin service be suspended and the service carts stowed.  The first flight attendant notified the other flight attendants of the captain's instructions.  She stated that she directed them to ""stop service and take their seats immediately.""  The flight attendants secured the cabin, which took a few minutes. However, they had not taken their seats when the airplane encountered several jolts of moderate turbulence.  The airplane's flight data recorder indicated that within a 1/2-second period the vertical acceleration changed from -0.05G to  2.37Gs.  The first flight attendant (front cabin) was knocked off her feet.  The three flight attendants in the aft galley were thrown upward but did not strike the ceiling before coming back down and falling to the floor.  One was seriously injured.  The operator's ""InFlight Operations Manual"" required the flight crew to use standard terminology during briefings to the flight attendants.  The descriptive terms include usage of the words ""light, moderate, or severe"" when describing expected turbulence.  Neither the captain nor any of the flight attendants reported having used/heard these terms regarding the anticipated turbulence intensity.

CAUSE: During a non-scheduled commercial flight, during landing, the aircraft deviated to the left of the runway and one of the blades of the No. 1 propeller impacted a beacon, due to an inadequate sequence in the activation of the engine controls and propeller pitch.Sources: http://www.jiaac.gob.ar/files/pdf/Bol30.pdf  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates23-May-2023 21:28 harro Updated Corrections or additions? ...

Flight 541 departed Manila (MNL) at 05:21 hours and was due to land at Davao (DVO), Philippines, around 06:45.  The aircraft was being flown as a route check for a captain. Another captain was acting as Pilot Monitoring on the flight. The en route part of the flight was uneventful. The aircraft was conducting an ILS approach to runway 05 and the controller reported that they would be behind Philippine Airlines flight 809, an Airbus A319. As the Boeing 737 broke out of clouds, the A319 was observed on runway 05. The Pilot Flying informed ATC of his intention to perform a 360Â° maneuver, but the Pilot Monitoring advised ATC of the opposite, stating that the aircraft would turn right instead of following the missed approach procedure, which called for a left hand turn to a 020Â° heading. The aircraft re-entered clouds and attempted to fly visually at a lower altitude in instrument conditions when in fact it should have climbed to 4000 feet.  The flight continued over Samal Island and the flight requested a VOR/DME approach and landing in the opposite direction (runway 23), which was approved by the controller. After having aligned with the runway heading, the aircraft descended below the normal glide path for this approach. It continued down to 570 feet at a point where the aircraft should have been at 1500 feet. The aircraft crashed into a coconut plantation on a hillside in Barangay San Isidro, disintegrated and caught fire.Sources: AP  ICAO Adrep  Nolan News, Fall 08  Philippine Daily Inquirer  The Philippine STAR   Location  Images: photo (c) Erik Oxtorp, via Werner Fischdick; Manila-Ninoy Aquino International Airport (MNL); June 1999 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates05-Jan-2025 19:52 ASN Updated [Narrative, ]10-Feb-2025 07:40 ASN Updated The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The 3-man cockpit crew, 11-person cabin crew, and 220 passengers were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. An instrument flight rules flight plan had been filed for the flight, between Newark and Brussels Airport (BRU), Belgium.  Startup and taxi were normal, and during the taxi, the captain again briefed the cockpit crew, and included engine failures, as well as ""non-reject"" situations. The airplane lined up on runway 04L, and the captain applied takeoff power slowly and smoothly. At takeoff decision speed (V1), there was a loud explosion. A white ""engine fail"" light illuminated in front of the captain, and the number 1 engine N1 decreased by 30 percent. Number 2 and number 3 engines appeared normal.  The captain continued the takeoff, and the landing gear was raised. A red, left main landing gear warning light illuminated on the front panel. The airplane turned to a heading of 010, and slowly climbed to 3,000 feet. During the climb, an airframe vibration developed.  After level-off, the crew began to troubleshoot the emergency, and found that when the number 3 engine N1 was reduced, the vibration disappeared. Both the number 1 and the number 3 engines remained at reduced power, in relation to number 2, for the rest of the flight.  Air traffic control personnel provided vectors for a return to Newark. During the return, the crew dumped about 90,000 pounds of fuel. The crew also ran both 1-engine, and 2-engine inoperative checklists, and prepared data cards for both scenarios.  The captain flew the ILS glideslope down to a full-stop landing, on runway 04R at 20:16. After stopping on the runway, the brakes would not release, so the crew shut down the engines, and the passengers and crew disembarked through the normal deplaning doors. The airplane was later towed to a ramp.

The aircraft was then prepared for Crossair flight 498 to Dresden. Germany. Taxi clearance was given at 17:50 and the crew taxied to runway 28. The crew expected to be cleared for a standard instrument departure SID ZUE 1Y. This procedure calls for the aircraft to climb straight ahead heading 280 and then make a left turn to cross overhead the airport at the KLO VOR and then assume a heading of 054Â° onto airway R234 to the Zurich East (ZUE) beacon. At 17:54 the aircraft was cleared for takeoff. Takeoff and climb were conducted with flaps at 0 degrees, which is normal for a Saab 340 departing from runway 28. The aircraft climbed normally at 136 knots IAS. After retracting the gear the Flight Director was switched on. While climbing through 2500 feet QNH the crew switched to Zurich Departure Control and were recleared to climb to FL110. At 17:55 the crew were cleared to make a left turn to intercept airway R234. A left turn was initiated, during which the first officer entered a command in the Flight Management System (FMS) to ZUE. The command ""direct to (DTO) Â left Â ZUE"" however was programmed only as ""direct to Â ZUE"". The programming was performed by the first officer alone, without the prescribed monitoring and checking by the captain. The latter was absorbed in manually flying the aircraft.  After having turned left for 7 seconds the captain started a right turn, consistent with Flight Director commands generated by the FMS for a 'direct to ZUE' as the right hand turn was the shortest.  In clouds the aircraft continued a right roll, which at 17:56:14 reached a right bank angle of 65.8Â°. The first officer advised the captain that the aircraft should actually turn to the left. This was also noted by the Zurich departure controller at 17:56:20, who asked the crew about the direction of the turn. The first officer replied: ""Moment please, stand by"". Upon which the Departure controller recleared the flight to continue the right turn direct to ZUE. By then the pitch had also decreased rapidly, accompanied by a marked speed increase and the Saab entered a high speed high-rate spiral descent. At 17:56:28 the aircraft crashed in an open field. Weather reported included temperature 2deg C; dew point 1deg C; 1032 mB wind WNW/3 knots and light drizzle. CAUSES: ""The accident is attributable to a collision with the ground, after the flight crew had lost control of the aircraft for the following reasons: - The flight crew reacted inappropriately to the change in departure clearance SID ZUE 1Y by ATC. - The co-pilot made an entry in the FMS, without being instructed to do so by the commander, which related to the change to the SID ZUE 1 standard instrument departure. In doing so, he omitted to select a turn direction. - The commander dispensed with use of the autopilot under instrument flight conditions and during the work-intensive climb phase of the flight. - The commander took the aircraft into a spiral dive to the right because, with a probability bordering on certainty, he had lost spatial orientation. - The first officer took only inadequate measures to prevent or recover from the spiral dive. The following factors may have contributed to the accident: - The commander remained unilaterally firm in perceptions which suggested a left turn direction to him. - When interpreting the attitude display instruments under stress, the commander resorted to a reaction pattern (heuristics) which he had learned earlier. - The commanderÂs capacity for analysis and critical assessment of the situation were possibly limited as a result of the effects of medication. - After the change to standard instrument departure SID ZUE 1Y the crew set inappropriate priorities for their tasks and their concentration remained one-sided. - The commander was not systematically acquainted by Crossair with the specific features of western systems and cockpit procedures.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BFU Switz.

The descent from FL70 was started at 14:25. Eleven minutes later both engines flamed out. The aircraft was ditched off the Libyan coast in a 10deg nose up attitude. The tail broke off and the wreckage sank inverted to a depth of 38 m, about 3 miles from the coast.  According to the Libyan investigation report, the first officer and co-pilot, who both survived, were so busy talking about how to fly the Fokker F-28 aircraft that they failed to switch on the anti-icing system for the engines as weather conditions deteriorated. As the aircraft came in to land, ice that had been allowed to build up melted, flooding the engines and cutting off the power. A device that might have restarted the engines was not switched on. There were no lifejackets on board and many of the dead drowned because they were unaware that their seat cushions doubled as floats.

The aircraft had a full load of passengers which meant that there would be little time for the cabin crew to carry out full service program on the shorter than normal flight.  After departure the seat belt sign remained on for approximately five minutes due to turbulence in the climb-out. Ten minutes before landing, when the commander turned on the ""fasten seat belt sign"", two cabin attendants were standing in the aft galley stowing their service carts. One cabin attendant was leaning slightly forward to lock a cart in place when the aircraft was through about in the turbulence. She flew up in the air and landed on the floor on her back with the right leg under her. She received help during the remainder of the flight and was then brought to hospital.  After examination in the hospital it was determined that she had suffered three fractures in her right ankle. Conclusion Turbulence was experienced during the flight. The sudden severe shaking that was felt caused the C/A to lose her balance and fall, breaking her ankle. Contributing to the accident onboard was the fact that the short flight time provided little opportunity for the cabin attendants to complete the normal service program for a fully seated flight and then be seated with their seat belts fastened in good time prior to the landing. SHK considers that the need for serving a complete service program on short flights in turbulent weather can be questioned from a safety point of view.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: SHK Report number: RL 2000:17e Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: ICAO  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates19-Sep-2024 05:54 ASN Added 19-Sep-2024 06:20 ASN Updated [Operator, Location, Departure airport, Destination airport, Narrative, Category, Accident report, ] Corrections or additions? ...

During the descent and vectors for the approach to runway 31R at Love Field, the airplane began to accumulate moderate clear ice, and a master warning light illumination in the cockpit indicated that the horizontal stabilizer heat had failed. The crew continued the approach to get the airplane out of the icing conditions and on the ground as soon as possible. Considering the possibility of additional ice accumulation on the horizontal stabilizer, the crew, per the flight manual abnormal procedures checklist, configured the airplane for a touchdown speed of 120 knots in lieu of 108 knots, and a flap extension of 10 degrees in lieu of 30 degrees. The aircraft touched down approximately 1,500 feet down the runway and the captain began applying the brakes. The captain reported that the aircraft did not have any braking action for approximately 3,000 feet and the anti-skid was not pulsing. With about 1,500 feet of runway remaining, it looked to the captain like there would not be enough available runway to stop the aircraft. Beyond the departure end of the runway, there was a steep down hill embankment and support poles for the approach lights for runway 13L. The captain forced the aircraft to depart the right side of the runway to avoid the poles. After the aircraft started down the embankment, the nose gear collapsed and the airplane came to rest. The wreckage was sold to Dodson International Parts and was last seen at their Rantoul, KS scrapyard in September 2005.

The crew initiated their descent at a 'later than normal distance' from the airport, and as a result, a power reduction below 25 percent torque was required, which set off the gear warning horn.  The sound 'eventually became part of the background noise.'  During the approach, the captain asked the tower to dim the runway lights.  At that time, the runway and approach lights went out and the crew lost sight of the runway.  While the captain was asking the tower to turn the lights back on, the first officer called 'gear down, syncs off, speeds high, below the line check list.'  The captain did not hear the first officer's callout and did not lower the landing gear.  The captain stated that he did not hear the first officer's callout 'either because of the conversation [he] was having with the tower or because of the intercom system difficulties.'  As the approach continued, the first officer had a problem slowing the airplane to proper approach speed.  The airplane touched down on the runway with the landing gear retracted, 'slid' about 2,500 feet and exited the left side of the runway. Probable Cause: The flight crew's failure to extend the landing gear.  Contributing factors were the flight crew's non-compliance with the checklist, the pilot-in-command's diverted attention as a result of the loss of instrument approach/runway lighting, the partial failure of the instrument approach/runway lighting system, and the partial failure of the intercom system.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: FTW00LA078 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB FTW00LA078 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates16-Oct-2022 05:46 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

Flight KQ430 departed from Nairobi for a flight to Lagos and Abidjan. Due to the harmattan, a dusty seasonal wind from the deserts of north Africa, the flight continued directly to Abidjan. The aircraft, named ""Harambee Star"", landed there at 15:15 local time.  The Airbus was prepared for the return flight, KQ431, to Lagos and Nairobi that evening. Shortly after 21:00 the crew received clearance to taxy to runway 21 for departure. The trim was set at 0.9 nose up, slats and flaps at 15 degrees. The airplane began to taxi at 21:07, the tower controller informed the crew of the latest wind, cleared them to take off and asked the crew the call back when they reached flight level 40. At 21:08:18, the captain, who was pilot non flying, applied takeoff power and announced ""thrust, SRS, and runway"" then, nine seconds later ""100 knots"". Flight 431 took off and at 21:08:57, the copilot announced ""Positive rate of climb, gear up"". Less than two seconds later, at a height of around 300 feet, the stall warning sounded. The gear was not retracted. The copilot, who was the pilot flying, pushed forward on the control column in reaction to the stall warnings. At 21:09:07, the copilot asked, ""What's the problem?"" The aircraft descended and less than a second before passing through 100 feet in descent, the copilot ordered the aural stall warning alarm to be disconnected. The GPWS sounded briefly, followed by the CRC (Continuous Repetitive Chime), which corresponds to a master warning of over-speed with flaps extended, immediately followed by an order from the captain ""Go up!"". The airplane's speed at this point was at least 210 knots, the maximum speed limit for a configuration with slats/flaps at 15Â°/15Â°. At 21:09:24 the airplane contacted the sea and broke up. The wreckage came to rest on the sandy seabed at a depth of 40-50 metres. Just ten of the 179 occupants survived the accident. CAUSES OF THE ACCIDENT:  ""The Commission of Inquiry concluded that the cause of the accident to flight KQ 431 on 30 January 2000 was a collision with the sea that resulted from the pilot flying applying one part of the procedure, by pushing forward on the control column to stop the stick shaker, following the initiation of a stall warning on rotation, while the airplane was not in a true stall situation. In fact, the FCOM used by the airline states that whenever a stall warning is encountered at low altitude (stick shaker activation), it should be considered as an immediate threat to the maintenance of a safe flight path. It specifies that at the first sign of an imminent stall or at the time of a stick shaker activation, the following actions must be undertaken simultaneously: thrust levers in TOGA position, reduction of pitch attitude, wings level, check that speed brakes are retracted. The investigation showed that the pilot flying reduced the pitch attitude but did not apply TOGA thrust on the engines. The investigation was unable to determine if the crew performed the other two actions: leveling the wings and checking that the speed brakes were retracted. The following elements contributed to the accident: - the pilot flying's action on the control column put the airplane into a descent without the crew realizing it, despite the radio altimeter callouts; - the GPWS warnings that could have alerted the crew to an imminent contact with the sea were masked by the priority stall and overspeed warnings, in accordance with the rules on the prioritization of warnings; - the conditions for a takeoff performed towards the sea and at night provided no external visual references that would have allowed the crew to be aware of the direct proximity of the sea.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CoI Ivory Coast Report number: Report 5y-n000130 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 12 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: ICAO Adrep Summary 2/00 (#4)   Location  Images: photo (c) Commission of Inquiry; near Abidjan; 30 January 2000 photo (c) Sarah Ward; London-Heathrow Airport (LHR); 1987 photo (c) Peter Frei; ZÃ¼rich-Kloten Airport (ZRH); 08 August 1992 photo (c) Reinhard Zinabold, via Werner Fischdick; Amsterdam-Schiphol Airport (AMS); September 1999 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates02-Jan-2025 09:06 ASN Updated [Phase, Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Flight AS261 departed Puerto Vallarta at about 14:30 PST for a flight to San Francisco and Seattle. En route to San Francisco a FL310 a problem arose with the stabilizer trim. At 16:10 the crew radioed Los Angeles ARTCC that they were having control problems and that they were descending through FL260. At 16:11 Los Angeles ARTCC asked the condition of the flight and were told that they were troubleshooting a jammed stabilizer. The crew requested, and were granted, a FL200-FL250 block altitude clearance. At 16:15 the crew were handed off to Los Angeles sector control. The Alaska Airlines crew reported problems maintaining their altitude and told their intentions to divert to Los Angeles International Airport. They were cleared to do so at 16:16. The crew then requested permission to descend to FL100 over water to change their aircraft configuration . Los Angeles cleared them to FL170. Last message from Flight 261 was when they requested another block altitude. The request was granted at 16:17, without a readback from the crew. During the descent the crew was also talking to Alaska Airlines maintenance personnel in Seattle and Los Angeles to troubleshoot their stabilizer trim problems. As the crew attempted to diagnose or correct the problem the out-of-trim condition became worse, causing a tendency for the plane to pitch nose-down. When preparing the plane for landing control was lost and the MD-83 was seen 'tumbling, spinning, nose down, continuous roll, corkscrewing and inverted'. The aircraft crashed off Point Mugu in 650 feet deep water. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""A loss of airplane pitch control resulting from the in-flight failure of the horizontal stabilizer trim system jackscrew assemblyÂs acme nut threads. The thread failure was caused by excessive wear resulting from Alaska AirlinesÂ insufficient lubrication of the jackscrew assembly. Contributing to the accident were Alaska AirlinesÂ extended lubrication interval and the Federal Aviation AdministrationÂs (FAA) approval of that extension, which increased the likelihood that a missed or inadequate lubrication would result in excessive wear of the acme nut threads, and Alaska AirlinesÂ extended end play check interval and the FAAÂs approval of that extension, which allowed the excessive wear of the acme nut threads to progress to failure without the opportunity for detection. Also contributing to the accident was the absence on the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 of a fail-safe mechanism to prevent the catastrophic effects of total acme nut thread loss.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NTSB/AAR-02-01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) U.S. Department of Defense; off Point Mugu, CA photo (c) NTSB; off Point Mugu, CA; 2000; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; off Point Mugu, CA photo (c) NTSB; off Point Mugu, CA photo (c) Marlo Plate; Los Angeles International Airport, CA (LAX); August 1999 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates02-Jan-2025 09:08 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

On approaching Filitheyo Seaplane Base, the captain realized that the GPS position fed to the system was that of the resort island (Filitheyo), not the GPS position of the landing site near Filitheyo resort (Dhiguvaru Falhu) which is about 2.5 miles (4 km) north of Filitheyo. The captain, until he was about to land was busy in correcting the GPS co-ordinates for the landing site. On landing on water the aircraft sprung back and the captain realized that the landing gear was down. The aircraft bounced back and flipped onto its back pivoting the nose and left wing.

When it went dark en route to Mwanza, the radio altimeter integral light was found to be unserviceable. The crew were not able to fix the problem and the continued using the FMS. The crew contacted Mwanza tower at 16:58 and were being advised that there was no power at the airport and that efforts were being made to use a standby generator. Further information passed on the crew reportedly included VOR, DME and NDB all unserviceable, weather: wind calm, 8 km visibility, temperature 25deg C and QNH 1015. After holding for 10 minutes, the airport generator came on and the runway lights went on. The first officer, who was pilot flying, started a visual runway 12 approach. When well established on finals with full landing configuration, the captain told the f/o that he was too low, and a few seconds later he told the f/o he was too high. Both the captain and the flight engineer then told the f/o to go around. The f/o overshot and climbed to 5500 feet on the downwind leg. Turning on the left base the captain remarked that the turn was too tight: "".. I will do a 360-degree turn to the right and position you finals"". The captain thus took over control and started a right turn at 4400 feet. Just before completing the turn, the f/o said: ""do not go down anymore, the altimeter is reading 4100 feet"". Almost aligned with the runway, the f/o took over control again. At that same moment the aircraft bounced 2 or 3 times yawing to the left and came down to a halt in the middle of the lake.Sources: AIB Bulletin 1/00  Aviation Week & Space Technology 06.03.2000  Graham Tanner  ICAO Adrep Summary 2/00 (#24)  NTSB  Panafrican news Agency  Tommy Maurer   Location  Images: photo (c) unknown; Mwanza Airport (MWZ); February 2000 photo (c) unknown; Mwanza Airport (MWZ); February 2000 photo (c) unknown; Mwanza Airport (MWZ); February 2000 photo (c) unknown; Mwanza Airport (MWZ); February 2000 photo (c) unknown; Mwanza Airport (MWZ); February 2000 photo (c) unknown; Mwanza Airport (MWZ); February 2000 photo (c) unknown; Mwanza Airport (MWZ); February 2000 photo (c) unknown; Mwanza Airport (MWZ); February 2000 photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Miami International Airport, FL (MIA); February 1993 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The same flight crew flew the airplane from Atlanta to El Salvador and back to Atlanta.  Another flight crew boarded the airplane and continued on to Los Angeles.  No discrepancies were reported by either of the flight crews or maintenance personnel in El Salvador and Atlanta.  After the airplane arrived in Los Angeles, a post flight walk around inspection revealed that the outside of the fuselage buckled on the left side above the nose landing gear door.  Further examination disclosed that structural members were bent and fractured in the nose wheel well.  The crew that landed in El Salvador stated that the nose gear touched down more firmly than the main landing gear.  They completed a post flight inspection, but detected no abnormalities.  The flight data recorder was removed and sent to the Safety Board's Vehicle Recorder Laboratory for readout and evaluation.  A Safety Board specialist conducted a data comparison for the landings in El Salvador, Atlanta, and Los Angeles.  In the El Salvador landing sequence, the air/ground FDR discrete indicated ""air"" then a second later indicated ""ground.""  A second later it indicate ""air"" again and then a second later indicated ""ground"" and remained ""ground"" for the remainder of the landing roll out.

During the approach for landing, when the landing gear was selected down, the main gear indication showed that the left main gear had not fully lowered. The crew checked the electrical and hydraulic systems but no fault was found. They also reported that after a fly-past of the control tower, the air traffic controller advised that the gear appeared down and locked. The crew then cycled the gear up then down and it lowered normally with the indication showing the gear down and locked. The landing at Dili was made without further incident. The flight engineer reported that he inspected the landing gear after landing at Dili and found no faults in the landing gear system. He said that he suspected that a micro switch might have been the cause of the indication. The aircraft operator did not have any maintenance personnel stationed at Dili and the crew did not report the problem to the operator's maintenance organisation. The aircraft returned to Darwin the next day. At about 1000 (CST), while the aircraft was on approach to Darwin airport, the crew lowered the landing gear. The nose and right main gear indicators showed that the respective gear was down and locked but the left main gear position indicator showed unsafe. Still suspecting an indication problem, the crew raised and lowered the landing gear several times, but the left main gear indicator continued to show an unsafe condition. The crew conducted a fly-past of the control tower and the controller confirmed that the left main gear was not down. Having confirmed that the nose and right main landing gear operated correctly and that the left main landing gear would not move, the pilot in command allocated flying duties to the copilot. The pilot in command and flight engineer conducted the checklist actions and attempted to lower the gear using the emergency procedures. The attempt to lower the gear hydraulically by using the landing gear override selector valve was unsuccessful. An attempt to lower the gear using the manual drive failed because the emergency engaging handle could not be moved. The flight engineer unsuccessfuly attempted to manually move the shift lever on the forward gearbox of the left landing gear from ""power"" to ""manual"" and the loadmaster then attempted to lower the gear by disconnecting the universal joints on the vertical torque shafts of the left landing gear. However, the castellated nuts on the bolts of both wheel vertical torque shaft universal joints could not be undone without using a spanner. Even using a spanner, only two of the four nuts had been undone after about 30 minutes. At about 1020, the crew of a C5 Galaxy military cargo aircraft also inbound to Darwin advised air traffic control that their aircraft was experiencing a hydraulic problem. Twenty minutes later, the crew of the Hercules informed air traffic control that the aircraft would be making a gear-up landing. The pilot in command requested that the airport's Rescue and Fire Fighting Service (RFFS) lay a foam path along the last two thirds of Runway 36. The air traffic controller informed the crew that a landing on Runway 29 was preferred and that the L-382 was number two in the ""emergency landing sequence"". Air traffic control intended that the Galaxy land first followed by the Hercules. The air traffic controller later informed the Hercules crew that the airport RFFS advised that laying foam was not standard procedure. The controller also advised that if foam was laid, no foam would be available to attend the aircraft after it landed. The pilot in command was concerned about the potential for fire caused by sparks during the landing and he requested a clearance from air traffic control to perform the landing on the grass alongside the runway. By the time two of the nuts on each of the universal joints had been undone, the fuel state of the Hercules was approaching 1,500 lbs or about 20 minutes endurance. The pilot in command decided that due to the low fuel state, there was insufficient time to undo the remaining nuts before a landing was required and he advised the controller of the aircraft's low fuel state. Concerned at the chances of the aircraft slewing off the runway after touchdown, the pilot in command also decided that the nose and right main landing gear would be raised for the landing. The Hercules was cleared to track for final approach Runway 29. The Galaxy diverted to the Royal Australian Air Force Base at Tindal. The pilot in command subsequently decided that it would be more prudent to land on the runway because of possible obstructions on the grass area. After briefing the passengers, the crew conducted their own emergency briefing, including actions after touchdown, shutdown actions, and evacuation routes. The pilot in command assumed control of the aircraft during final approach and conducted the gear up landing. At 1104, the Hercules landed on Runway 29. Touchdown was made at approximately 90 kts and the aircraft slid about 300 metres before stopping adjacent to Taxiway D. The aircraft remained straight on the runway and none of the crew or passengers were injured. They evacuated the aircraft soon after it came to rest. Although a flash fire erupted at the rear lower fuselage area while the aircraft slid along the runway, the fire did not spread. The RFFS applied foam to the area around the aircraft after it came to a halt.Sources: https://www.atsb.gov.au/publications/investigation_reports/2000/aair/aair200000618  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates19-Sep-2024 05:54 ASN Added 19-Sep-2024 07:00 ASN Updated [Time, Location, Nature, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The aircraft lost its number 1 and 2 engine cowlings on takeoff from Seattle. Following the separation of the cowlings, the flight returned to Seattle-Tacoma International and landed without further incident. There were no injuries. Post-accident inspection of the aircraft revealed substantial damage to the aircraft's left wing and left horizontal stabilizer.  The aircraft maintenance log indicated that on the previous flight (from Anchorage to Seattle, arriving at 07:18), the flight crew had written up discrepancies that the number 2 engine would not go into reverse thrust, and that the captain's course deviation indicator (CDI) was frozen. The frozen captain's CDI was determined to be a non-deferrable, Aircraft-on-Ground (AOG) item. There was also a deferred maintenance item (DMI) on the number 1 thrust reverser. Due to concerns expressed by the captain of the incoming flight about the operability of the thrust reversers in consideration of icy runway conditions at Anchorage, maintenance also decided to lube, inspect, and check all four thrust reversers for proper operation. One mechanic working on the number 2 thrust reverser asked the mechanic working on the number 1 thrust reverser to finish up the aircraft and close all engine cowls, since he had already worked over three hours overtime.  The mechanic who worked on the number 1 thrust reverser, and who was asked by the first mechanic to close all engine cowls, reported that he lowered the number 1 and 2 cowling doors, but that he and another mechanic were unable to secure and lock the doors. He stated that about 16:00, they returned to the shop for assistance in locking and securing the cowling doors. He stated that at that time, he entered in the turnover log that all four cowling doors required securing, and also verbally reported this to two other mechanics from the next shift.  One of the company mechanics who took the turnover report on the cowl doors from the first-shift mechanic stated that at about 1530, he received a tie-in from that mechanic (the one assigned to the number 1 thrust reverser) that all cowlings on N811CK needed to be closed. He noted that the cowlings for the number 1 and number 2 engines were closed and that those for the number 3 and 4 engines were wide open. He assisted in closing the number 3 engine cowl, but did not check the number 1 or number 2 cowlings to ensure that they were secured.  The captain reported that his first indication of any problems was at rotation, when the number 2 engine N2 (high pressure section) RPM indication went to zero and the number 2 engine generator light came on. He stated he also noticed the aircraft roll left slightly at that time. The captain reported that he and his crew were diagnosing the problem when the control tower called and notified him that his aircraft had left debris on the runway during takeoff. The captain stated that he then called company headquarters in Ypsilanti, Michigan, and decided to return to Seattle-Tacoma International.  The flight engineer reported that the cowlings were closed when he arrived at the aircraft, that he observed no abnormalities during the exterior preflight inspection. The number 1 and 2 engine cowls completely departed the aircraft during the accident sequence. Several cowl sections were found on the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport runway; two cowling sections were also found in a residential area in the Browns Point area of Tacoma, Washington, approximately 10 nautical miles south-southwest of the airport. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""Inadequate inspection of the number 1 and 2 engine cowls by company maintenance personnel and inadequate preflight inspection by the flight engineer, resulting in unsecured cowls separating from the aircraft during takeoff.

On this flight, there would also be the final evaluation of the first officer, with a view to  promotion to captain. The flight took place normally, without any abnormalities until the moment of landing. The weather conditions of the destination were poor with rain, strong wind with gusts and windshear indications in the vicinity of the airport. The aircraft performed the NDB ECHO 2 approach for runway 29. During the landing, the aircraft floated over the runway, touching down approximately 1000 meters past the threshold. After the touchdown, the aircraft ran for about 1400 metres before it suffered a runway excursion and collided with a ditch. The aircraft suffered severe damage. Contributing factors a. Human Factor (1) Physiological Aspect - Did Not Contribute (2) Psychological Aspect - Contributed From the knowledge of the prevailing weather conditions, it was possible for pilots to predict the possibility of ""windshear"" in the aerodrome area. In the meantime, they proceeded to land in compliance with the company's operational standards. b. Material Factor - No contribution c. Operational Factor (1) Adverse Weather Conditions - Contributed Adverse meteorological phenomena, with regard to the tailwind component, cross wind  and heavy rain, substantially interfered with the operation of the aircraft in the landing phase, leading to abnormal circumstances and loss of ground control. (2) Poor Infrastructure - Contributed The meteorological information reported to the aircraft was being obtained from measuring points located in the control tower, and not in the vicinity of the runway.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CENIPA Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Zero Hora   Location  Images: photo (c) FÃ¡bio LuÃ­s Fonseca; Porto Alegre - Salgado Filho; 28 February 2000 photo (c) FÃ¡bio LuÃ­s Fonseca; Porto Alegre - Salgado Filho; 28 February 2000 photo (c) FÃ¡bio LuÃ­s Fonseca; Porto Alegre - Salgado Filho; 28 February 2000 photo (c) Ricardo Chaves/Zero Hora; Porto Alegre - Salgado Filho; 27 February 2000 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

At the same time, the flight engineer was reconfiguring the airplane's electrical system from a Category III landing to a Category I landing.  When the flight engineer closed the ""number one bus-tie-breaker,"" the airplane experienced an uncommanded pitch-up, accompanied by numerous momentary instrument failures.  Twelve occupants were injured.  The airplane was utilizing the ""A"" autopilot system, which remained engaged.  The pilot disconnected the autopilot, leveled the airplane, re-engaged the autopilot, and continued to an uneventful landing.  During a ferry flight, maintenance personnel were able to duplicate a ""sudden pitch-up"" while using the airplane's ""B"" autopilot system, and closing the ""number two bus-tie-breaker."" Additionally, the flight crew reported that the airplane ""felt light in pitch.""  Examination of data obtained from the flight data recorder and optical quick access recorder revealed an electrical discontinuity around the time of the pitch-up. An inspection of the airplane revealed that the number 1 and 2, elevator feel computer pitot connections were capped.  Review of the airplane's maintenance history revealed that the airplane had recently undergone an ""inter 2 check"" at a British Airways maintenance facility.  During that time, maintenance personnel disconnected the pitot connections to the elevator feel computer in order to perform pitot static system checks.  The effect of the disconnected pitot-static lines on the elevator feel computer would have resulted in a more extreme travel of the elevator control surface.  The calculated expected autopilot elevator authority for the accident flight was about 4 degrees.  The estimated actual elevator deflection during the accident sequence was 6.87 degrees nose up, and 6.97 degrees nose down.  Review of the Boeing basic airplane maintenance manual section that detailed the pitot-static system checks revealed a test to confirm that the elevator feel computer was reconnected and functioned.  The test was not present the maintenance manual utilized by British Airways, which was provided by Boeing.  The source of the pitch-up command to the autopilot was not determined; however, when the autopilot system was properly configured, the pitch-up characteristics were not objectionable and within expected values. Probable Cause: Maintenance personnel's failure to reconnect the pitot connections to the elevator feel computer which resulted in an elevator control surface deflection which was outside of the normal autopilot elevator authority.  The uncommanded autopilot input to the elevator control surface resulted from an undetermined electrical source.  A factor in this accident was that the section of the 747 Maintenance Manuel utilized by company maintenance personnel did not contain an ""elevator feel light test.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NYC00LA085 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB NYC00LA085 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates03-May-2024 10:26 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

When still turning onto the main runway the crew already reported ready for takeoff. Flaps were erroneously selected at 11 degrees instead of 20 degrees. At a speed of 165 km/h during takeoff the began to rotate the aircraft. It attained a 13-degree angle of attack and climbed to a height of 8-10 metres when it stalled. The airplane rolled left and struck the ground with a 60-65 degree bank angle and crashed.Sources: MAK Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC)   Location  Images: photo (c) Lukas Lusser; Moskva-Sheremetyevo Airport (SVO); 20 August 1997 photo (c) Miklos Szabo; Budapest-Ferihegy Airport (BUD); 10 June 1999 photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Praha-Ruzyne International Airport (PRG/LKPR); October 1999 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The ILS approach to runway 18 (6,299 x 150 feet, contaminated with ice, and -.611% gradient) at Jackson Hole Airport was performed with a 6.5 knot tailwind.  During the landing roll, the captain used the emergency braking system, which deactivated the anti-skid protection.  At mid-field, the airplane slid left, then slid right, and then left back to the runway centerline where the captain said he continued braking.  The airplane continued beyond the end of the runway for 160 feet into snow approximately 2 feet deep.  The manufacturer's Airplane Flight Manual indicates that when emergency braking is utilized, the anti-skid protection is deactivated.  The CVR recorded a 'high pitch' sound at 0839:44, which was the high-pressure air of the emergency braking system being activated.  The Airplane Flight Manual also limits landing on contaminated runways to the following: A. Winds must be zero or a headwind of less than 30 knots (i.e. no tailwind); B. The runway gradient must be between -1% and  2.2%; and C. The anti-skid system must be operational. Probable Cause: The pilot not following the airplane manufacturer's recommended landing procedures for a contaminated runway by landing with a tailwind.  Factors were the pilot's inadvertent deactivation of the anti-skid protection, the ice contaminated runway, and the snow covered terrain beyond the runway.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DEN00LA057 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DEN00LA057 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates16-Oct-2022 04:17 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

The first segment of the flight from Lagos (LOS) to Abuja (ABV) was flown by the Commander. The aircraft departed Lagos about 06:30 hours UTC and initially at cruise, the crew had a momentary problem setting power on the starboard engine after which the flight continued normally to Abuja.  The aircraft which departed Abuja for Jos (JOS) at 09:00 hours UTC first officer at the controls. At FL 90 and about 30NM from Abuja, the crew again had problems with the cruise power setting on the starboard engine. The torque remained at 1400. The crew retarded the right power lever to the minimum with the aim of achieving a cruise setting of 1300 but the gear warning came on. The Commander at this stage took over the controls from the first officer. At 09:23 hours UTC, the aircraft contacted Kaduna Tower that it would be diverting to Kaduna (KAD) giving its flight level as 90 at a distance of 61 miles and estimating TMA at 24 miles, 'KC' at 41 miles, 6 souls on board and 5 hours endurance at departure. The tower then gave the aircraft an inbound clearance to 'KC' locator maintaining FL 90 and to expect no delay for a locator approach runway 05. Weather report at 09:00 hours UTC was also passed to the aircraft as wind 090/05 knots, QNH 1014 and temperature 30Â°C. At 09:28 hours UTC the airplane at about 42 miles, speed between 150-160 kts, requested descent and was cleared to 4,500ft, QNH 1014. At about 09:35 hours UTC, the pilots contacted tower that they would make a single engine approach because they were having problems controlling power on the starboard engine and it would be shut down.  The commander then reviewed the single engine approach with the first officer estimating 4,500 ft at 8NM. Approaching 4,500 ft at 11 NM, the crew initiated right engine shut down after which the speed was decayed from 150 to 140 kts. At 09:46 hours UTC, the pilot reported 6nm final and field in sight while the tower requested him to report 4 miles final. The controller reported having the aircraft in sight and subsequently cleared it to land on runway 05 giving wind as north easterly 06 knots. Descending at 500ft/min, the commander requested for 25% of flap when the first officer selected full flap. When the aircraft was at 2,700 ft high, the speed had already decayed to between 100 - 110 kts. The crew applied full power on the port engine to arrest the speed decay but to no avail. The pilot was trying to correct the descent rate, speed decay and the asymmetry when the stall warning came on.  The aircraft belly landed and struck the new VOR/DME site being constructed about 1175 m from the threshold of runway 05. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The probable cause of this accident was the poor handling by the crew of the one-engine inoperative approach.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIPB Report number: 04/375 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources: ICAO Adrep File : 00000870   Location  Images: photo (c) AIPB Nigeria; Kaduna Airport (KAD); March 2000 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The ice strip on the lake was 2700 feet approximate in length, 150 feet wide. The aircraft was observed to touch down nearly halfway along the ice strip, the tail of the aircraft remained in the air, and the aircraft took off almost immediately. The main landing gear was seen to retract. The aircraft reached the end of the runway then abruptly entered a steep, nose-up attitude, banked sharply to the left, turned left, and descended into the ice. The left wing made first contact with the ice. The aircraft rotated around the left wing and struck the ice in a steep, nose-down attitude about 400 feet from the end of the ice strip. FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: - The pilot lost control of the aircraft while conducting a go-around from a balked landing on an ice strip. - The aircraft's centre of gravity (C of G) on the accident flight was beyond the aft C of G limit. - The actual C of G of the aircraft at basic operating weight was 16.7 inches aft of the C of G provided in the weight and balance report. - The load sheet index number used by the crew was inaccurate. - The stack of 2x4 lumber was inadequately secured and may have shifted rearward during the go-around. - The crew did not recalculate the aircraft's weight and balance for the second flight. - Leaks in the heater shroud allowed carbon monoxide gas to contaminate cockpit and cabin air. - The captain's carboxyhaemoglobin level was 17.9 per cent, which may have adversely affected his performance, especially his decision making and his visual acuity.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: TSB Report A00C0059 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Both crewmembers said they never saw the tug until after the collision, and when the aircraft door was opened, they realized that the baggage vehicle had collided with their aircraft. The police report showed that the pilot had said in his initial report, that he felt as if the left wing had been pushed hard and he had observed that the aircraft's left propeller and wing, as well as the rear baggage carts were damaged. The police report also showed that the baggage cart had been equipped with no lights, only reflectors, and that the distance from the center of the yellow taxi line to the impact point where the debris lay was about 30 feet. In addition, a ramp control incident report showed that in addition to the debris being located 30 feet from the yellow line, the debris was also located 73 feet from the aircraft containment line. The tug driver stated that he had been driving as close to the fuchsia (red) line as was possible, when the collision occurred. The ramp supervisor who was marshalling the aircraft and witnessed the collision stated that he was 100 feet away, and observed that the tug and cart was coming from the left side of the aircraft, trying to cross the taxiway from one side to the other, and the tug driver did not notice the aircraft taxiing in, and tried to avoid hitting the aircraft by making a turn to the left, but he hit the airplane with the cart, causing damage to the airplane's left wing and propeller.

Prior to starting the approach, the flightcrew determined that the landing approach speed (Vref) and the approach speed (Vapp) were 122 and 128 knots, respectively. The airplane flying on autopilot passed the middle marker at 200 feet AGL at 130 knots on the ILS approach. Approximately 3 seconds after the first officer called ""runway in sight twelve o'clock,"" the captain disconnected the autopilot, while at a radio altitude of 132 feet and on a heading of approximately 18 degrees. Within approximately 11 seconds after the autopilot disconnect, the glideslope and localizer deviation increased. The first officer called ""runway over there.""

The departure and en route portions of the flight to Fox Harbour were unremarkable until preparation for the descent. The owner of the IAI Astra jet had made it clear to this crew, and to other crews on previous occasions, that he expected arrivals and approaches to be flown in minimum time. The operating crew and other employees confirmed this pressure, and aircrew therefore planned and conducted their operations accordingly. In preparation for the arrival and the approach to Fox Harbour, the crew inserted a series of waypoints in the flight management system to guide them for a straight-in approach and landing on runway 33. In general, the descent was flown at high speed on a track following the navigation waypoints programmed in the flight management system by the crew. Speed brakes were required to slow the aircraft during the descent. Example speeds show that the aircraft was at 340 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS) at 10 000 feet, 310 KIAS at 5000 feet, and 250 KIAS at 1000 feet. At 1000 feet, the aircraft was levelled and decelerated to configure for approach and landing. About this time, there was a slight quartering tailwind component, estimated to be about six knots. Because the speed was high throughout the descent, flaps and landing gear selections were delayed and, consequently, not fully extended until about three miles from the runway. At this time, the co-pilot went ""heads down"" to ensure that all checklist items were complete and to confirm that the aircraft was properly configured to land. When he next looked up, he observed that the aircraft was low in relationship to the runway and advised the captain, who corrected by levelling the aircraft. The aircraft altitude was recorded on radar to be between 200 and 300 feet above sea level while tracking inbound to the airport. A short distance before the tree line the aircraft began descending again. The co-pilot saw trees between the aircraft and the runway and called for an overshoot. The captain had begun the overshoot on the co-pilot's call; however, the action was not taken in time to avoid striking the trees. About 50 feet above ground level and 1300 feet from the threshold of runway 33, the aircraft struck the trees and descended 10 feet into the treetops, then climbed away. Damage to the aircraft comprised wing leading-edge dents, minor fuselage perforations, leading- and trailing-edge flap dents and perforations, nose and landing-gear door damage, and foreign object damage to both engines. Tree debris was entangled in the landing gear; some of this debris fell from the aircraft during the overshoot. Debris that entered the engines subsequently resulted in an odour of burning wood and some smoke in the cabin. Once the aircraft began climbing on the overshoot, the crew raised the landing gear and the trailing-edge flaps. Both systems functioned normally. The initial decision to raise the landing gear and the flaps was re-examined during the overshoot climb, resulting in the leading-edge flaps being left extended. The crew contacted air traffic control on the overshoot, declared an emergency, and requested clearance to Charlottetown. Charlottetown was chosen because it was nearby and clearly visible from Fox Harbour, had landing aids, and had airport emergency response services. The aircraft continued to Charlottetown for a straight-in approach and an uneventful landing and shutdown. FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1. Conditions conducive to black-hole illusion were present during the night approach to the runway. 2. In this situation, the crew did not recognize the potential hazard of the black-hole illusion and therefore did not compensate for it. 3. The crew did not adhere to the required standard operating procedures for the preparation and execution of the approach. Consequently, the crew were inadequately prepared for the visual conditions on final approach. FINDINGS AS TO RISK: 1. The high descent and intermediate approach speeds caused cockpit pre-landing checks to be delayed. This delay resulted in the co-pilot's attention being diverted inside the cockpit when approach monitoring should have been done. 2. The crew's decision to raise the landing gear and the flaps on the overshoot after hitting the trees increased the risk to the flight.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A00A0051 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: TSB Report Number A00A0051 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  5 February 2010 C-FRJZ Jetport Inc. 0 In flight near Hamilton, Ontario min Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

It landed in Bangkok-Don Muang International Airport (BKK), Thailand after an uneventful flight. The same flight crew made the return flight back to Colombo after 4 hours and 20 minutes ground time in Bangkok. The crew had received the weather report prior to departure. The aircraft was refueled adding 6681 kg of fuel to the remaining 8300 kg bringing the total fuel onboard to 14981 kg. Flight SCB 702 departed Bangkok. The scheduled flight time for Bangkok - Colombo was five hours and twenty minutes with a scheduled time of arrival of 17:00 hours. SCB 702 made the first radio contact with Sri Lanka air traffic control at 16:16. The area controller passed SCB702 the latest weather report effective for Colombo. At 16:40 the controller radioed: ""There is a sigmet valid up to 1415 UTC, Colombo FIR CBs, Thunderstorms were found having tops up to FL360 over Sri Lanka including Colombo and Ratmalana airfields and now contact Colombo Director on 132.4 Mhz."" When the crew contacted the approach radar controller (Director) they were asked to report the radial and DME from Colombo, (i.e. from ""DVOR/DME KAT""). SCB 702 reported as saying ""074 radial and 55 DME ready for descent"". Later, flight SCB 702 made two unsuccessful ILS approaches to runway 04. While on a radar heading to get established on the ILS to runway 22 for a third attempt to land, all four engines stopped. The propellers were feathered and the aircraft entered a controlled glide. It cut through several coconut trees before crashing on the houses. The left wing had separated first. The right wing then separated as well. Both wings lost all engines in the process.  There had been two isolated minor fires where the main wing tank and the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) were found. Both the fires had not spread to other areas and had extinguished on its own. CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT: The aircraft accident occurred due to fuel starvation. Contributory factors to the accident are as follows. i) Violation of Air Navigation Regulations on fuel planning; ii) Failure of the flight crew to declare an emergency; iii) Being unable to land due to adverse weather situation; iv) Lack of communicability of the flight crew in English language; v) Non-availability of established air traffic control procedures to assist an aircraft in distress; vi) Failure of Skycabs (Pvt.)

No injuries reported to the passengers and crew (exact numbers of passengers and crew not reported).  ""Towards the end of the taxi out to the hold for Runway 9R, which was reported to have been conducted at speeds no higher than 9 knots, the crew heard a loud bang and felt a slight âbumpâ. Almost immediately all of the anti-skid warning lights associated with the right wing landing gear illuminated on the flight deck. About this time a passenger informed the cabin crew that he had seen a tyre roll from under the aircraft across the grass, between the taxiway and the runway.  The aircraft stopped at the holding point and was duly inspected by airport personnel. It was evident that the inboard rim of the No 2 wheel (front inboard wheel of the left wing landing gear) had completely detached from the wheel and this had allowed the tyre to come off. After wheels Nos 1 and 2 had been changed, the aircraft was towed back to the gate where the passengers disembarked normally"" Further examination of the aircraft revealed that fragments of the failed inboard rim had been jettisoned by the released inboard wall of the tyre and caused impact damage to the right main gear door, the right wing landing gear and its folding door. In addition, a wiring conduit which was mounted on the right wing gear drag brace, and contained the anti-skid units wiring, had been severed in two places.

The captain advised the first flight attendant to expect turbulence.  He turned on the fasten seat belt sign, and he directed that cabin service be suspended and the service carts stowed.  The first flight attendant notified the other flight attendants of the captain's instructions.  She stated that she directed them to ""stop service and take their seats immediately.""  The flight attendants secured the cabin, which took a few minutes. However, they had not taken their seats when the airplane encountered several jolts of moderate turbulence.  The airplane's flight data recorder indicated that within a 1/2-second period the vertical acceleration changed from -0.05G to  2.37Gs.  The first flight attendant (front cabin) was knocked off her feet.  The three flight attendants in the aft galley were thrown upward but did not strike the ceiling before coming back down and falling to the floor.  One was seriously injured.  The operator's ""InFlight Operations Manual"" required the flight crew to use standard terminology during briefings to the flight attendants.  The descriptive terms include usage of the words ""light, moderate, or severe"" when describing expected turbulence.  Neither the captain nor any of the flight attendants reported having used/heard these terms regarding the anticipated turbulence intensity.

CAUSE: During a non-scheduled commercial flight, during landing, the aircraft deviated to the left of the runway and one of the blades of the No. 1 propeller impacted a beacon, due to an inadequate sequence in the activation of the engine controls and propeller pitch.Sources: http://www.jiaac.gob.ar/files/pdf/Bol30.pdf  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates23-May-2023 21:28 harro Updated Corrections or additions? ...

Flight 541 departed Manila (MNL) at 05:21 hours and was due to land at Davao (DVO), Philippines, around 06:45.  The aircraft was being flown as a route check for a captain. Another captain was acting as Pilot Monitoring on the flight. The en route part of the flight was uneventful. The aircraft was conducting an ILS approach to runway 05 and the controller reported that they would be behind Philippine Airlines flight 809, an Airbus A319. As the Boeing 737 broke out of clouds, the A319 was observed on runway 05. The Pilot Flying informed ATC of his intention to perform a 360Â° maneuver, but the Pilot Monitoring advised ATC of the opposite, stating that the aircraft would turn right instead of following the missed approach procedure, which called for a left hand turn to a 020Â° heading. The aircraft re-entered clouds and attempted to fly visually at a lower altitude in instrument conditions when in fact it should have climbed to 4000 feet.  The flight continued over Samal Island and the flight requested a VOR/DME approach and landing in the opposite direction (runway 23), which was approved by the controller. After having aligned with the runway heading, the aircraft descended below the normal glide path for this approach. It continued down to 570 feet at a point where the aircraft should have been at 1500 feet. The aircraft crashed into a coconut plantation on a hillside in Barangay San Isidro, disintegrated and caught fire.Sources: AP  ICAO Adrep  Nolan News, Fall 08  Philippine Daily Inquirer  The Philippine STAR   Location  Images: photo (c) Erik Oxtorp, via Werner Fischdick; Manila-Ninoy Aquino International Airport (MNL); June 1999 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates05-Jan-2025 19:52 ASN Updated [Narrative, ]10-Feb-2025 07:40 ASN Updated The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The 3-man cockpit crew, 11-person cabin crew, and 220 passengers were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. An instrument flight rules flight plan had been filed for the flight, between Newark and Brussels Airport (BRU), Belgium.  Startup and taxi were normal, and during the taxi, the captain again briefed the cockpit crew, and included engine failures, as well as ""non-reject"" situations. The airplane lined up on runway 04L, and the captain applied takeoff power slowly and smoothly. At takeoff decision speed (V1), there was a loud explosion. A white ""engine fail"" light illuminated in front of the captain, and the number 1 engine N1 decreased by 30 percent. Number 2 and number 3 engines appeared normal.  The captain continued the takeoff, and the landing gear was raised. A red, left main landing gear warning light illuminated on the front panel. The airplane turned to a heading of 010, and slowly climbed to 3,000 feet. During the climb, an airframe vibration developed.  After level-off, the crew began to troubleshoot the emergency, and found that when the number 3 engine N1 was reduced, the vibration disappeared. Both the number 1 and the number 3 engines remained at reduced power, in relation to number 2, for the rest of the flight.  Air traffic control personnel provided vectors for a return to Newark. During the return, the crew dumped about 90,000 pounds of fuel. The crew also ran both 1-engine, and 2-engine inoperative checklists, and prepared data cards for both scenarios.  The captain flew the ILS glideslope down to a full-stop landing, on runway 04R at 20:16. After stopping on the runway, the brakes would not release, so the crew shut down the engines, and the passengers and crew disembarked through the normal deplaning doors. The airplane was later towed to a ramp.

The certificated airline transport pilot, commercial pilot, and passenger were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and an IFR flight plan was filed for the air response medical flight to New York-La Guardia Airport, NY (LGA). The captain stated that prior to departure the flight controls were tested, with no abnormalities noted, and the takeoff trim was set to the ""middle of the takeoff range,"" without referring to any available pitch trim charts. During the takeoff roll on runway 28, the pilot attempted to rotate the airplane twice, and then aborted the takeoff halfway down the 4,840 foot long runway, because the controls ""didn't feel right."" The airplane traveled off the departure end of the runway and through a fence, and came to rest near a road. The pilot reported no particular malfunction with the airplane. Examination of the airplane revealed that the horizontal stabilizer was positioned at -4.6 degrees, the maximum nose down limit within the takeoff range. The horizontal stabilizer trim and elevator controls were checked, and moved freely through their full ranges of travel. According to the AFM TAKEOFF TRIM C.G. FUNCTION chart, a horizontal stabilizer trim setting of -7.2 was appropriate with the calculated C.G. of 20% MAC. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The pilot's improper trim setting, which resulted in a runway overrun and impact with a fence.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: IAD01LA022 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Following the collision, the airplane continued down the runway with the tires smoking, veered off the right side of the runway near the end, crossed a taxiway, impacted into a ditch and burst into flames. After the accident, the captain and first officer both reported that the thrust reversers failed to operate after they were deployed during the landing. Examination of the landing gear found all three gear collapsed. The right and left main tires had areas of rubber that were worn completely through. The flaps were found extended, and both thrust reversers were found in the stowed position. Examination of the cockpit found the throttles in the idle position, and the thrust reverser levers in the stowed position. Aircraft performance calculations indicate that the airplane traveled 1,500 feet down the runway after touchdown, in 4.2 seconds, before striking the deer. The calculations also indicate that the airplane landed with a ground speed of 124 knots. At 124 knots and maximum braking applied, the airplane should have come to a complete stop in about 850 feet. However, investigation of the accident site and surrounding area revealed heavy black skid marks beginning at the first taxiway turnoff about 1,500 feet down the 5,010 foot runway. The skid marks continued for about 2,500 feet, departed the right side of the runway and proceeded an additional 500 feet over grass and dirt. The investigation revealed that deer fur was found lodged in the squat switch on the left main landing gear, likely rendering the squat switch inoperative after the impact with the deer, and prior to the airplaneÂs loss of control on the runway. Since a valid signal from the squat switch is required for thrust reverser deployment, the loss of this signal forced the thrust reversers to stow. At this point, the electronic engine control (EEC) likely switched to the forward thrust schedule and engine power increased to near takeoff power, which led to the airplane to continue down the runway, and off of it.

The flight crew was cleared by 'Iceman' to taxi out of the de-icing bay via taxiway Tango and hold short of Mike. As the captain applied thrust to manoeuver the aircraft forward, the right wing of the B747 struck de-icing truck number thirteen tipping it over and injuring the driver, who was the sole occupant of the vehicle. The driver was taken to hospital with serious but non-life threatening injuries.  Findings as to causes and contributing factors 1. By passing the de-icing strip, the zone de-icing controller (ZDC) indicated to Iceman that the de-icing procedure was complete. In fact, beta truck 13 was still in position ahead of the aircraft's right wing. 2. On receipt of the de-icing strip, Iceman concluded that the de-icing equipment was clear and issued movement instructions to the flight crew of the aircraft while beta truck 13 was still in position ahead of the aircraft's right wing. 3. One ZDC was monitoring four active de-icing pads instead of the usual three pads. This increased activity resulted in task saturation and frequency congestion for the ZDC. 4. Because of the increased activity and the radio congestion, the driver/operator of beta truck 13 was unable to effectively establish radio communication with the ZDC to advise that he was still in position in front of the aircraft.

Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the pilotÂs spatial disorientation resulting from his failure to maintain positive manual control of the airplane with the available flight instrumentation.

JAL Flight 958, a DC-10-40 was en route from Pusan (PUS) to Tokyo-Narita (NRT). A trainee controller cleared flight 907 to climb to Flight Lever 390 at 15:46. Two minutes later JL958 reported at FL370. Both flights were on an intersecting course near the Yaizu NDB. At 15:54 the controller noticed this, but instead of ordering flight 958 to descend, he ordered the Boeing 747 to descend: ""Japan air niner zero seven, descend and maintain flight level three five zero, begin descent due to traffic."" Immediately after this instruction, the crew of flight 907 were given an aural TCAS Resolution Advisory to climb in order to avoid a collision. At the same time the crew of flight 958 were given an aural TCAS Resolution Advisory to descend. The captain of flight 907 followed the instructions of the air traffic controller by descending. The 747 now approaching close to Flight 958, because the DC-10 captain descended as well, following the advisory of his TCAS. A collision was averted when the pilot of flight 907 then put his Boeing 747 into a nosedive. The 747 missed the DC-10 by 105 to 165 meters in lateral distance and 20 to 60 meters in altitude difference. About 100 crew and passengers on flight 907 sustained injuries due to emergency manoevre, while no one was injured on Flight 958. Flight 958 continued to Narita, while flight 907 returned to Haneda Airport. PROBABLE CAUSE: The Aircraft and Railway Accident Investigation Commission concluded that air traffic control's error in giving the wrong flight numbers when asking the pilots to change course and the pilots' decision to follow air traffic control instead of the computerized Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) were two of the main causes.

JAL Flight 958, a DC-10-40 was en route from Pusan (PUS) to Tokyo-Narita (NRT). A trainee controller cleared flight 907 to climb to Flight Lever 390 at 15:46. Two minutes later JL958 reported at FL370. Both flights were on an intersecting course near the Yaizu NDB. At 15:54 the controller noticed this, but instead of ordering flight 958 to descend, he ordered the Boeing 747 to descend: ""Japan air niner zero seven, descend and maintain flight level three five zero, begin descent due to traffic."" Immediately after this instruction, the crew of flight 907 were given an aural TCAS Resolution Advisory to climb in order to avoid a collision. At the same time the crew of flight 958 were given an aural TCAS Resolution Advisory to descend. The captain of flight 907 followed the instructions of the air traffic controller by descending. The 747 now approaching close to Flight 958, because the DC-10 captain descended as well, following the advisory of his TCAS. A collision was averted when the pilot of flight 907 then put his Boeing 747 into a nosedive. The 747 missed the DC-10 by 105 to 165 meters in lateral distance and 20 to 60 meters in altitude difference. About 100 crew and passengers on flight 907 sustained injuries due to emergency manoevre, while no one was injured on Flight 958. Flight 958 continued to Narita, while flight 907 returned to Haneda Airport. PROBABLE CAUSE: The Aircraft and Railway Accident Investigation Commission concluded that air traffic control's error in giving the wrong flight numbers when asking the pilots to change course and the pilots' decision to follow air traffic control instead of the computerized Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) were two of the main causes. The commission recommended a.o. that the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) put priority on computer orders over instructions from controllers to prevent similar incidents.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JTSB Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Aircraft and Railway Accident Investigation Commission (ARAIC) final report number 02-5; Kyodo Images: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates26-Jul-2012 07:21 harro Added 27-Feb-2015 11:37 harro Updated [Narrative, Photo, ]27-Feb-2015 11:37 harro Updated [Photo, ]27-Jan-2021 18:21 harro Updated [Accident report, ]27-Jan-2021 18:21 harro Updated [Accident report, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The cargo consisted of a.o. 14 barrels with 55 gallons of gasoline each. The aircraft departed El Yopal at 13:45. While attempting to land at MitÃº, the landing gear struck the ground short of the threshold of runway 01. The crew carried out a go around and assessed the situation. The left hand main gear was broken away and a hydraulic leak caused control problems. By switching from the yellow to the blue hydraulic system, the crew were able to regain control. After flying over the control tower at MitÃº, they were informed by the controller of the loss of the left main left gear. The flight crew then declared an emergency and informed the tower controller at MitÃº that they would proceed to BogotÃ¡. The crew was not able to fully raise the flaps, so a decision was made to divert to El Yopal/ The plane climbed to 10000 feet and proceeded to El Yopal at this altitude. The crew then observed that the left engine oil pressure was dropping and the pilot proceeded to shut down the engine. In these conditions the plane began to lose height and speed. They then established contact with the control tower of El Yopal, informing the them of the emergency. It was decided to perform another flyby of the tower, which confirmed the left main hear had separated. The crew then agreed to burn fuel from the left wing tank to avoid a fire on that side during the emergency landing. The fuel indicators showed unreliable values and calculations were difficult since last part of the flight was performed under irregular circumstances. It was then decided to select the left fuel tank and continue to burn fuel until the low fuel warning appeared. The co-pilot recommended the captain to try to restart the left engine to have both reversers available on landing, but the request was rejected. Flying to the South-West of El Yopal Airport, the pilot ordered the co-pilot to move further away from the runway, while taking his cell phone to communicate with the Director of Operations of the airline. When the low fuel alarm went off, they selected the right tank, and the captain decided to return to land.  During the approach the right engine began to fail. The plane lost height quickly until it impacted the ground 4.9 miles from the threshold of runway 05. The aircraft caught fire after the impact and was completely destroyed. PROBABLE CAUSE FIRST IMPACT OF THE AIRCRAFT IN MITU. Low situational alert by the pilot in command in the final approach phase to land. SECOND IMPACT OF THE AIRCRAFT ON THE YOPAL. Failure of the crew to adequately plan for the foreseeable emergency. CONTRIBUTING FACTOR Passive attitude of the crew, especially by the Commander of the aircraft in handling critical situations. Inappropriate handling of CRM, poor or inadequate communication in the cockpit. Little experience in flight hours as a commander by the pilot in command of the aircraft. Little experience inz total flight hours and in the equipment on the part of the co-pilot.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Aerocivil Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: El Tiempo  ICAO Adrep   Location  Images: photo (c) Alex Waning; Villavicencio-La Vanguardia Airport (VVC); 06 May 2000 photo (c) via Andy Herzog; BogotÃ¡-Eldorado Airport (BOG/SKBO); January 1997 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The fuel tank stringers and the wing ribs sustained structural damage.  The PIC stated that the fuel tanks had been repaired and pressure tested prior to the flight.  The PIC added that after the pressure test, the mechanic, who repaired the fuel tank, removed the tape from the right wing's fuel vent; however, both the mechanic and the flight crew failed to notice the duct tape over the left wing's fuel vent.  The flight crew stated that there were no streamers or markers present to indicate that the fuel tank vent was covered with duct tape.

The aircraft was cleared for the ILS/DME procedure for runway 28 and the crew requested the QFE which was 980 hPa. The decision height for the approach was 400 feet. At 1918:11 the crew reported that they were established on the localizer. When the aircraft intercepted the glidepath, the flaps were set to 15Â° correctly configuring the aircraft for the approach. The handling pilot recalled that initially the rate of descent was slightly higher than the expected 650 ft/min leading him to suspect the presence of a tailwind, however, the rate of descent returned to a more normal value when approximately 4 nm from the runway. The propellers were set to the maximum rpm at 1,200 feet agl. When the crew reported that they were inside 4 nm they were cleared to land and passed the surface wind, which was variable at 2 kt; they were also warned that the runway surface was wet. Both pilots saw the runway lights when approaching 400 feet agl; the flaps were selected to 30Â° and confirmed at that position. Both pilots believed that the airspeed was satisfactory but, as the commander checked back on the control column for the landing, the rate of descent increased noticeably and the aircraft landed firmly. Both pilots believed that the power levers were in the flight idle position and neither was aware of any unusual control inputs during the landing flare. The aircraft bounced before hitting the ground again, this time with the nose wheel first, before bouncing once more. The aircraft was then seen to travel about half way along the runway before slewing to the left and running onto the grass. When the aircraft stopped the left wing tip appeared to be touching the grass. CONCLUSION: ""Evidence from the CVR indicated that the flight was conducted in a thoroughly professional manner in accordance the operator's normal procedures until the final stages of the approach. The recorded data indicate that three seconds prior to touchdown the propeller blade angle changed from the flight range to the ground range. Coincident with this change the CVR recorded sounds consistent with the propellers 'disking' and the FDR indicated that the aircraft then decelerated longitudinally and accelerated downwards. The engineering investigation revealed that the propeller control rigging and the operation of the flight idle baulk were correct. Selection of ground fine requires the pilot to firstly release the flight idle baulk and then lift and pull the propeller levers further back, this combined action rapidly becomes a programmed motor skill in the routine of daily operations. It is therefore possible that the handling pilot unintentionally selected the propellers into the ground fine position whilst still in the air.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: AAIB Bulletin 10/2001 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Aviation Letter 417  Flight International 24-30 July 2001   Location  Images: photo (c) Steve Smith; Sheffield City Airport (SZD); 05 February 2001 photo (c) Steve Smith; Sheffield City Airport (SZD); 05 February 2001 photo (c) Joachim Bongers, via Werner Fischdick; Dublin Airport (DUB); September 2000 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

CVR information indicated that the final approach was unstabilized and required airplane configuration changes and maneuvering at a low altitude. Postaccident runway evidence (tire tracks on the snow-covered runway) indicated that the Falcon's right main landing gear touched down left of the runway centerline. The airport manager reported that light snow covered the runway and that there was no evidence of skidding. Probable Cause: **This report was modified on 2/18/2016.

The airplane pushed forward against the tow bar, sheared a pin, bent the tow bar, and struck the tug.  Before engine start, maintenance personnel had conducted an automated check which included automatic movements of the control wheel and throttles. The flight crew returned to their seats while the test was being conducted.   At the completion of the test, the airplane was returned to service and maintenance personnel departed the cockpit.  The captain initiated the BEFORE STARTING ENGINES checklist without either pilot first completing a cockpit flow setup as required by company procedures.  The checklist was then interrupted by a cockpit visitor and a non-pertinent conversation took place for 3 1/2 minutes. When the checklist was resumed, several items had been missed.  As the checklist was continued, the call out THRUST LEVERS was made by the first officer, and the correct response of CLOSED was given by the captain.  Push back was initiated, and the captain verbalized starting the first engine as required by the checklist.  As the first engine was being started, the captain initiated another non-pertinent conversation with the first officer.  The second engine was then started without verbalization as required by company checklist procedures.  Although company checklist procedures made both pilots responsible for ensuring a normal start, neither pilot detected that the engines were accelerating above normal idle.  According to follow-up testing, the engines accelerated to a power setting that corresponded to the last position of the throttles at the completion of the automated test by maintenance. Probable Cause: the failure of the flight crew to follow the checklist prior to engine start, and their subsequent diverted attention during engine start.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NYC01LA077 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB NYC01LA077  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates05-Apr-2024 12:45 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

During their final ILS approach, the aircraft encountered heavy turbulence at about 200 feet agl. with gusts up to 65 mph. The aircraft encountered windshear with 1.25G updraft, downdraft and a tailwind gust at just 70 feet agl. When the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) sounded, the captain called for a go-around while pulling on the sidestick, reportedly without pressing his priority control button. The combination of dynamic winds and the crew actions created a situation that triggered the airplane's alpha protection system. As the crew applied TOGA power for a go-around, with both pilots pulling back on their sidesticks, the alpha protection law reduced the elevator nose-up command. Instead of a go- around, the aircraft struck the runway with a vertical speed of approx. 1,200 fpm. The nosegear collapsed and the aircraft skidded 3,280 feet (about 1000 m) down the runway before coming to a stop. CAUSES: ""The cause of the accident was the activation of the angle of attack protection system which, under a particular combination of vertical gusts and windshear and the simultaneous actions of both crew members on the sidesticks, not considered in the design, prevented the aeroplane from pitching up and flaring during the landing.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIA Report number: A-006/2001 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 years and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   Air Safety Week, Vol. 15, No. 25   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane, with two pilots and the chief technician of the operator on board, took off from runway 10 at 15:31. After five nautical miles the aircraft turned to the south. Less than three minutes after departure at an altitude of 5900 feet and an airspeed of 250 knots, the no. 1 engine failed. The captain decided to return to the airfield. Preparing for the approach to runway 10, the flaps were set at 8 degrees and the landing gear was extended. Because the aircraft was above the glideslope, power was reduced to idle and the flaps were lowered to 20 and a little later further down to 40 degrees. At that moment the airspeed dropped considerably. The thrust lever of the remaining right hand engine was then advanced to near takeoff power. Due to the asymmetric thrust the plane yawed to the left at a height of 200-300 feet. The captain ordered the first officer to raise the flaps back to the 20 degree position. The Learjet then stalled to the left, rolled inverted and crashed into trees. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The accident was caused by an in-flight failure of the left power plant appr. 3 minutes after take-off and an inadequate conduct of the subsequent single-engine land procedure so that in short final the airplane stalled and crashed from low height. The failure of the left engine was caused by intergranular fractures of retention posts on the high pressure turbine disk.

Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The flight was operating under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 121 as Great Lakes Flight 6798 and was on an active instrument flight plan. The captain and first officer (FO) reported no injuries. Eight passengers were released from the accident scene without treatment and seven passengers were transported to local area hospitals for evaluation and treatment of minor injuries. The flight originated at the Capital Airport, Springfield, Illinois at 1605. The crew unintentionally landed the airplane with the landing gear in the fully retracted position.  The crew did not lower the landing gear or check the landing gear position as required on the flaps-up landing checklist, the normal landing checklist, and final checklist.  According to the cockpit voice recorder (CVR), the landing gear unsafe warning horn did not sound during the entire recorded portion of the accident flight.  The minimum equipment list (MEL) requires the installation of a placard that prohibits the silencing of the landing gear warning horn when the flap system is inoperative.  The accident airplane had a placard that stated, ""Do not silence gear warning horn.""  No anomalies were found with the landing gear system including the landing gear unsafe warning horn, the red landing gear control handle lighting, and the landing gear position lights.  The flap system and ground proximity warning system (GPWS) were inoperative for the accident flight and were listed on the MEL as items that could be inoperative for revenue flight. Probable Cause: The flightcrew not lowering the landing gear and/or verifying the landing gear position as required by three separate checklists, which resulted in an inadvertent gear-up landing.  A factor to the accident was the flightcrew not complying with the required minimum equipment list placard that prohibited the silencing of the landing gear warning horn.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CHI01FA084 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  https://cdn.jetphotos.com/full/2/20473_1117105928.jpg (photo) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

The captain had the autopilot engaged as the airplane descended through 10,000 feet mean sea level.  The nose pitched down violently about 10 degrees, and then the nose pitched back up.  The captain disengaged the autopilot and hand flew the airplane to touchdown.  The Brasilia has two elevator trim actuators.  The manufacturer discovered moisture and corrosion in some of the actuators submitted for repair after similar occurrences.  They suspected that leaking seals allowed moisture into the actuators, which froze at altitude.  In numerous instances, the actuators functioned properly after descent to lower altitudes and warmer temperatures, where the units thawed.  One unit was dirty, corroded, and had overspray on it.  It leaked from the shaft seals and autoloc seal.  It failed the non-jamming stop test.  It's two shaft housings contained moisture.  The chain and pins were corroded, the packing had deteriorated, and the springs were weak.  One side of the rollers was not chamfered, and staking warped some screws.  The hub was worn and not functioning properly.  The second unit was dirty and had overspray on it.  The actuator leaked from the shaft seals.  The actuator had excessive backlash and failed the tangential free play test.  It's two shaft housings contained moisture.  The chain, pins, shafts, and housings were corroded.  The packing had deteriorated, and the bearings were rough and binding.  The rollers only had one chamfered side.  The shim was not with the unit.

After preparation for a Royal Mail charter flight 670A to Belfast, start clearance was given at 15:03. At 15:12Â hrs the crew advised ATC they were shutting down due to a technical problem. The crew then advised their company that a generator would not come on line. An avionics technician carried out diagnosis during which both engines were ground-run twice. No fault was found and the flight crew requested taxi clearance at 17:10. A normal take off from runway 06 was carried out followed by a reduction to climb power at 1,200 feet amsl. At 2,200 feet amsl the aircraft anti-icing systems were selected on. Three seconds later the torque on each engine reduced rapidly to zero. A MAYDAY call was made by the crew advising that they had experienced a double engine failure. The aircraft was ditched in the Firth of Forth estuary some 100 meters from the shoreline near Granton Harbour.  Weather reported just before the accident with a temperature of +2Â°C, dewpoint of -3Â°C, visibility of more then 10 km, broken clouds at 4500 feet and cover at 8000 feet. CAUSAL FACTORS: 1) The operator did not have an established practical procedure for flight crews to fit engine intake blanks (ÂbungsÂ) in adverse weather conditions. This meant that the advice contained in the aircraft manufacturerÂs Maintenance Manual ÂFreezing weather-precautionsÂ was not complied with. Furthermore intake blanks were not provided on the aircraft nor were any readily available at Edinburgh Airport. 2) A significant amount of snow almost certainly entered into the engine air intakes as a result of the aircraft being parked heading directly into strong surface winds during conditions of light to moderate snowfall overnight. 3) The flow characteristics of the engine intake system most probably allowed large volumes of snow, ice or slush to accumulate in areas where it would not have been readily visible to the crew during a normal pre-flight inspection. 4) At some stage, probably after engine ground running began, the deposits of snow, ice or slush almost certainly migrated from the plenum chambers down to the region of the intake anti-ice vanes. Conditions in the intakes prior to takeoff are considered to have caused re-freezing of the contaminant, allowing a significant proportion to remain in a state which precluded its ingestion into the engines during taxi, takeoff and initial climb. 5) Movement of the intake anti-icing vanes, acting in conjunction with the presence of snow, ice or slush in the intake systems, altered the engine intake air flow conditions and resulted in the near simultaneous flameout of both engines. 6) The standard operating procedure of selecting both intake anti-ice vane switches simultaneously, rather than sequentially with a time interval, eliminated a valuable means of protection against a simultaneous double engine flameout.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: AAIB AAR 2/03 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) AAIB; near Granton Harbour; February 2001 photo (c) AAIB; near Granton Harbour; 28 February 2001 photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Glasgow International Airport (GLA); August 1999 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All of the passengers were members of a Virginia-based military construction and engineering crew on a routine training mission. The plane's pilot and two other crew members were members of the 171st Aviation Regiment of the Florida Army National Guard It appeared that the pilot's decision to go to the bathroom shifted the weight of the already unbalanced plane and caused it to become unstable and uncontrollable while in an area of strong turbulence. The nose of the plane slowly pitched up and then abruptly dropped just before the crash. In three seconds, the plane rose more than 100 feet with its nose down, and was then rocked by wind shear three times greater than what is defined as extreme turbulence. Within the first 12 seconds that they encountered problems, the G-force shifts rendered the crew and passengers incapacitated and unconscious and caused the breakup of the aircraft in flight. It was also established that the weather radar was underpowered, negatively impacting the ability of the crew to successfully circumnavigate around the severe weather. This C-23B Sherpa was originally built as a Shorts 360 (SH-3684) in December 1985 and was delivered to Simmons Airlines as N374MQ In 1998 the aircraft was converted to a Sherpa C-23B+. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The Collateral Investigation Board found the preponderance of the evidence concluded that the aircraft accident was due to crew error. The board found other factors present but not contributing directly to this aircraft accident. These factors may have influenced the crew's decision making process and aircraft performance. This is normally the case in most aircraft human factor accidents. The board did find the preponderance of the evidence directed the board toward the crew's failure to properly load the aircraft. In particular, the crew's failure to properly manage the weight and balance of the aircraft resulted in an 'out-of-CG' condition that exceeded the aircraft design limits, rendering the aircraft unstable and leading to a violent departure from controlled flight. Once the aircraft departed controlled flight, the rapid onset of significant G-force shifts rendered the crew and passengers incapacitated and unconscious and led to a structural break-up of the aircraft in flight. This ultimately resulted in the aircraft impacting the ground, killing all on board.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: USAF AIB Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Pete Whybrow  St. Petersburg Times   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

An engine examination and teardown determined that the #5 bearing assembly had failed.  Additional examination ascertained that the P2.5/P3 switching valve to rear inlet case sealing air tube had become disconnected, and the NL probe port sealing tube had melted, allowing an oil fed fire outside of the engine casing and into the engine compartment.  Investigation determined that the engine had not been placed on oil consumption and daily chip detector examination by company maintenance as required by the engine maintenance manual following a loss of oil event approximately 180 hours previous to the fire.  Additionally, the mandatory implementation of P&W service bulletin 20914, which addressed the P2.5/P3 switching valve to rear inlet case sealing air tube and NL probe port sealing tube was not carried out by the company, nor was it required, as the FAA airworthiness directive making the service bulletin mandatory did not include the PW120A engine.  The investigation also revealed that the company mandated implementation of P&W service bulletin 21446R3, was not carried out during an earlier hot section inspection and immediately preceding the earlier oil loss event. Probable Cause: The failure of the number 5 engine bearing assembly followed by the disconnection of the P2.5/P3 switching valve to rear inlet case sealing air tube and the melting of the NL probe port (sealing tube) which allowed an oil fed fire beyond the constraints of the engine casing and into the engine nacelle.  A contributing factor was the company's failure to follow several maintenance procedures within the maintenance manual after a previous oil loss event.  A second factor was the omission of the PW120A engine from the airworthiness directive issued by the FAA which mandated the completion of Pratt & Whitney service bulletin 20914.  The lack of inclusion of the PW120A engine in the AD resulted in the company's correct interpretation that the service bulletin was not mandatory.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: SEA01FA059 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB SEA01FA059  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates05-Apr-2024 11:45 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

The ILS Runway 06 approach was in use.  Braking action advisories were in effect, and all surfaces were covered with thin wet snow.  During the approach to the airport, with the Second-in-Command (SIC) at the controls, the PIC visually observed that the hydraulic pressure gauge, ""smiley face,"" was normal, and he performed a ""brake test.""  The tower controller advised the flightcrew that a Navajo had just landed and reported a 250-foot ceiling, 3/4 miles of visibility, and that the runway braking action was ""good.""  On final approach, the airplane broke out of the overcast clouds about 400 feet above the ground.  The runway appeared dry, with only blowing snow across it.  As the airplane touched down about 1,463 feet beyond the approach end of the 4,677-foot long runway on the runway, the SIC stated that she did not have any braking effectiveness, and selected the ""dump flaps"" to slow the airplane.  The airplane continued down the runway and did not seem to be slowing to a safe speed.  The flightcrew observed the 1,000-foot marker approaching and the SIC selected the emergency brakes.  After she felt a lack of deceleration, the SIC selected the parking brake.  The airplane continued off the end of the runway, impacted a non-frangible fence, and came to rest with about 4 feet of the airplane protruding onto a public access road.  Examination of the airplane revealed a reference speed set on the pilot's airspeed indicator of 117 knots.  According to the Hawker Siddeley HS-125 Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) performance section, the uncorrected landing distance, on a dry runway, at the estimated landing weight of the airplane was approximately 2,610 feet.  The AFM performance section also had a chart for the ""Effect of Slippery Runway on Landing Distance.""  The chart determined that the ""equivalent scheduled landing distance available,"" was approximately 2,150 feet.  According to airport records, a NOTAM was issued the day of the accident, which referenced the condition of the runway surfaces as having ""Thin wet snow all surfaces.""  An air traffic controller observed slush ""spraying"" from the airplane, which extended 5 feet from the airplane, as the airplane rolled out.  The airplane's braking system was tested after the accident and no abnormalities were noted. Probable Cause: The pilot-in-commands inadequate preflight planning resulting in an approach to a runway with insufficient length.  A factor related to  the accident was the slush covered runway which resulted in a hydroplaning condition.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NYC01FA084 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB NYC01FA084  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates05-Apr-2024 11:39 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

The flight crew reported that at an airspeed of approximately 110 knots, the nose of the airplane began to lift off. The captain attempted to lower the nose, however, the airplane was unresponsive. The airplane became airborne and climbed to an altitude of 20 to 30 feet above the runway. The captain reduced the power on both engines and the airplane settled to the runway, striking the tail. The airplane traveled approximately 700 feet off the end of the runway where it came to rest in the muddy terrain. An emergency evacuation was performed during which the L2 evacuation slide did not deploy. During the investigation, NTSB determined that the airplane was loaded so that its center of gravity (CG), although within limits, was in the aft region of the permissible range. Further, the flight crew had incorrectly set the trim for the trimmable horizontal stabilizer (THS) at -1.7Â°UP (airplane nose up). This setting resulted in a pitch-up trim condition. The proper trim setting, 1.7Â°DN (airplane nose down), would have resulted in a correct trim condition for the way the airplane was loaded. The improperly set trim caused the nose of the airplane to lift off the runway prematurely. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The pilot induced oscillations and the delay in aborting the takeoff. Factors associated with the accident were the first officer used an improper trim setting and the captain did not identify and correct the setting during the taxi checklist, and the wet runway conditions.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CHI01FA104 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB id CHI01FA104   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane was being controlled by the autopilot at about 18,000 feet when they encountered instrument meteorological conditions that rapidly led to the windscreen being covered by a layer of ice. The crew turned ice protection systems on and the ice on the windshield was cleared. The first officer observed ice on the right wing's boots and the right prop's spinner that extended farther back than he had previously experienced. The first officer then switched the ice protection systems to their highest settings. De airspeed then decreased from 1750 to 160 kts. The captain disconnected the autopilot, applied power, and initiated nose down pitch inputs to arrest the airspeed loss. They indicated that these actions were unsuccessful and the speed further deteriorated to about 130 knots at which point the airplane rolled about 90 degrees to the left, and then back to near level. In the next 24 seconds, the airplane again rolled about 110 degrees to the left, back to level, then about 120 degrees to the right, back to level, and then rolled 360 degrees to the right, back to near wings level. Since the crew reported trouble with the flight attitude instruments, the roll angles recorded on the FDR are being further investigated. The maximum nose down pitch attitude was 60 degrees, the maximum recorded airspeed was about 240 kias, and maximum vertical acceleration during recovery was about +3.6 g.

While on finals over the 'Col de la Tourmente', the aircraft was seen making a sharp turn to the left. The Twin Otter struck a house on the 'Col de la Tourmente' and caught fire. A man on the ground was also killed and his wife was injured. While on finals the captain probably  selected ""beta reverse range"" on the propellers in order to slow down. Upon vigorously pushing back the power levers to their normal position, an asymmetric power condition developed. The Twin Otter rolled to the left and crashed. Saint-BarthÃ©lÃ©my is known for the difficult approach to the airport and pilots flying into Saint-BarthÃ©lÃ©my need to have a special certification. After overflying 'Col de la Tourmente' a quick steep descent has to be made to land at runway 10, a 2100 feet runway which ends up in sea. The aircraft overfly the 'Col de la Tourmente' at a height of 10 m or less. PROBABLE CAUSES: ""The accident appears to result from the Captain's use of the propellers in the reverse beta range, to improve control of his track on short final. A strong thrust asymmetry at the moment when coming out of the reverse beta range would have caused the loss of yaw control, then roll control of the aircraft. The investigation could not exclude three other hypotheses which can nevertheless be classified as quite unlikely: - A loss of control during a go-around. - A loss of control due to a stall. - A loss of control due to sudden incapacitation of one of the pilots. The Captain's lack of recent experience on this airplane type, the undeniable difficulty of conducting an approach to runway 10 at Saint-BarthÃ©lemy and the pressure of time during this flight were contributory factors. The low height at which the loss of control occurred was an aggravating factor.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Report number: BEA F-ES010324 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   AP  BEA (Bureau Enquetes-Accidents)  Reuters   Location  Images: photo (c) Philippe MolÃ©; Saint-BarthÃ©lÃ©my Airport, Guadeloupe (SBH); March 2001 photo (c) Philippe MolÃ©; Saint-BarthÃ©lÃ©my Airport, Guadeloupe (SBH) photo (c) Philippe MolÃ©; Saint-BarthÃ©lÃ©my Airport, Guadeloupe (SBH) photo (c) Philippe MolÃ©; Saint-BarthÃ©lÃ©my Airport, Guadeloupe (SBH) photo (c) Philippe MolÃ©; Saint-BarthÃ©lÃ©my Airport, Guadeloupe (SBH) photo (c) Philippe MolÃ©; Saint-BarthÃ©lÃ©my Airport, Guadeloupe (SBH) photo (c) Philippe MolÃ©; Saint-BarthÃ©lÃ©my Airport, Guadeloupe (SBH) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

At 05:45, the aircraft departed Halifax for St. John's. The pilot flying was completing his line indoctrination training after having recently upgraded to captain. En route the crew were advised of a NOTAM that the ILS for runway 11 was unserviceable. Because of the marginal weather, the loss of runway 11/29, and his greater experience, the training captain decided to switch seats and assume the duties and full responsibilities as captain and pilot flying. Clearance for an ILS approach to runway 16 was obtained from Gander ACC, and the crew was advised to contact St. John's tower. Just over two minutes before landing, the tower advised that the wind was 050Â° (estimated) at 20, gusting to 35, knots. The aircraft crossed the final approach fix on the ILS glideslope at 150 KIAS. During the final approach, the airspeed steadily increased to 180 KIAS (ground speed 190 knots); the glidepath was maintained with a descent rate of 1000 feet per minute. From 1000 feet above sea level, no airspeed calls were made; altitude calls were made and responses were made. The Royal Boeing 737 operations manual states that the PNF shall call out significant deviations from programmed airspeed. In the descent, through 900 feet above sea level, the aircraft encountered turbulence resulting in uncommanded roll and pitch deviations and airspeed fluctuations of Â±11 knots. At about 300 feet above decision height, the crew acquired visual references for landing. They were cleared to land. The aircraft touched down at 164 KIAS (27 KIAS above the desired touchdown speed of Vref), 2300 to 2500 feet beyond the threshold. The wind at this point was determined to be about 050Â° at 30 knots. Shortly after touchdown, the speed brakes and thrust reversers were deployed. With approximately 1100 feet of runway remaining, through a speed of 64 KIAS, reverse thrust increased to about 1.97 EPR on engine 1 and 2.15 EPR on engine 2. As the aircraft approached the end of the runway, the captain attempted to steer the aircraft to the right, toward the Delta taxiway intersection. Twenty-two seconds after touchdown, the aircraft exited the departure end of the runway into deep snow. The aircraft came to rest approximately 75 feet beyond and 53 feet to the right of the runway centreline. The 737 has been stored at Saint John's since the accident. The aircraft sustained serious damage to the landing gear and the left engine detached from the wing. Royal Airlines was acquired by Canada 3000 later that year. The 737 has been stored at Saint John's since the accident. Royal Airlines was acquired by Canada 3000 later that year. Canada 3000 went bankrupt late 2001.

The flight was an uneventful transit until the landing. The aerodrome was clearly visible and the commander made a visual approach in accordance to the aerodrome STAR charts. The approach was stabilized, despite the aircraft encountering a windshear at GELO. At 30 feet RA the commander noticed that the aircraft had developed a high sink rate and he attempted to decrease the rate of descent with full aft side stick but the aircraft landed heavily and bounced. At the second touch down the aircraft tail contacted the runway. The aircraft had suffered tail structural damage. There were no personal injuries Causes The investigation concluded that the marked backing of the wind, probably due to turbulence from the adjacent high ground, had caused the loss of headwind component. The application of full aft side stick had reduced the vertical speed of the initial touch down. In an attempt to cushion the second touch down by maintaining a degree of aft side stick during the bounce, the aircraft had continued to pitch up beyond the aircraft geometry limit causing the tail section to contact the runway.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: GPIAA Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 years and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: ICAO Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates18-Sep-2024 18:53 ASN Added 18-Sep-2024 19:24 ASN Updated [Aircraft type, Operator, Location, Nature, Departure airport, Destination airport, Narrative, Accident report, ]18-Sep-2024 19:25 ASN Updated [Location, Destination airport, ] Corrections or additions? ...

Kennedy International Airport, NY (JFK/KJFK)","Las Vegas-McCarran  International Airport, NV (LAS/KLAS)"," NTSB","Accident investigation report completed and information captured","One flight attendant in the aft galley was seriously injured and four others aboard the air carrier flight received minor injuries when the airplane encountered moderate to severe clear air turbulence in cruise at flight level 310 (FL310, 31,000 feet).  About 30 minutes before the turbulence was encountered, the company flight dispatcher communicated to the flight crew that the flight was approaching an area of forecast moderate to severe turbulence associated with mountain wave activity between FL310 and FL390 (39,000 feet).  The dispatcher recommended that the flight alter course and descend to FL280 (28,000 feet).  Eighteen minutes before the turbulence was encountered the pilot requested a ""ride report"" at FL310 from air traffic control and was told to expect ""occasional light chop, nothing real bad.""  The pilot remained at FL310 and remained on the existing routing.  Approaching the area of forecast turbulence, he illuminated the seat belt sign and advised the passengers of the potential for turbulence.  He also advised the flight attendants to stow the galley equipment.  Approximately 3 to 4 minutes later, the flight encountered turbulence.  The injured flight attendant was one of two in the aft galley.  The other flight attendant reported that when the turbulence started they were ""jolted"" a couple of times during which she recalled her feet came off the floor and then the turbulence subsided.  They ""scrambled"" toward their jumpseats; however, they encountered additional, more severe, turbulence and it became impossible to hold onto anything.  She recalled being thrown about the galley; hitting the ceiling, counters, and doors before being ""slammed"" to the floor.  When the turbulence ceased, the flight descended to flight level 280 and continued to its intended destination without further incident.  The airplane's digital flight data recorder showed the aircraft encountered three vertical acceleration excursions between 1.449 g's and -0.379 g's over a 16-second period.    Probable Cause: The failure of the pilot-in-command to properly evaluate a hazardous weather advisory and his failure to adequately alter course and flight altitude to avoid the area of hazardous weather.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: LAX01LA136 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB LAX01LA136 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  13 June 2016 N654AW American Airlines 0 Phoenix-Sky Harbor International Airport, AZ (PHX/KPHX) min Cowling loss Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates25-Mar-2024 11:20 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

The captain stated that prior to departure the flight controls were tested, with no abnormalities noted, and the takeoff trim was set to the ""middle of the takeoff range,"" without referring to any available pitch trim charts. During the takeoff roll on runway 28, the pilot attempted to rotate the airplane twice, and then aborted the takeoff halfway down the 4,840 foot long runway, because the controls ""didn't feel right."" The airplane traveled off the departure end of the runway and through a fence, and came to rest near a road. The pilot reported no particular malfunction with the airplane. Examination of the airplane revealed that the horizontal stabilizer was positioned at -4.6 degrees, the maximum nose down limit within the takeoff range. The horizontal stabilizer trim and elevator controls were checked, and moved freely through their full ranges of travel. According to the AFM TAKEOFF TRIM C.G.

Following the collision, the airplane continued down the runway with the tires smoking, veered off the right side of the runway near the end, crossed a taxiway, impacted into a ditch and burst into flames. After the accident, the captain and first officer both reported that the thrust reversers failed to operate after they were deployed during the landing. Examination of the landing gear found all three gear collapsed. The right and left main tires had areas of rubber that were worn completely through. The flaps were found extended, and both thrust reversers were found in the stowed position. Examination of the cockpit found the throttles in the idle position, and the thrust reverser levers in the stowed position. Aircraft performance calculations indicate that the airplane traveled 1,500 feet down the runway after touchdown, in 4.2 seconds, before striking the deer. The calculations also indicate that the airplane landed with a ground speed of 124 knots. At 124 knots and maximum braking applied, the airplane should have come to a complete stop in about 850 feet. However, investigation of the accident site and surrounding area revealed heavy black skid marks beginning at the first taxiway turnoff about 1,500 feet down the 5,010 foot runway. The skid marks continued for about 2,500 feet, departed the right side of the runway and proceeded an additional 500 feet over grass and dirt. The investigation revealed that deer fur was found lodged in the squat switch on the left main landing gear, likely rendering the squat switch inoperative after the impact with the deer, and prior to the airplaneÂs loss of control on the runway. Since a valid signal from the squat switch is required for thrust reverser deployment, the loss of this signal forced the thrust reversers to stow. At this point, the electronic engine control (EEC) likely switched to the forward thrust schedule and engine power increased to near takeoff power, which led to the airplane to continue down the runway, and off of it. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""On ground collision with deer during landing roll, and the inadvertent thrust reverser stowage caused by the damage to the landing gear squat switch by the collision, and subsequent application of forward thrust during rollout.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ATL01FA021 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight crew was cleared by 'Iceman' to taxi out of the de-icing bay via taxiway Tango and hold short of Mike. As the captain applied thrust to manoeuver the aircraft forward, the right wing of the B747 struck de-icing truck number thirteen tipping it over and injuring the driver, who was the sole occupant of the vehicle. The driver was taken to hospital with serious but non-life threatening injuries.  Findings as to causes and contributing factors 1. By passing the de-icing strip, the zone de-icing controller (ZDC) indicated to Iceman that the de-icing procedure was complete. In fact, beta truck 13 was still in position ahead of the aircraft's right wing. 2. On receipt of the de-icing strip, Iceman concluded that the de-icing equipment was clear and issued movement instructions to the flight crew of the aircraft while beta truck 13 was still in position ahead of the aircraft's right wing. 3. One ZDC was monitoring four active de-icing pads instead of the usual three pads. This increased activity resulted in task saturation and frequency congestion for the ZDC. 4. Because of the increased activity and the radio congestion, the driver/operator of beta truck 13 was unable to effectively establish radio communication with the ZDC to advise that he was still in position in front of the aircraft.

The flight was operating on an instrument flight rules flight plan. The flight departed about 17:18 from Broomfield-Jeffco Airport, CO (BJC), with two pilots and eight passengers aboard. N81PF was one of three airplanes transporting members of the Oklahoma State University Cowboys basketball team and associated team personnel to Stillwater Regional Airport, OK (SWO), after a game at the University of Colorado at Boulder that afternoon. All 10 occupants aboard N81PF (two pilots, two players, and 6 OSU broadcasters & members of the OSU coaching staff) were killed, and the airplane was destroyed by impact forces and a post crash fire. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the pilotÂs spatial disorientation resulting from his failure to maintain positive manual control of the airplane with the available flight instrumentation. Contributing to the cause of the accident was the loss of a.c. electrical power during instrument meteorological conditions.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NTSB/AAR-03/01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB/AAR-03/01   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Strasburg, CO; 27 January 2001; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The cargo consisted of a.o. 14 barrels with 55 gallons of gasoline each. The aircraft departed El Yopal at 13:45. While attempting to land at MitÃº, the landing gear struck the ground short of the threshold of runway 01. The crew carried out a go around and assessed the situation. The left hand main gear was broken away and a hydraulic leak caused control problems. By switching from the yellow to the blue hydraulic system, the crew were able to regain control. After flying over the control tower at MitÃº, they were informed by the controller of the loss of the left main left gear. The flight crew then declared an emergency and informed the tower controller at MitÃº that they would proceed to BogotÃ¡. The crew was not able to fully raise the flaps, so a decision was made to divert to El Yopal/ The plane climbed to 10000 feet and proceeded to El Yopal at this altitude. The crew then observed that the left engine oil pressure was dropping and the pilot proceeded to shut down the engine. In these conditions the plane began to lose height and speed. They then established contact with the control tower of El Yopal, informing the them of the emergency. It was decided to perform another flyby of the tower, which confirmed the left main hear had separated. The crew then agreed to burn fuel from the left wing tank to avoid a fire on that side during the emergency landing. The fuel indicators showed unreliable values and calculations were difficult since last part of the flight was performed under irregular circumstances. It was then decided to select the left fuel tank and continue to burn fuel until the low fuel warning appeared. The co-pilot recommended the captain to try to restart the left engine to have both reversers available on landing, but the request was rejected. Flying to the South-West of El Yopal Airport, the pilot ordered the co-pilot to move further away from the runway, while taking his cell phone to communicate with the Director of Operations of the airline. When the low fuel alarm went off, they selected the right tank, and the captain decided to return to land.  During the approach the right engine began to fail. The plane lost height quickly until it impacted the ground 4.9 miles from the threshold of runway 05. The aircraft caught fire after the impact and was completely destroyed. PROBABLE CAUSE FIRST IMPACT OF THE AIRCRAFT IN MITU. Low situational alert by the pilot in command in the final approach phase to land. SECOND IMPACT OF THE AIRCRAFT ON THE YOPAL. Failure of the crew to adequately plan for the foreseeable emergency. CONTRIBUTING FACTOR Passive attitude of the crew, especially by the Commander of the aircraft in handling critical situations. Inappropriate handling of CRM, poor or inadequate communication in the cockpit. Little experience in flight hours as a commander by the pilot in command of the aircraft. Little experience inz total flight hours and in the equipment on the part of the co-pilot.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Aerocivil Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: El Tiempo  ICAO Adrep   Location  Images: photo (c) Alex Waning; Villavicencio-La Vanguardia Airport (VVC); 06 May 2000 photo (c) via Andy Herzog; BogotÃ¡-Eldorado Airport (BOG/SKBO); January 1997 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The fuel tank stringers and the wing ribs sustained structural damage.  The PIC stated that the fuel tanks had been repaired and pressure tested prior to the flight.  The PIC added that after the pressure test, the mechanic, who repaired the fuel tank, removed the tape from the right wing's fuel vent; however, both the mechanic and the flight crew failed to notice the duct tape over the left wing's fuel vent.  The flight crew stated that there were no streamers or markers present to indicate that the fuel tank vent was covered with duct tape.

The aircraft was cleared for the ILS/DME procedure for runway 28 and the crew requested the QFE which was 980 hPa. The decision height for the approach was 400 feet. At 1918:11 the crew reported that they were established on the localizer. When the aircraft intercepted the glidepath, the flaps were set to 15Â° correctly configuring the aircraft for the approach. The handling pilot recalled that initially the rate of descent was slightly higher than the expected 650 ft/min leading him to suspect the presence of a tailwind, however, the rate of descent returned to a more normal value when approximately 4 nm from the runway. The propellers were set to the maximum rpm at 1,200 feet agl. When the crew reported that they were inside 4 nm they were cleared to land and passed the surface wind, which was variable at 2 kt; they were also warned that the runway surface was wet. Both pilots saw the runway lights when approaching 400 feet agl; the flaps were selected to 30Â° and confirmed at that position. Both pilots believed that the airspeed was satisfactory but, as the commander checked back on the control column for the landing, the rate of descent increased noticeably and the aircraft landed firmly. Both pilots believed that the power levers were in the flight idle position and neither was aware of any unusual control inputs during the landing flare. The aircraft bounced before hitting the ground again, this time with the nose wheel first, before bouncing once more. The aircraft was then seen to travel about half way along the runway before slewing to the left and running onto the grass. When the aircraft stopped the left wing tip appeared to be touching the grass. CONCLUSION: ""Evidence from the CVR indicated that the flight was conducted in a thoroughly professional manner in accordance the operator's normal procedures until the final stages of the approach. The recorded data indicate that three seconds prior to touchdown the propeller blade angle changed from the flight range to the ground range. Coincident with this change the CVR recorded sounds consistent with the propellers 'disking' and the FDR indicated that the aircraft then decelerated longitudinally and accelerated downwards. The engineering investigation revealed that the propeller control rigging and the operation of the flight idle baulk were correct. Selection of ground fine requires the pilot to firstly release the flight idle baulk and then lift and pull the propeller levers further back, this combined action rapidly becomes a programmed motor skill in the routine of daily operations. It is therefore possible that the handling pilot unintentionally selected the propellers into the ground fine position whilst still in the air.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: AAIB Bulletin 10/2001 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Aviation Letter 417  Flight International 24-30 July 2001   Location  Images: photo (c) Steve Smith; Sheffield City Airport (SZD); 05 February 2001 photo (c) Steve Smith; Sheffield City Airport (SZD); 05 February 2001 photo (c) Joachim Bongers, via Werner Fischdick; Dublin Airport (DUB); September 2000 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The left main landing gear collapsed and the left wing, wing slats, and the No. 3 engine nacelle were damaged. Examination of the brake system found an electrical anomaly in one of two tacho-generators in the right main landing gear. Postaccident testing determined that the anomaly was not sufficient to affect brake performance. Analysis of cockpit voice recorder (CVR) information, weather data, and runway conditions indicated that the flight crew flew a straight-in global positioning system/non-directional beacon approach to runway 29. CVR and weather information indicated that bothÂ approaches to runway 29, including a missed approach, were flown below reported approach minimums of 2 miles visibility, although after the accident, the flight crew reported they had the runway in sight at 2 miles on the second approach. CVR information indicated that the final approach was unstabilized and required airplane configuration changes and maneuvering at a low altitude. Postaccident runway evidence (tire tracks on the snow-covered runway) indicated that the Falcon's right main landing gear touched down left of the runway centerline.

The airplane pushed forward against the tow bar, sheared a pin, bent the tow bar, and struck the tug.  Before engine start, maintenance personnel had conducted an automated check which included automatic movements of the control wheel and throttles. The flight crew returned to their seats while the test was being conducted.   At the completion of the test, the airplane was returned to service and maintenance personnel departed the cockpit.  The captain initiated the BEFORE STARTING ENGINES checklist without either pilot first completing a cockpit flow setup as required by company procedures.  The checklist was then interrupted by a cockpit visitor and a non-pertinent conversation took place for 3 1/2 minutes. When the checklist was resumed, several items had been missed.  As the checklist was continued, the call out THRUST LEVERS was made by the first officer, and the correct response of CLOSED was given by the captain.  Push back was initiated, and the captain verbalized starting the first engine as required by the checklist.  As the first engine was being started, the captain initiated another non-pertinent conversation with the first officer.  The second engine was then started without verbalization as required by company checklist procedures.  Although company checklist procedures made both pilots responsible for ensuring a normal start, neither pilot detected that the engines were accelerating above normal idle.  According to follow-up testing, the engines accelerated to a power setting that corresponded to the last position of the throttles at the completion of the automated test by maintenance. Probable Cause: the failure of the flight crew to follow the checklist prior to engine start, and their subsequent diverted attention during engine start.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NYC01LA077 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB NYC01LA077  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates05-Apr-2024 12:45 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

During their final ILS approach, the aircraft encountered heavy turbulence at about 200 feet agl. with gusts up to 65 mph. The aircraft encountered windshear with 1.25G updraft, downdraft and a tailwind gust at just 70 feet agl. When the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) sounded, the captain called for a go-around while pulling on the sidestick, reportedly without pressing his priority control button. The combination of dynamic winds and the crew actions created a situation that triggered the airplane's alpha protection system. As the crew applied TOGA power for a go-around, with both pilots pulling back on their sidesticks, the alpha protection law reduced the elevator nose-up command. Instead of a go- around, the aircraft struck the runway with a vertical speed of approx. 1,200 fpm. The nosegear collapsed and the aircraft skidded 3,280 feet (about 1000 m) down the runway before coming to a stop. CAUSES: ""The cause of the accident was the activation of the angle of attack protection system which, under a particular combination of vertical gusts and windshear and the simultaneous actions of both crew members on the sidesticks, not considered in the design, prevented the aeroplane from pitching up and flaring during the landing.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIA Report number: A-006/2001 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 years and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   Air Safety Week, Vol. 15, No. 25   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane, with two pilots and the chief technician of the operator on board, took off from runway 10 at 15:31. After five nautical miles the aircraft turned to the south. Less than three minutes after departure at an altitude of 5900 feet and an airspeed of 250 knots, the no. 1 engine failed. The captain decided to return to the airfield. Preparing for the approach to runway 10, the flaps were set at 8 degrees and the landing gear was extended. Because the aircraft was above the glideslope, power was reduced to idle and the flaps were lowered to 20 and a little later further down to 40 degrees. At that moment the airspeed dropped considerably. The thrust lever of the remaining right hand engine was then advanced to near takeoff power. Due to the asymmetric thrust the plane yawed to the left at a height of 200-300 feet. The captain ordered the first officer to raise the flaps back to the 20 degree position. The Learjet then stalled to the left, rolled inverted and crashed into trees. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The accident was caused by an in-flight failure of the left power plant appr. 3 minutes after take-off and an inadequate conduct of the subsequent single-engine land procedure so that in short final the airplane stalled and crashed from low height. The failure of the left engine was caused by intergranular fractures of retention posts on the high pressure turbine disk.

Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The flight was operating under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 121 as Great Lakes Flight 6798 and was on an active instrument flight plan. The captain and first officer (FO) reported no injuries. Eight passengers were released from the accident scene without treatment and seven passengers were transported to local area hospitals for evaluation and treatment of minor injuries. The flight originated at the Capital Airport, Springfield, Illinois at 1605. The crew unintentionally landed the airplane with the landing gear in the fully retracted position.  The crew did not lower the landing gear or check the landing gear position as required on the flaps-up landing checklist, the normal landing checklist, and final checklist.  According to the cockpit voice recorder (CVR), the landing gear unsafe warning horn did not sound during the entire recorded portion of the accident flight.  The minimum equipment list (MEL) requires the installation of a placard that prohibits the silencing of the landing gear warning horn when the flap system is inoperative.  The accident airplane had a placard that stated, ""Do not silence gear warning horn.""  No anomalies were found with the landing gear system including the landing gear unsafe warning horn, the red landing gear control handle lighting, and the landing gear position lights.  The flap system and ground proximity warning system (GPWS) were inoperative for the accident flight and were listed on the MEL as items that could be inoperative for revenue flight. Probable Cause: The flightcrew not lowering the landing gear and/or verifying the landing gear position as required by three separate checklists, which resulted in an inadvertent gear-up landing.  A factor to the accident was the flightcrew not complying with the required minimum equipment list placard that prohibited the silencing of the landing gear warning horn.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CHI01FA084 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  https://cdn.jetphotos.com/full/2/20473_1117105928.jpg (photo) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

According to the pilot he radioed ATC that he had the airport and runway in sight.   At 800 feet he lost sight of the runway because of ""light fog."" He performed a missed approach and stayed in the pattern VFR. On the second approach he was distracted by the fog, but said he did not lose sight of the runway.  He said that the co-pilot advised him to go around again but he landed.  He said the landing was hard, but did not realize he had a problem until the airplane started pulling to the left.  When the airplane came to a stop he got everyone out because of a fuel leak.  The 30-minute CVR recording was found to have no data that could contribute to determining the probable cause, and no transcript was prepared.  The reported visibility at the time of the accident was 0.25 sm mile with fog.  The pilot called the Saint Petersburg flight service station about 2 hours after the accident to report same. Probable Cause: the pilot misjudged the flare resulting in a hard landing, and impact with the runway.

The captain had the autopilot engaged as the airplane descended through 10,000 feet mean sea level.  The nose pitched down violently about 10 degrees, and then the nose pitched back up.  The captain disengaged the autopilot and hand flew the airplane to touchdown.  The Brasilia has two elevator trim actuators.  The manufacturer discovered moisture and corrosion in some of the actuators submitted for repair after similar occurrences.  They suspected that leaking seals allowed moisture into the actuators, which froze at altitude.  In numerous instances, the actuators functioned properly after descent to lower altitudes and warmer temperatures, where the units thawed.  One unit was dirty, corroded, and had overspray on it.  It leaked from the shaft seals and autoloc seal.  It failed the non-jamming stop test.  It's two shaft housings contained moisture.  The chain and pins were corroded, the packing had deteriorated, and the springs were weak.  One side of the rollers was not chamfered, and staking warped some screws.  The hub was worn and not functioning properly.  The second unit was dirty and had overspray on it.  The actuator leaked from the shaft seals.  The actuator had excessive backlash and failed the tangential free play test.  It's two shaft housings contained moisture.  The chain, pins, shafts, and housings were corroded.  The packing had deteriorated, and the bearings were rough and binding.  The rollers only had one chamfered side.  The shim was not with the unit.

After preparation for a Royal Mail charter flight 670A to Belfast, start clearance was given at 15:03. At 15:12Â hrs the crew advised ATC they were shutting down due to a technical problem. The crew then advised their company that a generator would not come on line. An avionics technician carried out diagnosis during which both engines were ground-run twice. No fault was found and the flight crew requested taxi clearance at 17:10. A normal take off from runway 06 was carried out followed by a reduction to climb power at 1,200 feet amsl. At 2,200 feet amsl the aircraft anti-icing systems were selected on. Three seconds later the torque on each engine reduced rapidly to zero. A MAYDAY call was made by the crew advising that they had experienced a double engine failure. The aircraft was ditched in the Firth of Forth estuary some 100 meters from the shoreline near Granton Harbour.  Weather reported just before the accident with a temperature of +2Â°C, dewpoint of -3Â°C, visibility of more then 10 km, broken clouds at 4500 feet and cover at 8000 feet. CAUSAL FACTORS: 1) The operator did not have an established practical procedure for flight crews to fit engine intake blanks (ÂbungsÂ) in adverse weather conditions. This meant that the advice contained in the aircraft manufacturerÂs Maintenance Manual ÂFreezing weather-precautionsÂ was not complied with. Furthermore intake blanks were not provided on the aircraft nor were any readily available at Edinburgh Airport. 2) A significant amount of snow almost certainly entered into the engine air intakes as a result of the aircraft being parked heading directly into strong surface winds during conditions of light to moderate snowfall overnight. 3) The flow characteristics of the engine intake system most probably allowed large volumes of snow, ice or slush to accumulate in areas where it would not have been readily visible to the crew during a normal pre-flight inspection. 4) At some stage, probably after engine ground running began, the deposits of snow, ice or slush almost certainly migrated from the plenum chambers down to the region of the intake anti-ice vanes. Conditions in the intakes prior to takeoff are considered to have caused re-freezing of the contaminant, allowing a significant proportion to remain in a state which precluded its ingestion into the engines during taxi, takeoff and initial climb. 5) Movement of the intake anti-icing vanes, acting in conjunction with the presence of snow, ice or slush in the intake systems, altered the engine intake air flow conditions and resulted in the near simultaneous flameout of both engines. 6) The standard operating procedure of selecting both intake anti-ice vane switches simultaneously, rather than sequentially with a time interval, eliminated a valuable means of protection against a simultaneous double engine flameout.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: AAIB AAR 2/03 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) AAIB; near Granton Harbour; February 2001 photo (c) AAIB; near Granton Harbour; 28 February 2001 photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Glasgow International Airport (GLA); August 1999 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All of the passengers were members of a Virginia-based military construction and engineering crew on a routine training mission. The plane's pilot and two other crew members were members of the 171st Aviation Regiment of the Florida Army National Guard It appeared that the pilot's decision to go to the bathroom shifted the weight of the already unbalanced plane and caused it to become unstable and uncontrollable while in an area of strong turbulence. The nose of the plane slowly pitched up and then abruptly dropped just before the crash. In three seconds, the plane rose more than 100 feet with its nose down, and was then rocked by wind shear three times greater than what is defined as extreme turbulence. Within the first 12 seconds that they encountered problems, the G-force shifts rendered the crew and passengers incapacitated and unconscious and caused the breakup of the aircraft in flight. It was also established that the weather radar was underpowered, negatively impacting the ability of the crew to successfully circumnavigate around the severe weather. This C-23B Sherpa was originally built as a Shorts 360 (SH-3684) in December 1985 and was delivered to Simmons Airlines as N374MQ In 1998 the aircraft was converted to a Sherpa C-23B+. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The Collateral Investigation Board found the preponderance of the evidence concluded that the aircraft accident was due to crew error. The board found other factors present but not contributing directly to this aircraft accident. These factors may have influenced the crew's decision making process and aircraft performance. This is normally the case in most aircraft human factor accidents. The board did find the preponderance of the evidence directed the board toward the crew's failure to properly load the aircraft. In particular, the crew's failure to properly manage the weight and balance of the aircraft resulted in an 'out-of-CG' condition that exceeded the aircraft design limits, rendering the aircraft unstable and leading to a violent departure from controlled flight. Once the aircraft departed controlled flight, the rapid onset of significant G-force shifts rendered the crew and passengers incapacitated and unconscious and led to a structural break-up of the aircraft in flight. This ultimately resulted in the aircraft impacting the ground, killing all on board.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: USAF AIB Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Pete Whybrow  St. Petersburg Times   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

An engine examination and teardown determined that the #5 bearing assembly had failed.  Additional examination ascertained that the P2.5/P3 switching valve to rear inlet case sealing air tube had become disconnected, and the NL probe port sealing tube had melted, allowing an oil fed fire outside of the engine casing and into the engine compartment.  Investigation determined that the engine had not been placed on oil consumption and daily chip detector examination by company maintenance as required by the engine maintenance manual following a loss of oil event approximately 180 hours previous to the fire.  Additionally, the mandatory implementation of P&W service bulletin 20914, which addressed the P2.5/P3 switching valve to rear inlet case sealing air tube and NL probe port sealing tube was not carried out by the company, nor was it required, as the FAA airworthiness directive making the service bulletin mandatory did not include the PW120A engine.  The investigation also revealed that the company mandated implementation of P&W service bulletin 21446R3, was not carried out during an earlier hot section inspection and immediately preceding the earlier oil loss event. Probable Cause: The failure of the number 5 engine bearing assembly followed by the disconnection of the P2.5/P3 switching valve to rear inlet case sealing air tube and the melting of the NL probe port (sealing tube) which allowed an oil fed fire beyond the constraints of the engine casing and into the engine nacelle.  A contributing factor was the company's failure to follow several maintenance procedures within the maintenance manual after a previous oil loss event.  A second factor was the omission of the PW120A engine from the airworthiness directive issued by the FAA which mandated the completion of Pratt & Whitney service bulletin 20914.  The lack of inclusion of the PW120A engine in the AD resulted in the company's correct interpretation that the service bulletin was not mandatory.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: SEA01FA059 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB SEA01FA059  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates05-Apr-2024 11:45 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

The ILS Runway 06 approach was in use.  Braking action advisories were in effect, and all surfaces were covered with thin wet snow.  During the approach to the airport, with the Second-in-Command (SIC) at the controls, the PIC visually observed that the hydraulic pressure gauge, ""smiley face,"" was normal, and he performed a ""brake test.""  The tower controller advised the flightcrew that a Navajo had just landed and reported a 250-foot ceiling, 3/4 miles of visibility, and that the runway braking action was ""good.""  On final approach, the airplane broke out of the overcast clouds about 400 feet above the ground.  The runway appeared dry, with only blowing snow across it.  As the airplane touched down about 1,463 feet beyond the approach end of the 4,677-foot long runway on the runway, the SIC stated that she did not have any braking effectiveness, and selected the ""dump flaps"" to slow the airplane.  The airplane continued down the runway and did not seem to be slowing to a safe speed.  The flightcrew observed the 1,000-foot marker approaching and the SIC selected the emergency brakes.  After she felt a lack of deceleration, the SIC selected the parking brake.  The airplane continued off the end of the runway, impacted a non-frangible fence, and came to rest with about 4 feet of the airplane protruding onto a public access road.  Examination of the airplane revealed a reference speed set on the pilot's airspeed indicator of 117 knots.  According to the Hawker Siddeley HS-125 Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) performance section, the uncorrected landing distance, on a dry runway, at the estimated landing weight of the airplane was approximately 2,610 feet.  The AFM performance section also had a chart for the ""Effect of Slippery Runway on Landing Distance.""  The chart determined that the ""equivalent scheduled landing distance available,"" was approximately 2,150 feet.  According to airport records, a NOTAM was issued the day of the accident, which referenced the condition of the runway surfaces as having ""Thin wet snow all surfaces.""  An air traffic controller observed slush ""spraying"" from the airplane, which extended 5 feet from the airplane, as the airplane rolled out.  The airplane's braking system was tested after the accident and no abnormalities were noted. Probable Cause: The pilot-in-commands inadequate preflight planning resulting in an approach to a runway with insufficient length.  A factor related to  the accident was the slush covered runway which resulted in a hydroplaning condition.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NYC01FA084 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB NYC01FA084  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates05-Apr-2024 11:39 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

According to the captain, while at flight level FL310, a speed of mach .80, he got a warning of cabin altitude, he ran the checklist and performed an emergency descent to FL 100, where fuel was dumped and subsequent landing was performed back at Puerto Plata. No injuries were reported. After landing examination revealed that the left over wing slide compartment door was missing and the slide had disintegrated. Two holes were found in the left aft fuselage skin. In addition, electrical wires were damaged.

The flight crew reported that at an airspeed of approximately 110 knots, the nose of the airplane began to lift off. The captain attempted to lower the nose, however, the airplane was unresponsive. The airplane became airborne and climbed to an altitude of 20 to 30 feet above the runway. The captain reduced the power on both engines and the airplane settled to the runway, striking the tail. The airplane traveled approximately 700 feet off the end of the runway where it came to rest in the muddy terrain. An emergency evacuation was performed during which the L2 evacuation slide did not deploy. During the investigation, NTSB determined that the airplane was loaded so that its center of gravity (CG), although within limits, was in the aft region of the permissible range. Further, the flight crew had incorrectly set the trim for the trimmable horizontal stabilizer (THS) at -1.7Â°UP (airplane nose up). This setting resulted in a pitch-up trim condition. The proper trim setting, 1.7Â°DN (airplane nose down), would have resulted in a correct trim condition for the way the airplane was loaded. The improperly set trim caused the nose of the airplane to lift off the runway prematurely. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The pilot induced oscillations and the delay in aborting the takeoff. Factors associated with the accident were the first officer used an improper trim setting and the captain did not identify and correct the setting during the taxi checklist, and the wet runway conditions.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CHI01FA104 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB id CHI01FA104   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane was being controlled by the autopilot at about 18,000 feet when they encountered instrument meteorological conditions that rapidly led to the windscreen being covered by a layer of ice. The crew turned ice protection systems on and the ice on the windshield was cleared. The first officer observed ice on the right wing's boots and the right prop's spinner that extended farther back than he had previously experienced. The first officer then switched the ice protection systems to their highest settings. De airspeed then decreased from 1750 to 160 kts. The captain disconnected the autopilot, applied power, and initiated nose down pitch inputs to arrest the airspeed loss. They indicated that these actions were unsuccessful and the speed further deteriorated to about 130 knots at which point the airplane rolled about 90 degrees to the left, and then back to near level. In the next 24 seconds, the airplane again rolled about 110 degrees to the left, back to level, then about 120 degrees to the right, back to level, and then rolled 360 degrees to the right, back to near wings level. Since the crew reported trouble with the flight attitude instruments, the roll angles recorded on the FDR are being further investigated. The maximum nose down pitch attitude was 60 degrees, the maximum recorded airspeed was about 240 kias, and maximum vertical acceleration during recovery was about +3.6 g. The crew immediately diverted to West Palm Beach and landed there 12 minutes after the upset.

While on finals over the 'Col de la Tourmente', the aircraft was seen making a sharp turn to the left. The Twin Otter struck a house on the 'Col de la Tourmente' and caught fire. A man on the ground was also killed and his wife was injured. While on finals the captain probably  selected ""beta reverse range"" on the propellers in order to slow down. Upon vigorously pushing back the power levers to their normal position, an asymmetric power condition developed. The Twin Otter rolled to the left and crashed. Saint-BarthÃ©lÃ©my is known for the difficult approach to the airport and pilots flying into Saint-BarthÃ©lÃ©my need to have a special certification. After overflying 'Col de la Tourmente' a quick steep descent has to be made to land at runway 10, a 2100 feet runway which ends up in sea. The aircraft overfly the 'Col de la Tourmente' at a height of 10 m or less. PROBABLE CAUSES: ""The accident appears to result from the Captain's use of the propellers in the reverse beta range, to improve control of his track on short final. A strong thrust asymmetry at the moment when coming out of the reverse beta range would have caused the loss of yaw control, then roll control of the aircraft. The investigation could not exclude three other hypotheses which can nevertheless be classified as quite unlikely: - A loss of control during a go-around. - A loss of control due to a stall. - A loss of control due to sudden incapacitation of one of the pilots. The Captain's lack of recent experience on this airplane type, the undeniable difficulty of conducting an approach to runway 10 at Saint-BarthÃ©lemy and the pressure of time during this flight were contributory factors. The low height at which the loss of control occurred was an aggravating factor.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Report number: BEA F-ES010324 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   AP  BEA (Bureau Enquetes-Accidents)  Reuters   Location  Images: photo (c) Philippe MolÃ©; Saint-BarthÃ©lÃ©my Airport, Guadeloupe (SBH); March 2001 photo (c) Philippe MolÃ©; Saint-BarthÃ©lÃ©my Airport, Guadeloupe (SBH) photo (c) Philippe MolÃ©; Saint-BarthÃ©lÃ©my Airport, Guadeloupe (SBH) photo (c) Philippe MolÃ©; Saint-BarthÃ©lÃ©my Airport, Guadeloupe (SBH) photo (c) Philippe MolÃ©; Saint-BarthÃ©lÃ©my Airport, Guadeloupe (SBH) photo (c) Philippe MolÃ©; Saint-BarthÃ©lÃ©my Airport, Guadeloupe (SBH) photo (c) Philippe MolÃ©; Saint-BarthÃ©lÃ©my Airport, Guadeloupe (SBH) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

At 05:45, the aircraft departed Halifax for St. John's. The pilot flying was completing his line indoctrination training after having recently upgraded to captain. En route the crew were advised of a NOTAM that the ILS for runway 11 was unserviceable. Because of the marginal weather, the loss of runway 11/29, and his greater experience, the training captain decided to switch seats and assume the duties and full responsibilities as captain and pilot flying. Clearance for an ILS approach to runway 16 was obtained from Gander ACC, and the crew was advised to contact St. John's tower. Just over two minutes before landing, the tower advised that the wind was 050Â° (estimated) at 20, gusting to 35, knots. The aircraft crossed the final approach fix on the ILS glideslope at 150 KIAS. During the final approach, the airspeed steadily increased to 180 KIAS (ground speed 190 knots); the glidepath was maintained with a descent rate of 1000 feet per minute. From 1000 feet above sea level, no airspeed calls were made; altitude calls were made and responses were made. The Royal Boeing 737 operations manual states that the PNF shall call out significant deviations from programmed airspeed. In the descent, through 900 feet above sea level, the aircraft encountered turbulence resulting in uncommanded roll and pitch deviations and airspeed fluctuations of Â±11 knots. At about 300 feet above decision height, the crew acquired visual references for landing. They were cleared to land. The aircraft touched down at 164 KIAS (27 KIAS above the desired touchdown speed of Vref), 2300 to 2500 feet beyond the threshold. The wind at this point was determined to be about 050Â° at 30 knots. Shortly after touchdown, the speed brakes and thrust reversers were deployed. With approximately 1100 feet of runway remaining, through a speed of 64 KIAS, reverse thrust increased to about 1.97 EPR on engine 1 and 2.15 EPR on engine 2. As the aircraft approached the end of the runway, the captain attempted to steer the aircraft to the right, toward the Delta taxiway intersection. Twenty-two seconds after touchdown, the aircraft exited the departure end of the runway into deep snow. The aircraft came to rest approximately 75 feet beyond and 53 feet to the right of the runway centreline. The 737 has been stored at Saint John's since the accident. The aircraft sustained serious damage to the landing gear and the left engine detached from the wing. Royal Airlines was acquired by Canada 3000 later that year. The 737 has been stored at Saint John's since the accident. Royal Airlines was acquired by Canada 3000 later that year. Canada 3000 went bankrupt late 2001. FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: ""A combination of excessive landing speed, extended touchdown point, and low runway friction coefficient resulted in the aircraft overrunning the runway.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: TSB Report A01A0028 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) David Knudsen; Vancouver International Airport, BC (YVR); 15 April 2000 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight was an uneventful transit until the landing. The aerodrome was clearly visible and the commander made a visual approach in accordance to the aerodrome STAR charts. The approach was stabilized, despite the aircraft encountering a windshear at GELO. At 30 feet RA the commander noticed that the aircraft had developed a high sink rate and he attempted to decrease the rate of descent with full aft side stick but the aircraft landed heavily and bounced. At the second touch down the aircraft tail contacted the runway. The aircraft had suffered tail structural damage. There were no personal injuries Causes The investigation concluded that the marked backing of the wind, probably due to turbulence from the adjacent high ground, had caused the loss of headwind component. The application of full aft side stick had reduced the vertical speed of the initial touch down. In an attempt to cushion the second touch down by maintaining a degree of aft side stick during the bounce, the aircraft had continued to pitch up beyond the aircraft geometry limit causing the tail section to contact the runway.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: GPIAA Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 years and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: ICAO Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates18-Sep-2024 18:53 ASN Added 18-Sep-2024 19:24 ASN Updated [Aircraft type, Operator, Location, Nature, Departure airport, Destination airport, Narrative, Accident report, ]18-Sep-2024 19:25 ASN Updated [Location, Destination airport, ] Corrections or additions? ...

About 30 minutes before the turbulence was encountered, the company flight dispatcher communicated to the flight crew that the flight was approaching an area of forecast moderate to severe turbulence associated with mountain wave activity between FL310 and FL390 (39,000 feet).  The dispatcher recommended that the flight alter course and descend to FL280 (28,000 feet).  Eighteen minutes before the turbulence was encountered the pilot requested a ""ride report"" at FL310 from air traffic control and was told to expect ""occasional light chop, nothing real bad.""  The pilot remained at FL310 and remained on the existing routing.  Approaching the area of forecast turbulence, he illuminated the seat belt sign and advised the passengers of the potential for turbulence.  He also advised the flight attendants to stow the galley equipment.  Approximately 3 to 4 minutes later, the flight encountered turbulence.  The injured flight attendant was one of two in the aft galley.  The other flight attendant reported that when the turbulence started they were ""jolted"" a couple of times during which she recalled her feet came off the floor and then the turbulence subsided.  They ""scrambled"" toward their jumpseats; however, they encountered additional, more severe, turbulence and it became impossible to hold onto anything.  She recalled being thrown about the galley; hitting the ceiling, counters, and doors before being ""slammed"" to the floor.  When the turbulence ceased, the flight descended to flight level 280 and continued to its intended destination without further incident.  The airplane's digital flight data recorder showed the aircraft encountered three vertical acceleration excursions between 1.449 g's and -0.379 g's over a 16-second period.    Probable Cause: The failure of the pilot-in-command to properly evaluate a hazardous weather advisory and his failure to adequately alter course and flight altitude to avoid the area of hazardous weather.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: LAX01LA136 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB LAX01LA136 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  13 June 2016 N654AW American Airlines 0 Phoenix-Sky Harbor International Airport, AZ (PHX/KPHX) min Cowling loss Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates25-Mar-2024 11:20 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

The flight crew was advised of a heading to fly which led the airplane into a cloud that was not depicted on the weather avoidance radar.  ""In this cloud we encountered moderate to severe turbulence....""  According to the American Eagle Safety/Flight Service Trip Report (FSTR) which is an attachment to this report, ""[flight attendant] Alvarez was finishing her beverage service and they hit turbulence.  She flew into the air twice and cart came down on her right leg.  She was on her way to the galley to stow cart.""  The captain also reported that the autopilot which was on at the time, did not disengage.  A passenger who is an emergency medical technician (EMT), attended to the passenger and was assisted initially by the first officer.  A medical emergency was declared and the flight continued to the destination airport and landed uneventfully.  The first report to ATC occurred at 1448 local, when, while approaching the JUNUR intersection, a flightcrew member declared a medical emergency and advised the controller that the flight had encountered turbulence 50 miles back. Probable Cause: The in-flight encounter with moderate to severe turbulence in clouds resulting in the serious injury to the flight attendant.  A contributing factor in the accident was the poor in-flight planning by the captain for his allowing beverage service to continue after being advised by ATC of an area of turbulence that was approximately 4 minutes ahead of their position.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: MIA01LA131 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB MIA01LA131 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates25-Mar-2024 11:19 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

The certificated airline transport pilot, commercial pilot, and passenger were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and an IFR flight plan was filed for the air response medical flight to New York-La Guardia Airport, NY (LGA). The captain stated that prior to departure the flight controls were tested, with no abnormalities noted, and the takeoff trim was set to the ""middle of the takeoff range,"" without referring to any available pitch trim charts. During the takeoff roll on runway 28, the pilot attempted to rotate the airplane twice, and then aborted the takeoff halfway down the 4,840 foot long runway, because the controls ""didn't feel right."" The airplane traveled off the departure end of the runway and through a fence, and came to rest near a road. The pilot reported no particular malfunction with the airplane. Examination of the airplane revealed that the horizontal stabilizer was positioned at -4.6 degrees, the maximum nose down limit within the takeoff range. The horizontal stabilizer trim and elevator controls were checked, and moved freely through their full ranges of travel. According to the AFM TAKEOFF TRIM C.G.

Following the collision, the airplane continued down the runway with the tires smoking, veered off the right side of the runway near the end, crossed a taxiway, impacted into a ditch and burst into flames. After the accident, the captain and first officer both reported that the thrust reversers failed to operate after they were deployed during the landing. Examination of the landing gear found all three gear collapsed. The right and left main tires had areas of rubber that were worn completely through. The flaps were found extended, and both thrust reversers were found in the stowed position. Examination of the cockpit found the throttles in the idle position, and the thrust reverser levers in the stowed position. Aircraft performance calculations indicate that the airplane traveled 1,500 feet down the runway after touchdown, in 4.2 seconds, before striking the deer. The calculations also indicate that the airplane landed with a ground speed of 124 knots. At 124 knots and maximum braking applied, the airplane should have come to a complete stop in about 850 feet. However, investigation of the accident site and surrounding area revealed heavy black skid marks beginning at the first taxiway turnoff about 1,500 feet down the 5,010 foot runway. The skid marks continued for about 2,500 feet, departed the right side of the runway and proceeded an additional 500 feet over grass and dirt. The investigation revealed that deer fur was found lodged in the squat switch on the left main landing gear, likely rendering the squat switch inoperative after the impact with the deer, and prior to the airplaneÂs loss of control on the runway. Since a valid signal from the squat switch is required for thrust reverser deployment, the loss of this signal forced the thrust reversers to stow. At this point, the electronic engine control (EEC) likely switched to the forward thrust schedule and engine power increased to near takeoff power, which led to the airplane to continue down the runway, and off of it. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""On ground collision with deer during landing roll, and the inadvertent thrust reverser stowage caused by the damage to the landing gear squat switch by the collision, and subsequent application of forward thrust during rollout.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ATL01FA021 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight crew was cleared by 'Iceman' to taxi out of the de-icing bay via taxiway Tango and hold short of Mike. As the captain applied thrust to manoeuver the aircraft forward, the right wing of the B747 struck de-icing truck number thirteen tipping it over and injuring the driver, who was the sole occupant of the vehicle. The driver was taken to hospital with serious but non-life threatening injuries.  Findings as to causes and contributing factors 1. By passing the de-icing strip, the zone de-icing controller (ZDC) indicated to Iceman that the de-icing procedure was complete. In fact, beta truck 13 was still in position ahead of the aircraft's right wing. 2. On receipt of the de-icing strip, Iceman concluded that the de-icing equipment was clear and issued movement instructions to the flight crew of the aircraft while beta truck 13 was still in position ahead of the aircraft's right wing. 3. One ZDC was monitoring four active de-icing pads instead of the usual three pads. This increased activity resulted in task saturation and frequency congestion for the ZDC. 4. Because of the increased activity and the radio congestion, the driver/operator of beta truck 13 was unable to effectively establish radio communication with the ZDC to advise that he was still in position in front of the aircraft.

The cargo consisted of a.o. 14 barrels with 55 gallons of gasoline each. The aircraft departed El Yopal at 13:45. While attempting to land at MitÃº, the landing gear struck the ground short of the threshold of runway 01. The crew carried out a go around and assessed the situation. The left hand main gear was broken away and a hydraulic leak caused control problems. By switching from the yellow to the blue hydraulic system, the crew were able to regain control. After flying over the control tower at MitÃº, they were informed by the controller of the loss of the left main left gear. The flight crew then declared an emergency and informed the tower controller at MitÃº that they would proceed to BogotÃ¡. The crew was not able to fully raise the flaps, so a decision was made to divert to El Yopal/ The plane climbed to 10000 feet and proceeded to El Yopal at this altitude. The crew then observed that the left engine oil pressure was dropping and the pilot proceeded to shut down the engine. In these conditions the plane began to lose height and speed. They then established contact with the control tower of El Yopal, informing the them of the emergency. It was decided to perform another flyby of the tower, which confirmed the left main hear had separated. The crew then agreed to burn fuel from the left wing tank to avoid a fire on that side during the emergency landing. The fuel indicators showed unreliable values and calculations were difficult since last part of the flight was performed under irregular circumstances. It was then decided to select the left fuel tank and continue to burn fuel until the low fuel warning appeared. The co-pilot recommended the captain to try to restart the left engine to have both reversers available on landing, but the request was rejected. Flying to the South-West of El Yopal Airport, the pilot ordered the co-pilot to move further away from the runway, while taking his cell phone to communicate with the Director of Operations of the airline. When the low fuel alarm went off, they selected the right tank, and the captain decided to return to land.  During the approach the right engine began to fail. The plane lost height quickly until it impacted the ground 4.9 miles from the threshold of runway 05. The aircraft caught fire after the impact and was completely destroyed. PROBABLE CAUSE FIRST IMPACT OF THE AIRCRAFT IN MITU. Low situational alert by the pilot in command in the final approach phase to land. SECOND IMPACT OF THE AIRCRAFT ON THE YOPAL. Failure of the crew to adequately plan for the foreseeable emergency. CONTRIBUTING FACTOR Passive attitude of the crew, especially by the Commander of the aircraft in handling critical situations. Inappropriate handling of CRM, poor or inadequate communication in the cockpit. Little experience in flight hours as a commander by the pilot in command of the aircraft. Little experience inz total flight hours and in the equipment on the part of the co-pilot.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Aerocivil Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: El Tiempo  ICAO Adrep   Location  Images: photo (c) Alex Waning; Villavicencio-La Vanguardia Airport (VVC); 06 May 2000 photo (c) via Andy Herzog; BogotÃ¡-Eldorado Airport (BOG/SKBO); January 1997 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The fuel tank stringers and the wing ribs sustained structural damage.  The PIC stated that the fuel tanks had been repaired and pressure tested prior to the flight.  The PIC added that after the pressure test, the mechanic, who repaired the fuel tank, removed the tape from the right wing's fuel vent; however, both the mechanic and the flight crew failed to notice the duct tape over the left wing's fuel vent.  The flight crew stated that there were no streamers or markers present to indicate that the fuel tank vent was covered with duct tape.

The aircraft was cleared for the ILS/DME procedure for runway 28 and the crew requested the QFE which was 980 hPa. The decision height for the approach was 400 feet. At 1918:11 the crew reported that they were established on the localizer. When the aircraft intercepted the glidepath, the flaps were set to 15Â° correctly configuring the aircraft for the approach. The handling pilot recalled that initially the rate of descent was slightly higher than the expected 650 ft/min leading him to suspect the presence of a tailwind, however, the rate of descent returned to a more normal value when approximately 4 nm from the runway. The propellers were set to the maximum rpm at 1,200 feet agl. When the crew reported that they were inside 4 nm they were cleared to land and passed the surface wind, which was variable at 2 kt; they were also warned that the runway surface was wet. Both pilots saw the runway lights when approaching 400 feet agl; the flaps were selected to 30Â° and confirmed at that position. Both pilots believed that the airspeed was satisfactory but, as the commander checked back on the control column for the landing, the rate of descent increased noticeably and the aircraft landed firmly. Both pilots believed that the power levers were in the flight idle position and neither was aware of any unusual control inputs during the landing flare. The aircraft bounced before hitting the ground again, this time with the nose wheel first, before bouncing once more. The aircraft was then seen to travel about half way along the runway before slewing to the left and running onto the grass. When the aircraft stopped the left wing tip appeared to be touching the grass. CONCLUSION: ""Evidence from the CVR indicated that the flight was conducted in a thoroughly professional manner in accordance the operator's normal procedures until the final stages of the approach. The recorded data indicate that three seconds prior to touchdown the propeller blade angle changed from the flight range to the ground range. Coincident with this change the CVR recorded sounds consistent with the propellers 'disking' and the FDR indicated that the aircraft then decelerated longitudinally and accelerated downwards. The engineering investigation revealed that the propeller control rigging and the operation of the flight idle baulk were correct. Selection of ground fine requires the pilot to firstly release the flight idle baulk and then lift and pull the propeller levers further back, this combined action rapidly becomes a programmed motor skill in the routine of daily operations.

The left main landing gear collapsed and the left wing, wing slats, and the No. 3 engine nacelle were damaged. Examination of the brake system found an electrical anomaly in one of two tacho-generators in the right main landing gear. Postaccident testing determined that the anomaly was not sufficient to affect brake performance. Analysis of cockpit voice recorder (CVR) information, weather data, and runway conditions indicated that the flight crew flew a straight-in global positioning system/non-directional beacon approach to runway 29. CVR and weather information indicated that bothÂ approaches to runway 29, including a missed approach, were flown below reported approach minimums of 2 miles visibility, although after the accident, the flight crew reported they had the runway in sight at 2 miles on the second approach. CVR information indicated that the final approach was unstabilized and required airplane configuration changes and maneuvering at a low altitude. Postaccident runway evidence (tire tracks on the snow-covered runway) indicated that the Falcon's right main landing gear touched down left of the runway centerline. The airport manager reported that light snow covered the runway and that there was no evidence of skidding. Probable Cause: **This report was modified on 2/18/2016.

The airplane pushed forward against the tow bar, sheared a pin, bent the tow bar, and struck the tug.  Before engine start, maintenance personnel had conducted an automated check which included automatic movements of the control wheel and throttles. The flight crew returned to their seats while the test was being conducted.   At the completion of the test, the airplane was returned to service and maintenance personnel departed the cockpit.  The captain initiated the BEFORE STARTING ENGINES checklist without either pilot first completing a cockpit flow setup as required by company procedures.  The checklist was then interrupted by a cockpit visitor and a non-pertinent conversation took place for 3 1/2 minutes. When the checklist was resumed, several items had been missed.  As the checklist was continued, the call out THRUST LEVERS was made by the first officer, and the correct response of CLOSED was given by the captain.  Push back was initiated, and the captain verbalized starting the first engine as required by the checklist.  As the first engine was being started, the captain initiated another non-pertinent conversation with the first officer.  The second engine was then started without verbalization as required by company checklist procedures.  Although company checklist procedures made both pilots responsible for ensuring a normal start, neither pilot detected that the engines were accelerating above normal idle.  According to follow-up testing, the engines accelerated to a power setting that corresponded to the last position of the throttles at the completion of the automated test by maintenance.

During their final ILS approach, the aircraft encountered heavy turbulence at about 200 feet agl. with gusts up to 65 mph. The aircraft encountered windshear with 1.25G updraft, downdraft and a tailwind gust at just 70 feet agl. When the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) sounded, the captain called for a go-around while pulling on the sidestick, reportedly without pressing his priority control button. The combination of dynamic winds and the crew actions created a situation that triggered the airplane's alpha protection system. As the crew applied TOGA power for a go-around, with both pilots pulling back on their sidesticks, the alpha protection law reduced the elevator nose-up command. Instead of a go- around, the aircraft struck the runway with a vertical speed of approx. 1,200 fpm. The nosegear collapsed and the aircraft skidded 3,280 feet (about 1000 m) down the runway before coming to a stop. CAUSES: ""The cause of the accident was the activation of the angle of attack protection system which, under a particular combination of vertical gusts and windshear and the simultaneous actions of both crew members on the sidesticks, not considered in the design, prevented the aeroplane from pitching up and flaring during the landing.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIA Report number: A-006/2001 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 years and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   Air Safety Week, Vol. 15, No. 25   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane, with two pilots and the chief technician of the operator on board, took off from runway 10 at 15:31. After five nautical miles the aircraft turned to the south. Less than three minutes after departure at an altitude of 5900 feet and an airspeed of 250 knots, the no. 1 engine failed. The captain decided to return to the airfield. Preparing for the approach to runway 10, the flaps were set at 8 degrees and the landing gear was extended. Because the aircraft was above the glideslope, power was reduced to idle and the flaps were lowered to 20 and a little later further down to 40 degrees. At that moment the airspeed dropped considerably. The thrust lever of the remaining right hand engine was then advanced to near takeoff power. Due to the asymmetric thrust the plane yawed to the left at a height of 200-300 feet. The captain ordered the first officer to raise the flaps back to the 20 degree position. The Learjet then stalled to the left, rolled inverted and crashed into trees. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The accident was caused by an in-flight failure of the left power plant appr. 3 minutes after take-off and an inadequate conduct of the subsequent single-engine land procedure so that in short final the airplane stalled and crashed from low height. The failure of the left engine was caused by intergranular fractures of retention posts on the high pressure turbine disk.

Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The flight was operating under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 121 as Great Lakes Flight 6798 and was on an active instrument flight plan. The captain and first officer (FO) reported no injuries. Eight passengers were released from the accident scene without treatment and seven passengers were transported to local area hospitals for evaluation and treatment of minor injuries. The flight originated at the Capital Airport, Springfield, Illinois at 1605. The crew unintentionally landed the airplane with the landing gear in the fully retracted position.  The crew did not lower the landing gear or check the landing gear position as required on the flaps-up landing checklist, the normal landing checklist, and final checklist.  According to the cockpit voice recorder (CVR), the landing gear unsafe warning horn did not sound during the entire recorded portion of the accident flight.  The minimum equipment list (MEL) requires the installation of a placard that prohibits the silencing of the landing gear warning horn when the flap system is inoperative.  The accident airplane had a placard that stated, ""Do not silence gear warning horn.""  No anomalies were found with the landing gear system including the landing gear unsafe warning horn, the red landing gear control handle lighting, and the landing gear position lights.  The flap system and ground proximity warning system (GPWS) were inoperative for the accident flight and were listed on the MEL as items that could be inoperative for revenue flight. Probable Cause: The flightcrew not lowering the landing gear and/or verifying the landing gear position as required by three separate checklists, which resulted in an inadvertent gear-up landing.  A factor to the accident was the flightcrew not complying with the required minimum equipment list placard that prohibited the silencing of the landing gear warning horn.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CHI01FA084 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  https://cdn.jetphotos.com/full/2/20473_1117105928.jpg (photo) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

The captain had the autopilot engaged as the airplane descended through 10,000 feet mean sea level.  The nose pitched down violently about 10 degrees, and then the nose pitched back up.  The captain disengaged the autopilot and hand flew the airplane to touchdown.  The Brasilia has two elevator trim actuators.  The manufacturer discovered moisture and corrosion in some of the actuators submitted for repair after similar occurrences.  They suspected that leaking seals allowed moisture into the actuators, which froze at altitude.  In numerous instances, the actuators functioned properly after descent to lower altitudes and warmer temperatures, where the units thawed.  One unit was dirty, corroded, and had overspray on it.  It leaked from the shaft seals and autoloc seal.  It failed the non-jamming stop test.  It's two shaft housings contained moisture.  The chain and pins were corroded, the packing had deteriorated, and the springs were weak.  One side of the rollers was not chamfered, and staking warped some screws.  The hub was worn and not functioning properly.  The second unit was dirty and had overspray on it.  The actuator leaked from the shaft seals.  The actuator had excessive backlash and failed the tangential free play test.  It's two shaft housings contained moisture.  The chain, pins, shafts, and housings were corroded.  The packing had deteriorated, and the bearings were rough and binding.  The rollers only had one chamfered side.  The shim was not with the unit.

After preparation for a Royal Mail charter flight 670A to Belfast, start clearance was given at 15:03. At 15:12Â hrs the crew advised ATC they were shutting down due to a technical problem. The crew then advised their company that a generator would not come on line. An avionics technician carried out diagnosis during which both engines were ground-run twice. No fault was found and the flight crew requested taxi clearance at 17:10. A normal take off from runway 06 was carried out followed by a reduction to climb power at 1,200 feet amsl. At 2,200 feet amsl the aircraft anti-icing systems were selected on. Three seconds later the torque on each engine reduced rapidly to zero. A MAYDAY call was made by the crew advising that they had experienced a double engine failure. The aircraft was ditched in the Firth of Forth estuary some 100 meters from the shoreline near Granton Harbour.  Weather reported just before the accident with a temperature of +2Â°C, dewpoint of -3Â°C, visibility of more then 10 km, broken clouds at 4500 feet and cover at 8000 feet. CAUSAL FACTORS: 1) The operator did not have an established practical procedure for flight crews to fit engine intake blanks (ÂbungsÂ) in adverse weather conditions. This meant that the advice contained in the aircraft manufacturerÂs Maintenance Manual ÂFreezing weather-precautionsÂ was not complied with. Furthermore intake blanks were not provided on the aircraft nor were any readily available at Edinburgh Airport. 2) A significant amount of snow almost certainly entered into the engine air intakes as a result of the aircraft being parked heading directly into strong surface winds during conditions of light to moderate snowfall overnight. 3) The flow characteristics of the engine intake system most probably allowed large volumes of snow, ice or slush to accumulate in areas where it would not have been readily visible to the crew during a normal pre-flight inspection. 4) At some stage, probably after engine ground running began, the deposits of snow, ice or slush almost certainly migrated from the plenum chambers down to the region of the intake anti-ice vanes. Conditions in the intakes prior to takeoff are considered to have caused re-freezing of the contaminant, allowing a significant proportion to remain in a state which precluded its ingestion into the engines during taxi, takeoff and initial climb. 5) Movement of the intake anti-icing vanes, acting in conjunction with the presence of snow, ice or slush in the intake systems, altered the engine intake air flow conditions and resulted in the near simultaneous flameout of both engines. 6) The standard operating procedure of selecting both intake anti-ice vane switches simultaneously, rather than sequentially with a time interval, eliminated a valuable means of protection against a simultaneous double engine flameout.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: AAIB AAR 2/03 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) AAIB; near Granton Harbour; February 2001 photo (c) AAIB; near Granton Harbour; 28 February 2001 photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Glasgow International Airport (GLA); August 1999 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All of the passengers were members of a Virginia-based military construction and engineering crew on a routine training mission. The plane's pilot and two other crew members were members of the 171st Aviation Regiment of the Florida Army National Guard It appeared that the pilot's decision to go to the bathroom shifted the weight of the already unbalanced plane and caused it to become unstable and uncontrollable while in an area of strong turbulence. The nose of the plane slowly pitched up and then abruptly dropped just before the crash. In three seconds, the plane rose more than 100 feet with its nose down, and was then rocked by wind shear three times greater than what is defined as extreme turbulence. Within the first 12 seconds that they encountered problems, the G-force shifts rendered the crew and passengers incapacitated and unconscious and caused the breakup of the aircraft in flight. It was also established that the weather radar was underpowered, negatively impacting the ability of the crew to successfully circumnavigate around the severe weather. This C-23B Sherpa was originally built as a Shorts 360 (SH-3684) in December 1985 and was delivered to Simmons Airlines as N374MQ In 1998 the aircraft was converted to a Sherpa C-23B+. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The Collateral Investigation Board found the preponderance of the evidence concluded that the aircraft accident was due to crew error. The board found other factors present but not contributing directly to this aircraft accident. These factors may have influenced the crew's decision making process and aircraft performance. This is normally the case in most aircraft human factor accidents. The board did find the preponderance of the evidence directed the board toward the crew's failure to properly load the aircraft. In particular, the crew's failure to properly manage the weight and balance of the aircraft resulted in an 'out-of-CG' condition that exceeded the aircraft design limits, rendering the aircraft unstable and leading to a violent departure from controlled flight. Once the aircraft departed controlled flight, the rapid onset of significant G-force shifts rendered the crew and passengers incapacitated and unconscious and led to a structural break-up of the aircraft in flight. This ultimately resulted in the aircraft impacting the ground, killing all on board.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: USAF AIB Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Pete Whybrow  St. Petersburg Times   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

An engine examination and teardown determined that the #5 bearing assembly had failed.  Additional examination ascertained that the P2.5/P3 switching valve to rear inlet case sealing air tube had become disconnected, and the NL probe port sealing tube had melted, allowing an oil fed fire outside of the engine casing and into the engine compartment.  Investigation determined that the engine had not been placed on oil consumption and daily chip detector examination by company maintenance as required by the engine maintenance manual following a loss of oil event approximately 180 hours previous to the fire.  Additionally, the mandatory implementation of P&W service bulletin 20914, which addressed the P2.5/P3 switching valve to rear inlet case sealing air tube and NL probe port sealing tube was not carried out by the company, nor was it required, as the FAA airworthiness directive making the service bulletin mandatory did not include the PW120A engine.  The investigation also revealed that the company mandated implementation of P&W service bulletin 21446R3, was not carried out during an earlier hot section inspection and immediately preceding the earlier oil loss event. Probable Cause: The failure of the number 5 engine bearing assembly followed by the disconnection of the P2.5/P3 switching valve to rear inlet case sealing air tube and the melting of the NL probe port (sealing tube) which allowed an oil fed fire beyond the constraints of the engine casing and into the engine nacelle.  A contributing factor was the company's failure to follow several maintenance procedures within the maintenance manual after a previous oil loss event.  A second factor was the omission of the PW120A engine from the airworthiness directive issued by the FAA which mandated the completion of Pratt & Whitney service bulletin 20914.  The lack of inclusion of the PW120A engine in the AD resulted in the company's correct interpretation that the service bulletin was not mandatory.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: SEA01FA059 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB SEA01FA059  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates05-Apr-2024 11:45 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

The airplane did not touch down on the runway but the pilot initiated a go-around. With the next radio contact ten minutes later, the pilot reported to the TWR controller that his CitationJet had landing gear problems. During an arranged fly-by of the airplane by the tower, the controller confirmed that the undercarriage was down. Nevertheless the instruments did not show three greens. About 21:20, the aircraft touched down normally with the right-hand landing gear yielding immediately. By counteracting the airplane movement, the pilot managed in delaying ground contact of the right-hand wing and afterwards holding the CitationJet over a distance of 1000 m on the runway. Finally the airplane stopped 30 m to the right beside runway 15 and appr. 300 m in front of the intersection with runway 23. CONCLUSIONS: ""The cause of the accident was that: a) the hydraulic system failed as a result of a defective valve; b) the pilot did not accomplish the procedure recommended by the manufacturer in case the landing gear is not positively locked.

The ILS Runway 06 approach was in use.  Braking action advisories were in effect, and all surfaces were covered with thin wet snow.  During the approach to the airport, with the Second-in-Command (SIC) at the controls, the PIC visually observed that the hydraulic pressure gauge, ""smiley face,"" was normal, and he performed a ""brake test.""  The tower controller advised the flightcrew that a Navajo had just landed and reported a 250-foot ceiling, 3/4 miles of visibility, and that the runway braking action was ""good.""  On final approach, the airplane broke out of the overcast clouds about 400 feet above the ground.  The runway appeared dry, with only blowing snow across it.  As the airplane touched down about 1,463 feet beyond the approach end of the 4,677-foot long runway on the runway, the SIC stated that she did not have any braking effectiveness, and selected the ""dump flaps"" to slow the airplane.  The airplane continued down the runway and did not seem to be slowing to a safe speed.  The flightcrew observed the 1,000-foot marker approaching and the SIC selected the emergency brakes.  After she felt a lack of deceleration, the SIC selected the parking brake.  The airplane continued off the end of the runway, impacted a non-frangible fence, and came to rest with about 4 feet of the airplane protruding onto a public access road.  Examination of the airplane revealed a reference speed set on the pilot's airspeed indicator of 117 knots.  According to the Hawker Siddeley HS-125 Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) performance section, the uncorrected landing distance, on a dry runway, at the estimated landing weight of the airplane was approximately 2,610 feet.  The AFM performance section also had a chart for the ""Effect of Slippery Runway on Landing Distance.""  The chart determined that the ""equivalent scheduled landing distance available,"" was approximately 2,150 feet.  According to airport records, a NOTAM was issued the day of the accident, which referenced the condition of the runway surfaces as having ""Thin wet snow all surfaces.""  An air traffic controller observed slush ""spraying"" from the airplane, which extended 5 feet from the airplane, as the airplane rolled out.  The airplane's braking system was tested after the accident and no abnormalities were noted. Probable Cause: The pilot-in-commands inadequate preflight planning resulting in an approach to a runway with insufficient length.  A factor related to  the accident was the slush covered runway which resulted in a hydroplaning condition.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NYC01FA084 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB NYC01FA084  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates05-Apr-2024 11:39 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

The flight crew reported that at an airspeed of approximately 110 knots, the nose of the airplane began to lift off. The captain attempted to lower the nose, however, the airplane was unresponsive. The airplane became airborne and climbed to an altitude of 20 to 30 feet above the runway. The captain reduced the power on both engines and the airplane settled to the runway, striking the tail. The airplane traveled approximately 700 feet off the end of the runway where it came to rest in the muddy terrain. An emergency evacuation was performed during which the L2 evacuation slide did not deploy. During the investigation, NTSB determined that the airplane was loaded so that its center of gravity (CG), although within limits, was in the aft region of the permissible range. Further, the flight crew had incorrectly set the trim for the trimmable horizontal stabilizer (THS) at -1.7Â°UP (airplane nose up). This setting resulted in a pitch-up trim condition. The proper trim setting, 1.7Â°DN (airplane nose down), would have resulted in a correct trim condition for the way the airplane was loaded. The improperly set trim caused the nose of the airplane to lift off the runway prematurely. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The pilot induced oscillations and the delay in aborting the takeoff.

The airplane was being controlled by the autopilot at about 18,000 feet when they encountered instrument meteorological conditions that rapidly led to the windscreen being covered by a layer of ice. The crew turned ice protection systems on and the ice on the windshield was cleared. The first officer observed ice on the right wing's boots and the right prop's spinner that extended farther back than he had previously experienced. The first officer then switched the ice protection systems to their highest settings. De airspeed then decreased from 1750 to 160 kts. The captain disconnected the autopilot, applied power, and initiated nose down pitch inputs to arrest the airspeed loss. They indicated that these actions were unsuccessful and the speed further deteriorated to about 130 knots at which point the airplane rolled about 90 degrees to the left, and then back to near level. In the next 24 seconds, the airplane again rolled about 110 degrees to the left, back to level, then about 120 degrees to the right, back to level, and then rolled 360 degrees to the right, back to near wings level.

While on finals over the 'Col de la Tourmente', the aircraft was seen making a sharp turn to the left. The Twin Otter struck a house on the 'Col de la Tourmente' and caught fire. A man on the ground was also killed and his wife was injured. While on finals the captain probably  selected ""beta reverse range"" on the propellers in order to slow down. Upon vigorously pushing back the power levers to their normal position, an asymmetric power condition developed. The Twin Otter rolled to the left and crashed. Saint-BarthÃ©lÃ©my is known for the difficult approach to the airport and pilots flying into Saint-BarthÃ©lÃ©my need to have a special certification. After overflying 'Col de la Tourmente' a quick steep descent has to be made to land at runway 10, a 2100 feet runway which ends up in sea. The aircraft overfly the 'Col de la Tourmente' at a height of 10 m or less. PROBABLE CAUSES: ""The accident appears to result from the Captain's use of the propellers in the reverse beta range, to improve control of his track on short final. A strong thrust asymmetry at the moment when coming out of the reverse beta range would have caused the loss of yaw control, then roll control of the aircraft. The investigation could not exclude three other hypotheses which can nevertheless be classified as quite unlikely: - A loss of control during a go-around. - A loss of control due to a stall. - A loss of control due to sudden incapacitation of one of the pilots. The Captain's lack of recent experience on this airplane type, the undeniable difficulty of conducting an approach to runway 10 at Saint-BarthÃ©lemy and the pressure of time during this flight were contributory factors. The low height at which the loss of control occurred was an aggravating factor.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Report number: BEA F-ES010324 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   AP  BEA (Bureau Enquetes-Accidents)  Reuters   Location  Images: photo (c) Philippe MolÃ©; Saint-BarthÃ©lÃ©my Airport, Guadeloupe (SBH); March 2001 photo (c) Philippe MolÃ©; Saint-BarthÃ©lÃ©my Airport, Guadeloupe (SBH) photo (c) Philippe MolÃ©; Saint-BarthÃ©lÃ©my Airport, Guadeloupe (SBH) photo (c) Philippe MolÃ©; Saint-BarthÃ©lÃ©my Airport, Guadeloupe (SBH) photo (c) Philippe MolÃ©; Saint-BarthÃ©lÃ©my Airport, Guadeloupe (SBH) photo (c) Philippe MolÃ©; Saint-BarthÃ©lÃ©my Airport, Guadeloupe (SBH) photo (c) Philippe MolÃ©; Saint-BarthÃ©lÃ©my Airport, Guadeloupe (SBH) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

At 05:45, the aircraft departed Halifax for St. John's. The pilot flying was completing his line indoctrination training after having recently upgraded to captain. En route the crew were advised of a NOTAM that the ILS for runway 11 was unserviceable. Because of the marginal weather, the loss of runway 11/29, and his greater experience, the training captain decided to switch seats and assume the duties and full responsibilities as captain and pilot flying. Clearance for an ILS approach to runway 16 was obtained from Gander ACC, and the crew was advised to contact St. John's tower. Just over two minutes before landing, the tower advised that the wind was 050Â° (estimated) at 20, gusting to 35, knots. The aircraft crossed the final approach fix on the ILS glideslope at 150 KIAS. During the final approach, the airspeed steadily increased to 180 KIAS (ground speed 190 knots); the glidepath was maintained with a descent rate of 1000 feet per minute. From 1000 feet above sea level, no airspeed calls were made; altitude calls were made and responses were made. The Royal Boeing 737 operations manual states that the PNF shall call out significant deviations from programmed airspeed. In the descent, through 900 feet above sea level, the aircraft encountered turbulence resulting in uncommanded roll and pitch deviations and airspeed fluctuations of Â±11 knots. At about 300 feet above decision height, the crew acquired visual references for landing. They were cleared to land. The aircraft touched down at 164 KIAS (27 KIAS above the desired touchdown speed of Vref), 2300 to 2500 feet beyond the threshold. The wind at this point was determined to be about 050Â° at 30 knots. Shortly after touchdown, the speed brakes and thrust reversers were deployed. With approximately 1100 feet of runway remaining, through a speed of 64 KIAS, reverse thrust increased to about 1.97 EPR on engine 1 and 2.15 EPR on engine 2. As the aircraft approached the end of the runway, the captain attempted to steer the aircraft to the right, toward the Delta taxiway intersection. Twenty-two seconds after touchdown, the aircraft exited the departure end of the runway into deep snow. The aircraft came to rest approximately 75 feet beyond and 53 feet to the right of the runway centreline. The 737 has been stored at Saint John's since the accident. The aircraft sustained serious damage to the landing gear and the left engine detached from the wing. Royal Airlines was acquired by Canada 3000 later that year. The 737 has been stored at Saint John's since the accident. Royal Airlines was acquired by Canada 3000 later that year. Canada 3000 went bankrupt late 2001. FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: ""A combination of excessive landing speed, extended touchdown point, and low runway friction coefficient resulted in the aircraft overrunning the runway.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: TSB Report A01A0028 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) David Knudsen; Vancouver International Airport, BC (YVR); 15 April 2000 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Probable Cause: The flight dispatcher failure to provide the flight crew with current in-flight turbulence information that resulted in the in-flight encounter with turbulence during climb.  A factor was the pilots failure to obtain adequate weather information.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ATL01LA049 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB ATL01LA049 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates25-Mar-2024 11:20 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

The flight was an uneventful transit until the landing. The aerodrome was clearly visible and the commander made a visual approach in accordance to the aerodrome STAR charts. The approach was stabilized, despite the aircraft encountering a windshear at GELO. At 30 feet RA the commander noticed that the aircraft had developed a high sink rate and he attempted to decrease the rate of descent with full aft side stick but the aircraft landed heavily and bounced. At the second touch down the aircraft tail contacted the runway. The aircraft had suffered tail structural damage. There were no personal injuries Causes The investigation concluded that the marked backing of the wind, probably due to turbulence from the adjacent high ground, had caused the loss of headwind component. The application of full aft side stick had reduced the vertical speed of the initial touch down. In an attempt to cushion the second touch down by maintaining a degree of aft side stick during the bounce, the aircraft had continued to pitch up beyond the aircraft geometry limit causing the tail section to contact the runway.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: GPIAA Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 years and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: ICAO Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates18-Sep-2024 18:53 ASN Added 18-Sep-2024 19:24 ASN Updated [Aircraft type, Operator, Location, Nature, Departure airport, Destination airport, Narrative, Accident report, ]18-Sep-2024 19:25 ASN Updated [Location, Destination airport, ] Corrections or additions? ...

About 30 minutes before the turbulence was encountered, the company flight dispatcher communicated to the flight crew that the flight was approaching an area of forecast moderate to severe turbulence associated with mountain wave activity between FL310 and FL390 (39,000 feet).  The dispatcher recommended that the flight alter course and descend to FL280 (28,000 feet).  Eighteen minutes before the turbulence was encountered the pilot requested a ""ride report"" at FL310 from air traffic control and was told to expect ""occasional light chop, nothing real bad.""  The pilot remained at FL310 and remained on the existing routing.  Approaching the area of forecast turbulence, he illuminated the seat belt sign and advised the passengers of the potential for turbulence.  He also advised the flight attendants to stow the galley equipment.  Approximately 3 to 4 minutes later, the flight encountered turbulence.  The injured flight attendant was one of two in the aft galley.  The other flight attendant reported that when the turbulence started they were ""jolted"" a couple of times during which she recalled her feet came off the floor and then the turbulence subsided.  They ""scrambled"" toward their jumpseats; however, they encountered additional, more severe, turbulence and it became impossible to hold onto anything.  She recalled being thrown about the galley; hitting the ceiling, counters, and doors before being ""slammed"" to the floor.  When the turbulence ceased, the flight descended to flight level 280 and continued to its intended destination without further incident.  The airplane's digital flight data recorder showed the aircraft encountered three vertical acceleration excursions between 1.449 g's and -0.379 g's over a 16-second period.    Probable Cause: The failure of the pilot-in-command to properly evaluate a hazardous weather advisory and his failure to adequately alter course and flight altitude to avoid the area of hazardous weather.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: LAX01LA136 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB LAX01LA136 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  13 June 2016 N654AW American Airlines 0 Phoenix-Sky Harbor International Airport, AZ (PHX/KPHX) min Cowling loss Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates25-Mar-2024 11:20 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

Following the collision, the airplane continued down the runway with the tires smoking, veered off the right side of the runway near the end, crossed a taxiway, impacted into a ditch and burst into flames. After the accident, the captain and first officer both reported that the thrust reversers failed to operate after they were deployed during the landing. Examination of the landing gear found all three gear collapsed. The right and left main tires had areas of rubber that were worn completely through. The flaps were found extended, and both thrust reversers were found in the stowed position. Examination of the cockpit found the throttles in the idle position, and the thrust reverser levers in the stowed position. Aircraft performance calculations indicate that the airplane traveled 1,500 feet down the runway after touchdown, in 4.2 seconds, before striking the deer. The calculations also indicate that the airplane landed with a ground speed of 124 knots. At 124 knots and maximum braking applied, the airplane should have come to a complete stop in about 850 feet. However, investigation of the accident site and surrounding area revealed heavy black skid marks beginning at the first taxiway turnoff about 1,500 feet down the 5,010 foot runway. The skid marks continued for about 2,500 feet, departed the right side of the runway and proceeded an additional 500 feet over grass and dirt. The investigation revealed that deer fur was found lodged in the squat switch on the left main landing gear, likely rendering the squat switch inoperative after the impact with the deer, and prior to the airplaneÂs loss of control on the runway. Since a valid signal from the squat switch is required for thrust reverser deployment, the loss of this signal forced the thrust reversers to stow. At this point, the electronic engine control (EEC) likely switched to the forward thrust schedule and engine power increased to near takeoff power, which led to the airplane to continue down the runway, and off of it. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""On ground collision with deer during landing roll, and the inadvertent thrust reverser stowage caused by the damage to the landing gear squat switch by the collision, and subsequent application of forward thrust during rollout.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ATL01FA021 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight crew was cleared by 'Iceman' to taxi out of the de-icing bay via taxiway Tango and hold short of Mike. As the captain applied thrust to manoeuver the aircraft forward, the right wing of the B747 struck de-icing truck number thirteen tipping it over and injuring the driver, who was the sole occupant of the vehicle. The driver was taken to hospital with serious but non-life threatening injuries.  Findings as to causes and contributing factors 1. By passing the de-icing strip, the zone de-icing controller (ZDC) indicated to Iceman that the de-icing procedure was complete. In fact, beta truck 13 was still in position ahead of the aircraft's right wing. 2. On receipt of the de-icing strip, Iceman concluded that the de-icing equipment was clear and issued movement instructions to the flight crew of the aircraft while beta truck 13 was still in position ahead of the aircraft's right wing. 3. One ZDC was monitoring four active de-icing pads instead of the usual three pads. This increased activity resulted in task saturation and frequency congestion for the ZDC. 4. Because of the increased activity and the radio congestion, the driver/operator of beta truck 13 was unable to effectively establish radio communication with the ZDC to advise that he was still in position in front of the aircraft.

Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the pilotÂs spatial disorientation resulting from his failure to maintain positive manual control of the airplane with the available flight instrumentation.

The cargo consisted of a.o. 14 barrels with 55 gallons of gasoline each. The aircraft departed El Yopal at 13:45. While attempting to land at MitÃº, the landing gear struck the ground short of the threshold of runway 01. The crew carried out a go around and assessed the situation. The left hand main gear was broken away and a hydraulic leak caused control problems. By switching from the yellow to the blue hydraulic system, the crew were able to regain control. After flying over the control tower at MitÃº, they were informed by the controller of the loss of the left main left gear. The flight crew then declared an emergency and informed the tower controller at MitÃº that they would proceed to BogotÃ¡. The crew was not able to fully raise the flaps, so a decision was made to divert to El Yopal/ The plane climbed to 10000 feet and proceeded to El Yopal at this altitude. The crew then observed that the left engine oil pressure was dropping and the pilot proceeded to shut down the engine. In these conditions the plane began to lose height and speed. They then established contact with the control tower of El Yopal, informing the them of the emergency. It was decided to perform another flyby of the tower, which confirmed the left main hear had separated. The crew then agreed to burn fuel from the left wing tank to avoid a fire on that side during the emergency landing. The fuel indicators showed unreliable values and calculations were difficult since last part of the flight was performed under irregular circumstances. It was then decided to select the left fuel tank and continue to burn fuel until the low fuel warning appeared. The co-pilot recommended the captain to try to restart the left engine to have both reversers available on landing, but the request was rejected. Flying to the South-West of El Yopal Airport, the pilot ordered the co-pilot to move further away from the runway, while taking his cell phone to communicate with the Director of Operations of the airline. When the low fuel alarm went off, they selected the right tank, and the captain decided to return to land.  During the approach the right engine began to fail. The plane lost height quickly until it impacted the ground 4.9 miles from the threshold of runway 05. The aircraft caught fire after the impact and was completely destroyed. PROBABLE CAUSE FIRST IMPACT OF THE AIRCRAFT IN MITU. Low situational alert by the pilot in command in the final approach phase to land. SECOND IMPACT OF THE AIRCRAFT ON THE YOPAL. Failure of the crew to adequately plan for the foreseeable emergency. CONTRIBUTING FACTOR Passive attitude of the crew, especially by the Commander of the aircraft in handling critical situations. Inappropriate handling of CRM, poor or inadequate communication in the cockpit. Little experience in flight hours as a commander by the pilot in command of the aircraft. Little experience inz total flight hours and in the equipment on the part of the co-pilot.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Aerocivil Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: El Tiempo  ICAO Adrep   Location  Images: photo (c) Alex Waning; Villavicencio-La Vanguardia Airport (VVC); 06 May 2000 photo (c) via Andy Herzog; BogotÃ¡-Eldorado Airport (BOG/SKBO); January 1997 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft was cleared for the ILS/DME procedure for runway 28 and the crew requested the QFE which was 980 hPa. The decision height for the approach was 400 feet. At 1918:11 the crew reported that they were established on the localizer. When the aircraft intercepted the glidepath, the flaps were set to 15Â° correctly configuring the aircraft for the approach. The handling pilot recalled that initially the rate of descent was slightly higher than the expected 650 ft/min leading him to suspect the presence of a tailwind, however, the rate of descent returned to a more normal value when approximately 4 nm from the runway. The propellers were set to the maximum rpm at 1,200 feet agl. When the crew reported that they were inside 4 nm they were cleared to land and passed the surface wind, which was variable at 2 kt; they were also warned that the runway surface was wet. Both pilots saw the runway lights when approaching 400 feet agl; the flaps were selected to 30Â° and confirmed at that position. Both pilots believed that the airspeed was satisfactory but, as the commander checked back on the control column for the landing, the rate of descent increased noticeably and the aircraft landed firmly. Both pilots believed that the power levers were in the flight idle position and neither was aware of any unusual control inputs during the landing flare. The aircraft bounced before hitting the ground again, this time with the nose wheel first, before bouncing once more. The aircraft was then seen to travel about half way along the runway before slewing to the left and running onto the grass. When the aircraft stopped the left wing tip appeared to be touching the grass. CONCLUSION: ""Evidence from the CVR indicated that the flight was conducted in a thoroughly professional manner in accordance the operator's normal procedures until the final stages of the approach. The recorded data indicate that three seconds prior to touchdown the propeller blade angle changed from the flight range to the ground range. Coincident with this change the CVR recorded sounds consistent with the propellers 'disking' and the FDR indicated that the aircraft then decelerated longitudinally and accelerated downwards. The engineering investigation revealed that the propeller control rigging and the operation of the flight idle baulk were correct. Selection of ground fine requires the pilot to firstly release the flight idle baulk and then lift and pull the propeller levers further back, this combined action rapidly becomes a programmed motor skill in the routine of daily operations. It is therefore possible that the handling pilot unintentionally selected the propellers into the ground fine position whilst still in the air.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: AAIB Bulletin 10/2001 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Aviation Letter 417  Flight International 24-30 July 2001   Location  Images: photo (c) Steve Smith; Sheffield City Airport (SZD); 05 February 2001 photo (c) Steve Smith; Sheffield City Airport (SZD); 05 February 2001 photo (c) Joachim Bongers, via Werner Fischdick; Dublin Airport (DUB); September 2000 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The left main landing gear collapsed and the left wing, wing slats, and the No. 3 engine nacelle were damaged. Examination of the brake system found an electrical anomaly in one of two tacho-generators in the right main landing gear. Postaccident testing determined that the anomaly was not sufficient to affect brake performance. Analysis of cockpit voice recorder (CVR) information, weather data, and runway conditions indicated that the flight crew flew a straight-in global positioning system/non-directional beacon approach to runway 29.

The airplane pushed forward against the tow bar, sheared a pin, bent the tow bar, and struck the tug.  Before engine start, maintenance personnel had conducted an automated check which included automatic movements of the control wheel and throttles. The flight crew returned to their seats while the test was being conducted.   At the completion of the test, the airplane was returned to service and maintenance personnel departed the cockpit.  The captain initiated the BEFORE STARTING ENGINES checklist without either pilot first completing a cockpit flow setup as required by company procedures.  The checklist was then interrupted by a cockpit visitor and a non-pertinent conversation took place for 3 1/2 minutes. When the checklist was resumed, several items had been missed.  As the checklist was continued, the call out THRUST LEVERS was made by the first officer, and the correct response of CLOSED was given by the captain.  Push back was initiated, and the captain verbalized starting the first engine as required by the checklist.  As the first engine was being started, the captain initiated another non-pertinent conversation with the first officer.  The second engine was then started without verbalization as required by company checklist procedures.  Although company checklist procedures made both pilots responsible for ensuring a normal start, neither pilot detected that the engines were accelerating above normal idle.  According to follow-up testing, the engines accelerated to a power setting that corresponded to the last position of the throttles at the completion of the automated test by maintenance.

During their final ILS approach, the aircraft encountered heavy turbulence at about 200 feet agl. with gusts up to 65 mph. The aircraft encountered windshear with 1.25G updraft, downdraft and a tailwind gust at just 70 feet agl. When the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) sounded, the captain called for a go-around while pulling on the sidestick, reportedly without pressing his priority control button. The combination of dynamic winds and the crew actions created a situation that triggered the airplane's alpha protection system. As the crew applied TOGA power for a go-around, with both pilots pulling back on their sidesticks, the alpha protection law reduced the elevator nose-up command. Instead of a go- around, the aircraft struck the runway with a vertical speed of approx. 1,200 fpm. The nosegear collapsed and the aircraft skidded 3,280 feet (about 1000 m) down the runway before coming to a stop. CAUSES: ""The cause of the accident was the activation of the angle of attack protection system which, under a particular combination of vertical gusts and windshear and the simultaneous actions of both crew members on the sidesticks, not considered in the design, prevented the aeroplane from pitching up and flaring during the landing.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIA Report number: A-006/2001 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 years and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   Air Safety Week, Vol. 15, No. 25   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane, with two pilots and the chief technician of the operator on board, took off from runway 10 at 15:31. After five nautical miles the aircraft turned to the south. Less than three minutes after departure at an altitude of 5900 feet and an airspeed of 250 knots, the no. 1 engine failed. The captain decided to return to the airfield. Preparing for the approach to runway 10, the flaps were set at 8 degrees and the landing gear was extended. Because the aircraft was above the glideslope, power was reduced to idle and the flaps were lowered to 20 and a little later further down to 40 degrees. At that moment the airspeed dropped considerably. The thrust lever of the remaining right hand engine was then advanced to near takeoff power. Due to the asymmetric thrust the plane yawed to the left at a height of 200-300 feet. The captain ordered the first officer to raise the flaps back to the 20 degree position. The Learjet then stalled to the left, rolled inverted and crashed into trees. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The accident was caused by an in-flight failure of the left power plant appr. 3 minutes after take-off and an inadequate conduct of the subsequent single-engine land procedure so that in short final the airplane stalled and crashed from low height.

Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The flight was operating under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 121 as Great Lakes Flight 6798 and was on an active instrument flight plan. The captain and first officer (FO) reported no injuries. Eight passengers were released from the accident scene without treatment and seven passengers were transported to local area hospitals for evaluation and treatment of minor injuries. The flight originated at the Capital Airport, Springfield, Illinois at 1605. The crew unintentionally landed the airplane with the landing gear in the fully retracted position.  The crew did not lower the landing gear or check the landing gear position as required on the flaps-up landing checklist, the normal landing checklist, and final checklist.  According to the cockpit voice recorder (CVR), the landing gear unsafe warning horn did not sound during the entire recorded portion of the accident flight.  The minimum equipment list (MEL) requires the installation of a placard that prohibits the silencing of the landing gear warning horn when the flap system is inoperative.  The accident airplane had a placard that stated, ""Do not silence gear warning horn.""  No anomalies were found with the landing gear system including the landing gear unsafe warning horn, the red landing gear control handle lighting, and the landing gear position lights.  The flap system and ground proximity warning system (GPWS) were inoperative for the accident flight and were listed on the MEL as items that could be inoperative for revenue flight. Probable Cause: The flightcrew not lowering the landing gear and/or verifying the landing gear position as required by three separate checklists, which resulted in an inadvertent gear-up landing.  A factor to the accident was the flightcrew not complying with the required minimum equipment list placard that prohibited the silencing of the landing gear warning horn.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CHI01FA084 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  https://cdn.jetphotos.com/full/2/20473_1117105928.jpg (photo) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

According to the pilot he radioed ATC that he had the airport and runway in sight.   At 800 feet he lost sight of the runway because of ""light fog."" He performed a missed approach and stayed in the pattern VFR. On the second approach he was distracted by the fog, but said he did not lose sight of the runway.  He said that the co-pilot advised him to go around again but he landed.  He said the landing was hard, but did not realize he had a problem until the airplane started pulling to the left.  When the airplane came to a stop he got everyone out because of a fuel leak.  The 30-minute CVR recording was found to have no data that could contribute to determining the probable cause, and no transcript was prepared.  The reported visibility at the time of the accident was 0.25 sm mile with fog.  The pilot called the Saint Petersburg flight service station about 2 hours after the accident to report same. Probable Cause: the pilot misjudged the flare resulting in a hard landing, and impact with the runway.

The captain had the autopilot engaged as the airplane descended through 10,000 feet mean sea level.  The nose pitched down violently about 10 degrees, and then the nose pitched back up.  The captain disengaged the autopilot and hand flew the airplane to touchdown.  The Brasilia has two elevator trim actuators.  The manufacturer discovered moisture and corrosion in some of the actuators submitted for repair after similar occurrences.  They suspected that leaking seals allowed moisture into the actuators, which froze at altitude.  In numerous instances, the actuators functioned properly after descent to lower altitudes and warmer temperatures, where the units thawed.  One unit was dirty, corroded, and had overspray on it.  It leaked from the shaft seals and autoloc seal.  It failed the non-jamming stop test.  It's two shaft housings contained moisture.  The chain and pins were corroded, the packing had deteriorated, and the springs were weak.  One side of the rollers was not chamfered, and staking warped some screws.  The hub was worn and not functioning properly.  The second unit was dirty and had overspray on it.  The actuator leaked from the shaft seals.  The actuator had excessive backlash and failed the tangential free play test.  It's two shaft housings contained moisture.  The chain, pins, shafts, and housings were corroded.  The packing had deteriorated, and the bearings were rough and binding.  The rollers only had one chamfered side.  The shim was not with the unit.

After preparation for a Royal Mail charter flight 670A to Belfast, start clearance was given at 15:03. At 15:12Â hrs the crew advised ATC they were shutting down due to a technical problem. The crew then advised their company that a generator would not come on line. An avionics technician carried out diagnosis during which both engines were ground-run twice.

Weather reported just before the accident with a temperature of +2Â°C, dewpoint of -3Â°C, visibility of more then 10 km, broken clouds at 4500 feet and cover at 8000 feet. CAUSAL FACTORS: 1) The operator did not have an established practical procedure for flight crews to fit engine intake blanks (ÂbungsÂ) in adverse weather conditions. This meant that the advice contained in the aircraft manufacturerÂs Maintenance Manual ÂFreezing weather-precautionsÂ was not complied with. Furthermore intake blanks were not provided on the aircraft nor were any readily available at Edinburgh Airport. 2) A significant amount of snow almost certainly entered into the engine air intakes as a result of the aircraft being parked heading directly into strong surface winds during conditions of light to moderate snowfall overnight. 3) The flow characteristics of the engine intake system most probably allowed large volumes of snow, ice or slush to accumulate in areas where it would not have been readily visible to the crew during a normal pre-flight inspection. 4) At some stage, probably after engine ground running began, the deposits of snow, ice or slush almost certainly migrated from the plenum chambers down to the region of the intake anti-ice vanes. Conditions in the intakes prior to takeoff are considered to have caused re-freezing of the contaminant, allowing a significant proportion to remain in a state which precluded its ingestion into the engines during taxi, takeoff and initial climb. 5) Movement of the intake anti-icing vanes, acting in conjunction with the presence of snow, ice or slush in the intake systems, altered the engine intake air flow conditions and resulted in the near simultaneous flameout of both engines. 6) The standard operating procedure of selecting both intake anti-ice vane switches simultaneously, rather than sequentially with a time interval, eliminated a valuable means of protection against a simultaneous double engine flameout.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: AAIB AAR 2/03 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) AAIB; near Granton Harbour; February 2001 photo (c) AAIB; near Granton Harbour; 28 February 2001 photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Glasgow International Airport (GLA); August 1999 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All of the passengers were members of a Virginia-based military construction and engineering crew on a routine training mission. The plane's pilot and two other crew members were members of the 171st Aviation Regiment of the Florida Army National Guard It appeared that the pilot's decision to go to the bathroom shifted the weight of the already unbalanced plane and caused it to become unstable and uncontrollable while in an area of strong turbulence. The nose of the plane slowly pitched up and then abruptly dropped just before the crash. In three seconds, the plane rose more than 100 feet with its nose down, and was then rocked by wind shear three times greater than what is defined as extreme turbulence. Within the first 12 seconds that they encountered problems, the G-force shifts rendered the crew and passengers incapacitated and unconscious and caused the breakup of the aircraft in flight. It was also established that the weather radar was underpowered, negatively impacting the ability of the crew to successfully circumnavigate around the severe weather. This C-23B Sherpa was originally built as a Shorts 360 (SH-3684) in December 1985 and was delivered to Simmons Airlines as N374MQ In 1998 the aircraft was converted to a Sherpa C-23B+. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The Collateral Investigation Board found the preponderance of the evidence concluded that the aircraft accident was due to crew error. The board found other factors present but not contributing directly to this aircraft accident. These factors may have influenced the crew's decision making process and aircraft performance. This is normally the case in most aircraft human factor accidents. The board did find the preponderance of the evidence directed the board toward the crew's failure to properly load the aircraft. In particular, the crew's failure to properly manage the weight and balance of the aircraft resulted in an 'out-of-CG' condition that exceeded the aircraft design limits, rendering the aircraft unstable and leading to a violent departure from controlled flight. Once the aircraft departed controlled flight, the rapid onset of significant G-force shifts rendered the crew and passengers incapacitated and unconscious and led to a structural break-up of the aircraft in flight. This ultimately resulted in the aircraft impacting the ground, killing all on board.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: USAF AIB Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Pete Whybrow  St. Petersburg Times   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

An engine examination and teardown determined that the #5 bearing assembly had failed.  Additional examination ascertained that the P2.5/P3 switching valve to rear inlet case sealing air tube had become disconnected, and the NL probe port sealing tube had melted, allowing an oil fed fire outside of the engine casing and into the engine compartment.  Investigation determined that the engine had not been placed on oil consumption and daily chip detector examination by company maintenance as required by the engine maintenance manual following a loss of oil event approximately 180 hours previous to the fire.  Additionally, the mandatory implementation of P&W service bulletin 20914, which addressed the P2.5/P3 switching valve to rear inlet case sealing air tube and NL probe port sealing tube was not carried out by the company, nor was it required, as the FAA airworthiness directive making the service bulletin mandatory did not include the PW120A engine.  The investigation also revealed that the company mandated implementation of P&W service bulletin 21446R3, was not carried out during an earlier hot section inspection and immediately preceding the earlier oil loss event. Probable Cause: The failure of the number 5 engine bearing assembly followed by the disconnection of the P2.5/P3 switching valve to rear inlet case sealing air tube and the melting of the NL probe port (sealing tube) which allowed an oil fed fire beyond the constraints of the engine casing and into the engine nacelle.  A contributing factor was the company's failure to follow several maintenance procedures within the maintenance manual after a previous oil loss event.  A second factor was the omission of the PW120A engine from the airworthiness directive issued by the FAA which mandated the completion of Pratt & Whitney service bulletin 20914.  The lack of inclusion of the PW120A engine in the AD resulted in the company's correct interpretation that the service bulletin was not mandatory.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: SEA01FA059 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB SEA01FA059  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates05-Apr-2024 11:45 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

The ILS Runway 06 approach was in use.  Braking action advisories were in effect, and all surfaces were covered with thin wet snow.  During the approach to the airport, with the Second-in-Command (SIC) at the controls, the PIC visually observed that the hydraulic pressure gauge, ""smiley face,"" was normal, and he performed a ""brake test.""  The tower controller advised the flightcrew that a Navajo had just landed and reported a 250-foot ceiling, 3/4 miles of visibility, and that the runway braking action was ""good.""  On final approach, the airplane broke out of the overcast clouds about 400 feet above the ground.  The runway appeared dry, with only blowing snow across it.  As the airplane touched down about 1,463 feet beyond the approach end of the 4,677-foot long runway on the runway, the SIC stated that she did not have any braking effectiveness, and selected the ""dump flaps"" to slow the airplane.  The airplane continued down the runway and did not seem to be slowing to a safe speed.  The flightcrew observed the 1,000-foot marker approaching and the SIC selected the emergency brakes.  After she felt a lack of deceleration, the SIC selected the parking brake.  The airplane continued off the end of the runway, impacted a non-frangible fence, and came to rest with about 4 feet of the airplane protruding onto a public access road.  Examination of the airplane revealed a reference speed set on the pilot's airspeed indicator of 117 knots.  According to the Hawker Siddeley HS-125 Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) performance section, the uncorrected landing distance, on a dry runway, at the estimated landing weight of the airplane was approximately 2,610 feet.  The AFM performance section also had a chart for the ""Effect of Slippery Runway on Landing Distance.""  The chart determined that the ""equivalent scheduled landing distance available,"" was approximately 2,150 feet.  According to airport records, a NOTAM was issued the day of the accident, which referenced the condition of the runway surfaces as having ""Thin wet snow all surfaces.""  An air traffic controller observed slush ""spraying"" from the airplane, which extended 5 feet from the airplane, as the airplane rolled out.  The airplane's braking system was tested after the accident and no abnormalities were noted. Probable Cause: The pilot-in-commands inadequate preflight planning resulting in an approach to a runway with insufficient length.  A factor related to  the accident was the slush covered runway which resulted in a hydroplaning condition.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NYC01FA084 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB NYC01FA084  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates05-Apr-2024 11:39 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

The flight crew reported that at an airspeed of approximately 110 knots, the nose of the airplane began to lift off. The captain attempted to lower the nose, however, the airplane was unresponsive. The airplane became airborne and climbed to an altitude of 20 to 30 feet above the runway. The captain reduced the power on both engines and the airplane settled to the runway, striking the tail. The airplane traveled approximately 700 feet off the end of the runway where it came to rest in the muddy terrain. An emergency evacuation was performed during which the L2 evacuation slide did not deploy. During the investigation, NTSB determined that the airplane was loaded so that its center of gravity (CG), although within limits, was in the aft region of the permissible range. Further, the flight crew had incorrectly set the trim for the trimmable horizontal stabilizer (THS) at -1.7Â°UP (airplane nose up). This setting resulted in a pitch-up trim condition. The proper trim setting, 1.7Â°DN (airplane nose down), would have resulted in a correct trim condition for the way the airplane was loaded. The improperly set trim caused the nose of the airplane to lift off the runway prematurely. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The pilot induced oscillations and the delay in aborting the takeoff. Factors associated with the accident were the first officer used an improper trim setting and the captain did not identify and correct the setting during the taxi checklist, and the wet runway conditions.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CHI01FA104 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB id CHI01FA104   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane was being controlled by the autopilot at about 18,000 feet when they encountered instrument meteorological conditions that rapidly led to the windscreen being covered by a layer of ice. The crew turned ice protection systems on and the ice on the windshield was cleared. The first officer observed ice on the right wing's boots and the right prop's spinner that extended farther back than he had previously experienced. The first officer then switched the ice protection systems to their highest settings. De airspeed then decreased from 1750 to 160 kts. The captain disconnected the autopilot, applied power, and initiated nose down pitch inputs to arrest the airspeed loss. They indicated that these actions were unsuccessful and the speed further deteriorated to about 130 knots at which point the airplane rolled about 90 degrees to the left, and then back to near level. In the next 24 seconds, the airplane again rolled about 110 degrees to the left, back to level, then about 120 degrees to the right, back to level, and then rolled 360 degrees to the right, back to near wings level. Since the crew reported trouble with the flight attitude instruments, the roll angles recorded on the FDR are being further investigated. The maximum nose down pitch attitude was 60 degrees, the maximum recorded airspeed was about 240 kias, and maximum vertical acceleration during recovery was about +3.6 g. The crew immediately diverted to West Palm Beach and landed there 12 minutes after the upset.

While on finals over the 'Col de la Tourmente', the aircraft was seen making a sharp turn to the left. The Twin Otter struck a house on the 'Col de la Tourmente' and caught fire. A man on the ground was also killed and his wife was injured. While on finals the captain probably  selected ""beta reverse range"" on the propellers in order to slow down. Upon vigorously pushing back the power levers to their normal position, an asymmetric power condition developed. The Twin Otter rolled to the left and crashed. Saint-BarthÃ©lÃ©my is known for the difficult approach to the airport and pilots flying into Saint-BarthÃ©lÃ©my need to have a special certification. After overflying 'Col de la Tourmente' a quick steep descent has to be made to land at runway 10, a 2100 feet runway which ends up in sea. The aircraft overfly the 'Col de la Tourmente' at a height of 10 m or less. PROBABLE CAUSES: ""The accident appears to result from the Captain's use of the propellers in the reverse beta range, to improve control of his track on short final. A strong thrust asymmetry at the moment when coming out of the reverse beta range would have caused the loss of yaw control, then roll control of the aircraft. The investigation could not exclude three other hypotheses which can nevertheless be classified as quite unlikely: - A loss of control during a go-around. - A loss of control due to a stall. - A loss of control due to sudden incapacitation of one of the pilots. The Captain's lack of recent experience on this airplane type, the undeniable difficulty of conducting an approach to runway 10 at Saint-BarthÃ©lemy and the pressure of time during this flight were contributory factors. The low height at which the loss of control occurred was an aggravating factor.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Report number: BEA F-ES010324 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   AP  BEA (Bureau Enquetes-Accidents)  Reuters   Location  Images: photo (c) Philippe MolÃ©; Saint-BarthÃ©lÃ©my Airport, Guadeloupe (SBH); March 2001 photo (c) Philippe MolÃ©; Saint-BarthÃ©lÃ©my Airport, Guadeloupe (SBH) photo (c) Philippe MolÃ©; Saint-BarthÃ©lÃ©my Airport, Guadeloupe (SBH) photo (c) Philippe MolÃ©; Saint-BarthÃ©lÃ©my Airport, Guadeloupe (SBH) photo (c) Philippe MolÃ©; Saint-BarthÃ©lÃ©my Airport, Guadeloupe (SBH) photo (c) Philippe MolÃ©; Saint-BarthÃ©lÃ©my Airport, Guadeloupe (SBH) photo (c) Philippe MolÃ©; Saint-BarthÃ©lÃ©my Airport, Guadeloupe (SBH) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

At 05:45, the aircraft departed Halifax for St. John's. The pilot flying was completing his line indoctrination training after having recently upgraded to captain. En route the crew were advised of a NOTAM that the ILS for runway 11 was unserviceable. Because of the marginal weather, the loss of runway 11/29, and his greater experience, the training captain decided to switch seats and assume the duties and full responsibilities as captain and pilot flying. Clearance for an ILS approach to runway 16 was obtained from Gander ACC, and the crew was advised to contact St. John's tower. Just over two minutes before landing, the tower advised that the wind was 050Â° (estimated) at 20, gusting to 35, knots. The aircraft crossed the final approach fix on the ILS glideslope at 150 KIAS. During the final approach, the airspeed steadily increased to 180 KIAS (ground speed 190 knots); the glidepath was maintained with a descent rate of 1000 feet per minute. From 1000 feet above sea level, no airspeed calls were made; altitude calls were made and responses were made. The Royal Boeing 737 operations manual states that the PNF shall call out significant deviations from programmed airspeed. In the descent, through 900 feet above sea level, the aircraft encountered turbulence resulting in uncommanded roll and pitch deviations and airspeed fluctuations of Â±11 knots. At about 300 feet above decision height, the crew acquired visual references for landing. They were cleared to land. The aircraft touched down at 164 KIAS (27 KIAS above the desired touchdown speed of Vref), 2300 to 2500 feet beyond the threshold. The wind at this point was determined to be about 050Â° at 30 knots. Shortly after touchdown, the speed brakes and thrust reversers were deployed. With approximately 1100 feet of runway remaining, through a speed of 64 KIAS, reverse thrust increased to about 1.97 EPR on engine 1 and 2.15 EPR on engine 2. As the aircraft approached the end of the runway, the captain attempted to steer the aircraft to the right, toward the Delta taxiway intersection. Twenty-two seconds after touchdown, the aircraft exited the departure end of the runway into deep snow. The aircraft came to rest approximately 75 feet beyond and 53 feet to the right of the runway centreline. The 737 has been stored at Saint John's since the accident. The aircraft sustained serious damage to the landing gear and the left engine detached from the wing. Royal Airlines was acquired by Canada 3000 later that year. The 737 has been stored at Saint John's since the accident. Royal Airlines was acquired by Canada 3000 later that year. Canada 3000 went bankrupt late 2001. FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: ""A combination of excessive landing speed, extended touchdown point, and low runway friction coefficient resulted in the aircraft overrunning the runway.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: TSB Report A01A0028 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) David Knudsen; Vancouver International Airport, BC (YVR); 15 April 2000 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight was an uneventful transit until the landing. The aerodrome was clearly visible and the commander made a visual approach in accordance to the aerodrome STAR charts. The approach was stabilized, despite the aircraft encountering a windshear at GELO. At 30 feet RA the commander noticed that the aircraft had developed a high sink rate and he attempted to decrease the rate of descent with full aft side stick but the aircraft landed heavily and bounced. At the second touch down the aircraft tail contacted the runway. The aircraft had suffered tail structural damage. There were no personal injuries Causes The investigation concluded that the marked backing of the wind, probably due to turbulence from the adjacent high ground, had caused the loss of headwind component. The application of full aft side stick had reduced the vertical speed of the initial touch down. In an attempt to cushion the second touch down by maintaining a degree of aft side stick during the bounce, the aircraft had continued to pitch up beyond the aircraft geometry limit causing the tail section to contact the runway.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: GPIAA Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 years and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: ICAO Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates18-Sep-2024 18:53 ASN Added 18-Sep-2024 19:24 ASN Updated [Aircraft type, Operator, Location, Nature, Departure airport, Destination airport, Narrative, Accident report, ]18-Sep-2024 19:25 ASN Updated [Location, Destination airport, ] Corrections or additions? ...

About 30 minutes before the turbulence was encountered, the company flight dispatcher communicated to the flight crew that the flight was approaching an area of forecast moderate to severe turbulence associated with mountain wave activity between FL310 and FL390 (39,000 feet).  The dispatcher recommended that the flight alter course and descend to FL280 (28,000 feet).  Eighteen minutes before the turbulence was encountered the pilot requested a ""ride report"" at FL310 from air traffic control and was told to expect ""occasional light chop, nothing real bad.""  The pilot remained at FL310 and remained on the existing routing.  Approaching the area of forecast turbulence, he illuminated the seat belt sign and advised the passengers of the potential for turbulence.  He also advised the flight attendants to stow the galley equipment.  Approximately 3 to 4 minutes later, the flight encountered turbulence.  The injured flight attendant was one of two in the aft galley.  The other flight attendant reported that when the turbulence started they were ""jolted"" a couple of times during which she recalled her feet came off the floor and then the turbulence subsided.  They ""scrambled"" toward their jumpseats; however, they encountered additional, more severe, turbulence and it became impossible to hold onto anything.  She recalled being thrown about the galley; hitting the ceiling, counters, and doors before being ""slammed"" to the floor.  When the turbulence ceased, the flight descended to flight level 280 and continued to its intended destination without further incident.  The airplane's digital flight data recorder showed the aircraft encountered three vertical acceleration excursions between 1.449 g's and -0.379 g's over a 16-second period.    Probable Cause: The failure of the pilot-in-command to properly evaluate a hazardous weather advisory and his failure to adequately alter course and flight altitude to avoid the area of hazardous weather.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: LAX01LA136 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB LAX01LA136 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  13 June 2016 N654AW American Airlines 0 Phoenix-Sky Harbor International Airport, AZ (PHX/KPHX) min Cowling loss Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates25-Mar-2024 11:20 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

The flight crew was advised of a heading to fly which led the airplane into a cloud that was not depicted on the weather avoidance radar.  ""In this cloud we encountered moderate to severe turbulence....""  According to the American Eagle Safety/Flight Service Trip Report (FSTR) which is an attachment to this report, ""[flight attendant] Alvarez was finishing her beverage service and they hit turbulence.  She flew into the air twice and cart came down on her right leg.  She was on her way to the galley to stow cart.""  The captain also reported that the autopilot which was on at the time, did not disengage.  A passenger who is an emergency medical technician (EMT), attended to the passenger and was assisted initially by the first officer.  A medical emergency was declared and the flight continued to the destination airport and landed uneventfully.  The first report to ATC occurred at 1448 local, when, while approaching the JUNUR intersection, a flightcrew member declared a medical emergency and advised the controller that the flight had encountered turbulence 50 miles back. Probable Cause: The in-flight encounter with moderate to severe turbulence in clouds resulting in the serious injury to the flight attendant.  A contributing factor in the accident was the poor in-flight planning by the captain for his allowing beverage service to continue after being advised by ATC of an area of turbulence that was approximately 4 minutes ahead of their position.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: MIA01LA131 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB MIA01LA131 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates25-Mar-2024 11:19 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

The flight was cleared to taxi at 12:01 hrs. The captain was pilot-non-flying and was seated in the right cockpit seat. During taxi, the crew completed their normal Before Takeoff Checks; these included confirmation that the control checks had been completed and that anti-ice might be required immediately after takeoff. Flap 20 had been selected for takeoff and the following speeds had been calculated and briefed by the pilots: V1 137 kt; VR 140 kt; V2 147 kt. By 12:06, the aircraft was cleared to line up on runway 15. At 12:07 hrs, N90AG was cleared for takeoff with a surface wind of 140Â°/8 kt. Takeoff appeared normal up to lift-off. Rotation was started at about 146 kt. Lift-off occurred 2 seconds later, at about 153 kt and with a pitch attitude of about 8 degrees nose-up. Immediately after lift-off, the aircraft started to bank to the left. The rate of bank increased rapidly and 2 seconds after lift-off the bank angle had reached 50 degrees. At that point, the aircraft heading had diverged about 10 degrees to the left. Opposite aileron, followed closely by right rudder, was applied as the aircraft started banking; full right aileron and full right rudder had been applied within 1 second and were maintained. As the bank angle continued to increase, progressively more aircraft nose-up elevator was applied. Stick-shaker operation initiated 3.5 seconds after lift-off. The left winglet contacted the runway shoulder, the outboard part of the left wing detached and the aircraft struck the ground inverted, structurally separating the forward fuselage. Fuel released from ruptured tanks ignited and the wreckage slid to a halt on fire. The last recorded aircraft attitude was approximately 111 degrees left bank and 13 degrees nose-down pitch. CAUSAL FACTORS: ""1. The crew did not ensure that N90AG's wings were clear of frost prior to takeoff.;  2. Reduction of the wing stall angle of attack, due to the surface roughness associated with frost contamination, to below that at which the stall protection system was effective.; 3. Possible impairment of crew performance by the combined effects of a non-prescription drug, jet-lag and fatigue.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: AAIB AAR 5-2004 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) aeroprints.com; Rantoul, KS; 30 April 2013; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane was prepared for the continuing flight to Batam. At 10:05 the First Officer asked for start clearance and received weather information. The weather was fine, wind calm and clear. After start-up was completed, the aircraft taxied to runway 18. The crew decided to use 'reduced take off power' with an assumed temperature of 35 deg. C, while the actual temperature was 27 deg. C. The First Officer acted as Pilot Flying. After being cleared for takeoff, the captain advanced the throttles and adjusted them to the required take off power setting. He then called the V1 and VR speeds and the First Officer pulled the control column to a 15 deg. nose up pitch. The aircraftÂs nose lifted up, but the aircraft did not become airborne. The stick shaker activated. The captain then added power and the speed increased to V2+15 (approx. 158 KIAS) but the aircraft still did not get airborne. The captain then decided to abort . He called 'stop', retarded the power levers to idle, applied reverse thrust, extended the speed brake and applied brakes. The nose of the aircraft touched down hard, causing the front left door (L1) to open and two trolleys at front galley to move forward, blocking the cockpit door. The flight crew turned the aircraft slightly to the right to avoid approach lights ahead. It hit some trees and stopped at approx. 275 meters from the end of runway.

The aircraft climbed to its assigned cruising altitude of FL220, which was reached at 06:53. Permission to descend was given at 07:12 and at 07:23 the crew started an ILS approach to runway 30. Two minutes later the captain experienced control problems, which he attributed to an autopilot malfunction. An increase in the rate of descent went unnoticed by the crew who tried to find out the cause of the control problems. As the plane was descending over mountainous terrain, the GPWS alarm sounded three times. The approach controller then asked if the flight was established on the localizer and ILS glidepath. The copilot then replied that they had captured the localizer. Approach Control then instructed the crew to contact Bilbao Tower. Contact was not established however. The copilot noticed that they had not captured the glidepath and informed the captain. The airplaneÂ´s speed and rate of descent were reduced and a smooth climb was initiated. Six seconds later the airplane flew into the side of the Monte de Santa Marina, some 18 nm (33 km) from Bilbao Airport. The mountain has an altitude of 675 m (2215 ft).

During the initial descent the crew decided to deviate from the planned route because of thunderstorms along their planned route. At 16:19 the flight encountered an area of severe turbulence and thunderstorm activity with extremely heavy precipitation and hail. The crew attempted to fly towards a gap between two storm cells. About 90 seconds after entering the thunderstorm, as the airplane descended through about FL180 at a flight idle power setting, both engines flamed out. The crew carried out three unsuccessful attempts to restart the engines followed by one unsuccessful attempt to start the auxiliary power unit (APU). The flight crewÂs reported actions to restart the engines and APU however, were contrary to the procedures contained in the Boeing 737 Operations Manual. For instance, they waited only about 1 minute between each restart attempt instead of three minutes.  As the airplane descended below an overcast cloud layer at about 8,000 feet, the crew observed the Bengawan Solo River and decided to attempt to ditch the airplane into the river with flaps and landing gear in a shallow, 1 metre deep part of the river. One stewardess did not survive the crash.  Similar occurrences (Boeing 737-300 double engine flameout while descending in heavy precipitation with engines at flight idle) happened May 24, 1988 and July 26, 1988. Following these incidents OMB 88-5 and AD 6-14-88 were issued to require minimum rpm of 45% and to restrict the use of autothrust in moderate/heavy precipitation; engine modification was provided for increased capacity of water ingestion. Probable Cause: ""The NTSC determines that the probable causes of the accident were the combination of 1) The aircraft had entered severe hail and rain during weather avoidance which subsequently caused both engines flame out; 2) Two attempts of engine-relight failed because the aircraft was still in the precipitation beyond the enginesÂ certified capabilities; and 3) During the second attempt relight, the aircraft suffered run-out electrical power.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSC Report number: KNKT/02.02/06.01.33 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: Flight International  Jakarta Post  NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSC; near Yokyakarta; 16 January 2002 photo (c) NTSC; near Yokyakarta; 16 January 2002 photo (c) NTSC; near Yokyakarta; 16 January 2002 photo (c) Andy Martin; Jakarta-Soekarno-Hatta International Airport (CGK/WIII); 24 March 1990 photo (c) Alan Tsui; Singapore-Changi International Airport (SIN/WSSS); 04 April 1999 photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Denpasar-Ngurah Rai Bali International Airport (DPS/WADD); 03 April 1991 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The Tower controller reported that runway 23 was in use and that the weather included a 6 knot wind at 020 degrees, temperature 29 degrees. The crew were then to have turned from 064 to 094 degrees, direct to Lago Agrio. They failed to do so and continued their present heading.

There were no injuries.  The flight was destined for Atlanta, Georgia. According to the captain, the ramp was covered with snow and ice, and their gate position required a pushback with a nose swing of about 120 degrees. The airplane had an inoperative APU, and he elected to start both engines at the gate prior to pushback because a single engine crossbleed start would require an N1 of 80 percent on the operative engine. After both engines were started, the pushback was initiated. As the tug neared a 90 degree position to the right side of the nose of the airplane, it started to move forward, and then stopped when it struck the tug, after which the captain set the brakes. The captain added that he had not applied the brakes until after the airplane came to rest.  The tug driver reported that he had already pushed back two airplanes that morning with no problems, and that the initial part of the push was without incident. As the airplane entered an area where the ramp was icy, he turned the nose of the airplane to the west. The nosewheels on the airplane started slipping, and he was unable to communicate this to the cockpit crew. He stopped the tug and the airplane slid into the tug. Damage to the airplane consisted of a hole in the right side of the fuselage, located about 3 feet below the bottom of the forward, right side cabin door, and about 4 feet behind the trailing edge of the door. Internally, there was damage to the longerons. The lack of direction from the operator on how to perform pushbacks on an icy ramp, which led to the tug driver positioning the tug at an angle to the nose of the airplane that allowed the airplane to move forward and strike the tug. Factors were the inadequate visual lookout by the walker wearing the headset, and the icy ramp.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NYC02LA056 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  3 May 1972 TC-JAB TÃ¼rk Hava Yollari - THY 0 Sofia unk Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were 87 passengers and six crew members on board. Three cabin attendants sustained minor injuries. All Nippon Airways flight 391 took off from Nagoya Airport (NGO) at 11:53 on a regular domestic flight to Hakodate. After beginning descent from cruise altitude, the aircraft was radar vectored onto the final approach course by the Hakodate Approach Control, and commenced an ILS runway 12 approach at Hakodate Airport. During the approach, the captain assumed the duties of Pilot Not Flying (PNF) while the first officer assumed Pilot Flying (PF) duties. The aircraft encountered light turbulence during the approach. Hakodate Airport Tower reported the wind for runway 12 as 130Â°/28 kt, a strong and slightly right crosswind. Although the approach course and flight path angle of aircraft were both normal during the approach, the aircraftÂs wind shear warning system issued an aural wind shear warning at around 140 m from the runway threshold, at an altitude of 53 ft above ground level (AGL) while the aircraft was flying over the approach lights for runway 12. Although the crew initiated a go-around to recover from the wind shear, the aircraftÂs aft fuselage contacted the runway and as a result substantial damage was sustained. The aircraft continued to go around for recovery from the wind shear after contacted aft fuselage with the runway. The crew made another ILS approach to runway 12, and landed at Hakodate Airport at around 13:21 uneventfully. An external check after arrival found that damage had been sustained to the lower surface of the aft fuselage. PROBABLE CAUSES In this accident, it is estimated that while on final approach at a height of approximately 100ft AGL, the aircraft encountered severe wind shear and although recovery actions were taken, a sufficient rate of ascent was not attained in time to prevent the lower surface of the aft fuselage striking the runway, resulting in damage to rear frames and the aft pressure bulkhead. Further, the following factors are considered to have contributed to this accident: (1) A delay in engine thrust response to the thrust levers being advanced to recover from the wind shear, combined with a reduced approach speed, meant that an increase in speed could not be obtained immediately. These factors contributed to the fact that sufficient rate of ascent could not be attained in time to prevent the tail strike. (2) Factors contributing to the reduced approach speed were the fact that the first officer, acting as PF, had selected a slightly low value for the final approach speed, and that he reduced thrust in response to an increase in headwind. (3) Factors in the reduction of engine thrust in response to the increase in headwind were because the pilot was operating the thrust levers manually in ""SELECTED SPEED"" mode he was attempting to maintain a constant CAS, and that the flight crew had not adequately anticipated a increasing followed by a continuing drop in wind speed. (4) Regarding the selection of a slightly low value for final approach speed, appropriate consideration was not given to wind speed, and there were concerns over touch down attitude related to high approach speeds. (5) Regarding the fact that appropriate consideration was not given to wind speed, the first officer used a simple calculation formula that did not separately consider the additional airspeed margins to take account of wind speed changes and the head wind component, but that treated these together. (6) Regarding the concerns over aircraft touch down attitude at high approach speeds, the measures described in the operatorÂs AOM for dealing with a nose-down attitude assumed only the case of full flap landings, and the First Officer considered difficulty to land an aircraft with a nose-down attitude. It is considered possible that the low-level wind shear had originated due the effects of ground topography on the surface boundary layer under conditions of strong winds accompanied by gusts.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ARAIC Report number: 2003-5 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ  History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  30 March 2008 AP-BRJ Airblue 0 Lahore, min Images: photo (c) JTSB; Hakodate Airport (HKD/RJCH); January 2002 photo (c) isamuel; Akita Airport (AXT/RJSK); 09 October 2004 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane was positioned near the end of the runway with the engines shut down during an air traffic control delay.   After approximately 15 minutes, the flightcrew was informed by ground control that they should start their engines, as they would probably be released for takeoff soon.  The captain reported they were unable to start the right engine.  They performed the ""clearing procedure"" and then went on to start the left engine with no problem.  They then attempted to start the right engine again.    Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) personnel were parked near the airplane reported to air traffic control that there were smoke and flames coming from the right engine.  There were no fire warning indications in the cockpit.  The flightcrew performed the ENGINE FIRE checklist and subsequently discharged both fire suppressant bottles into the engine.  The flightcrew eventually shut down both engines and ARFF requested that the flightcrew begin evacuating the airplane.   All of the passengers were directed to the front of the airplane and the evacuation took place using the 1L and 1R doors.  A witness reported that the injured passenger stepped out of the airplane onto the slide.  The passenger bounced down the slide and went over the side of the slide approximately four to five feet above the ground.  The investigation revealed the engine start fuel scheduling for the Fuel Control Unit was high.  In addition, the ignition exciter box and igniter plugs were tested.  The ignition exciter box was found to operate intermittently on the D.C. circuit which would be used for engine start. Probable Cause: The passenger fell off the side of the slide during the emergency evacuation.  Factors were the emergency evacuation and the erratic ignition exciter.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CHI02LA069 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB CHI02LA069  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates25-Mar-2024 10:54 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

TAME Flight 120 was a scheduled flight from Quito to Cali, Colombia via TulcÃ¡n. The Boeing 727 took off from runway 17 at 10:03 for the first leg to TulcÃ¡n. The flight climbed to the cruising altitude of FL180 and proceeded on the G-675 airway towards Ipiales from where it was to turn to TulcÃ¡n. At 10:15 the flight contacted TulcÃ¡n Tower. At that moment the airplane was 29 miles from the TulcÃ¡n NDB. The crew received permission to descend to FL140 and was given the current weather information, which included 8000 metres visibility, few clouds at 200 metres and overcast at 500 metres. The approach procedure called for a speed of 180 kts, but the actual speed was much higher at 230 knots. During the descent the airplane flew into the side of the Nevado el Cumbal Volcano at 14,700 feet, 1400 feet below the summit. PROBABLE CAUSE (translated from Spanish): 1) The decision of the instructor captain and his crew to initiate and continue the operation towards Tulcan airport below the meteorological minima established in the company's SOPs.  2) Inadequate navigation and operation of the aircraft by the pilot flying and directed by the instructor captain, consisting of entering the holding pattern of the Tulcan radio beacon with a speed of 230 knots indicated airspeed and with a banking of 15 degrees exceeding the maximum stipulated speed limit of 180 knots  during the entire procedure including the holding pattern and using a banking below the recommended range of 25 to 30 degrees, thus exceeding the lateral navigation and obstacle protection limits of the holding pattern, leading this operation to the collision with El Cumbal Hill.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Aerocivil Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: El Universo   Location  Images: photo (c) Jesper Venema photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Quito-Mariscal Sucre Airport (UIO/SEQU) [HC]; 06 January 2000 photo (c) Ariel Corridor; Quito-Mariscal Sucre Airport (UIO/SEQU); 15 August 1991 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates02-Jan-2025 09:00 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Shortly before impact, the mishap crew was conducting a simulated single-engine approach to runway 31 at Ellsworth AFB. Subsequent analysis showed that there was a significantly greater amount of fuel in the left wing and left wing tip tank than the right. The gross fuel imbalance resulted from an unmonitored transfer of fuel from the right wing and right wing tip tank to the left that was initiated by the crew approximately nine and one-half minutes before impact. As the aircraft approached the point when it would normally transition to a flare, it leveled off and began a climbing turn to the west, toward the tower. It did not touch down prior to the turn, but veered left immediately during the flare, and then rolled back to wings level momentarily as it climbed. The heavier left wing, and application of power to the right engine for the go-around, caused the aircraft to roll back into a steeper left turn, stayed in a climbing left turn with the bank continuing to increase until il rolled through more than 90 degrees of bank. As the aircraft reached the highest point of the climb (approximately 450 feet), the bank angle was more than 90 degrees, and perhaps slightly inverted as the nose dropped and the aircraft began to descend. The aircraft impacted the ground in a grassy field. The accident investigation board president found clear and convincing evidence that the primary cause of the mishap was the crew's failure to follow flight manual procedures for fuel transfer. As a result, the mishap aircraft experienced a fuel imbalance significant enough to cause the aircraft to enter an unsafe roll to the left from which the pilot was not able to recover.Sources: US Department of Defense  USAAS-USAAC-USAAF-USAF Aircraft Serial Numbers--1908 to Present / Joe Baugher   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

The airplane was on jacks, for a tire change, when a mechanic needed access to the airplane's Maintenance Data Acquisition Unit (MDAU) to check out the problem that the airplane was having regarding false over speed warnings. Since the airplane was on jacks the mechanic had to disable the weight-on-wheel (WOW) switches in order to simulate that the WOW was in the ground mode, not in the air mode, and to gain access to the MDAU. The mechanic said he used a ""Popsicle stick"" to disable these switches. After the maintenance was completed the sticks were not removed, and the inspector that returned the airplane to service was not aware that the WOW switches had been disabled for any reason and no notation was mentioned in the work logs.  The aircraft was to be ferried back to Teterboro and shortly after takeoff the landing gear failed to retract. Despite several attempts the crew did not succeed in raising the gear. They elected to land, to evaluate the situation on the ground, and performed an ILS approach back to runway 27R. Shortly before touchdown the power levers were retarded to idle. At that point the spoilers deployed and the aircraft suddenly and abruptly descended to the runway with a very hard, 4.25 g, landing. The right main gear was pushed through the wing causing spilling of fuel on the runway. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""Maintenance personnel's failure to remove wooden sticks from the landing gear weight-on-wheel switches resulting in the airplane remaining in ground mode, and the in flight deployment of the spoilers when the flight crew moved the power levers to idle, during the landing flare, resulting in a hard landing.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: MIA02LA060 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 years and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

After departure, at an altitude of 15,000 feet, the flight was operating in and out of clouds.  The pilot reported that he was not receiving any significant weather radar returns ahead of the airplane.  However, as he cleared a layer of clouds, he observed a cumulus cloud that was ahead of the airplane.  The cloud was too close to avoid and he flew through the top of the cloud.  While in the cloud, the airplane encountered turbulence which threw a flight attendant located in the rear of the airplane into the air, and he subsequently fell and fractured his ankle.  The captain had briefed the crew prior to departure, but did not include any specific comments about delaying the start of cabin service until clear of the thunderstorms, nor was he specifically required to.  The airline had no written direction for the flight attendants to know when they could leave their seats and begin cabin service. Probable Cause and Findings An inadvertent encounter with convective induced turbulence, which injured a flight attendant. Factors were the failure of the airline to supply direction to the flight crew to indicate when the flight attendants could begin cabin service, and the convective induced turbulence.

The runway controller at Changi Tower instructed the aircraft to park at Bay 117, a remote aircraft parking bay. The ground movement planner at Changi Tower selected the taxiway centre line lights to guide the aircraft along Taxiway WA to Bay C7 (Bay 117 is the second parking bay after Bay C7). Instead of stopping at the end of its assigned taxi route, the aircraft continued taxiing past Bay C7 along a diverted portion of Taxiway WA. At about 00:37 hours, the aircraft called Changi Tower to indicate its position near Bay 106. Realising that the aircraft had missed its assigned parking position, the ground movement planner at Changi Tower reselected the taxiway centre line lights to guide the aircraft back to Bay 117. The aircraft followed the return route until it was abeam Bay 117 on the straight section of the diverted portion of Taxiway WA. At that location, the pilot saw the ground marshaller in position at Bay 117 on the aircraftÂs right side. Instead of continuing to follow the taxiway centre line lights on the assigned taxi route, the aircraft turned right. In doing so, it left the Taxiway WA centre line and went onto a grass area between Taxiway WA and the parking apron. The nose gear of the aircraft went across a drain within the grass area. The aircraft came to a halt when its main landing gears went into the drain at about 00:44 hours. Contributory Factors - The runway controller was not aware of the requirement for aircraft to be towed into Bay 117. He instructed flight APWP6L to follow the green lights to Bay 117 in accordance with standard ATC procedures. -  The flight crew did not notice on the Jeppesen charts that there was a turf island separating Taxiway WA from the parking apron where Bay 117 was located.  - As taxiway centre line lights were provided along Taxiway WA, according to ICAO Annex 14, there was no requirement for taxiway edge lights to be provided. However, where there is a large unmarked paved area adjacent to a taxiway, the provision of taxiway edge lights or reflective markers (in addition to taxiway centre line lights) would provide an additional cue to pilots to stay within the taxiway. This may help to prevent pilots inadvertently straying off the taxiway. - There were no edge lights or markers to show the grass area between Taxiway WA and the parking apron where Bay 117 was located. There is no requirement in ICAO Annex 14 for edge lights or markers to show the presence of grass areas adjacent to taxiways. - The drain located within the grass area between the diverted portion of Taxiway WA and the parking apron was outside the taxiway strip. According to ICAO Annex 14, drains located outside a taxiway strip are not required to be covered.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Singapore Report number: AIB/AAI/CAS.004 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Approximately one hour into the flight, while the aircraft was in cruise at flight level 330 (FL330), the crew experienced the sudden onset of heavy airframe vibration and received an ENG 3 REVERSER annunciation from the engine indicating and crew alerting system (EICAS). The crew initially reduced the no.3 engine power and carried out the 'Engine Reverser Unlocked' actions from the aircraft quick-reference handbook (QRH). The crew stated that the engine appeared to be functioning normally at that time. After further EICAS status and advisory messages however, the crew elected to carry out other QRH checklists, concluding with the shutdown of the no. 3 engine. The captain made a PAN call to air traffic control and subsequently an advisory announcement to the passengers. To reduce airframe vibration after the engine was shut down, the first officer, who was the handling pilot, descended the aircraft to FL180 and reduced airspeed. A third crew member who was resting at the time of the event went back into the cabin to examine the engines and found extensive damage to the no. 3 engine nacelle and strut fairings. After that information was reported to the flight crew, a further QRH checklist Fire Engine, Severe Damage or Separation was actioned, although at no time was there any reported indication or sign of fire. A decision to return to Sydney was made and fuel was jettisoned to establish a landing weight within limits. In consideration of the damage to the engine and to minimise the risk should the engine or components separate, an over-water approach to runway 34L was requested. The aircraft landed safely at 19:47. Significant Factors: 1. During the 1991 manufacture of the first-stage low-pressure compressor blade serial number GB77535, a small area of incomplete bonding remained within the interface between the two titanium alloy plates used to fabricate the blade component. 2. The presence of the incompletely bonded region was detected during preliminary non-destructive inspection, however the blade was accepted for service under the manufacturer's 'concessional assessment' program. 3. The maximum acceptable bond-line defect size limits as specified by the concessional assessment program were too large to ensure that fatigue cracks could not initiate and propagate to failure within the prescribed life limit of the blade components. 4. None of the manufacturer's prescribed periodic in-service inspections carried out on the blade during its life had detected the incomplete bond defect. None of these inspections were specifically designed for the detection of defects within the lower aerofoil section where the defect was located. 5. Fatigue cracking initiated and propagated from the upper edge of the bond-line defect in response to service loading conditions. 6. Fracture and release of the fan aerofoil section from the rotor occurred after growth of the cracking to critical size. 7. The number-3 engine failed from damage sustained during the blade failure event. 8. The aircraft sustained minor airframe and number-4 engine damage resulting from impacts with blade debris liberated from the number-3 engine nacelle and cowling.Sources: ATSB  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were no injuries, but the aircraft sustained substantial damage. The scheduled domestic passenger flight was preparing to depart for Chicago-O'Hare International Airport, Illinois. After completing de-icing procedures on a company Boeing 757-200, the driver of the de-icing truck maneuvered his truck in a manner that caused the de-icing basket boom to impact the trailing edge of the aircraft's left aileron. The boom penetrated the aileron to a depth of almost two feet and damaged its spar. The investigation revealed that while backing out from his position behind the aircraft's left wing, the driver had inadvertently turned his steering wheel in a direction that caused the boom, which is mounted on the back end of the truck, to converge on the trailing edge of the aileron. The failure of the deicing truck driver to insure that the deicing basket boom remained clear of the aircraft structure as he backed away from the position he had been in while performing deicing procedures.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: SEA02LA049 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

He had difficulty locating the airstrip due to ice fog and reduced visibility, and initially flew over the top of the runway.  A passenger saw the airstrip, and about the same time, the camp operator radioed the pilot that the airplane had just passed the camp.  The pilot made a descent and an approach to the airstrip, but the airplane stalled and collided with terrain about 1/4 mile short of the runway.  The camp operator noted that at the time of the accident there was ice fog in the area, and a portion of the runway was not visible due to the fog.  He estimated the horizontal visibility to be about 3/4 of a mile.  Postaccident inspection of the airplane disclosed approximately 1/2 inch of ice on the airplane's left lift strut and main landing gear leg.  The pilot said after the accident that either a cabin door or cargo pod door may have opened during the approach.  Postaccident inspection, and interviews with passengers, disclosed no evidence of an in-flight cargo or cabin door opening, and crush lines on the cargo pod door are consistent with the door being closed at impact.

The four crew members and thirty passengers were not injured.  AA334 departed gate Alpha 14 at 06:33, and taxied to ramp spot 22 for de-icing. The aircraft was parked at a northeast direction. The ground de-icing crew notified the flight crew to prepare for de-icing. Approximately ten minutes after de-icing began, the captain reported that he heard and felt a ""thud-like"" noise from outside the aircraft. At the same time, the APU shutdown. One of the de-icing crewmembers on the ground stated he saw a flame come from the APU exhaust and discharged the ground APU fire bottle. Approximately the same time, the #2 flight attendant who was seated in the jumpseat at the rear of the cabin, phoned the captain via the intercom and informed him that the emergency first aid kit sustained damage in the form of a three-inch hole in the back of the kit. The flight attendant stated that an apparent impact on the first aid kit had propelled it from the stowed position into the center aisle of the aircraft. The rear cabin jumpseat was located directly in front of the aft pressure bulkhead. The emergency first aid kit was stowed directly onto the aft wall of the cabin underneath the rear cabin jumpseat. Two spray trucks were used to de-ice the airplane with Type 1 de-icing fluid. The five-person crew consisted of a checker, a driver for each truck, and a spray bucket operator for each truck. The members of the de-icing crew stated that at the time they were de-icing the airplane, the wind was blowing at 20 knots and gusting. Due to the windy conditions, the drivers of the de-icing trucks had coordinated prior to de-icing the airplane to start at opposite ends of the airplane so the bucket operators would not be spraying each other as they de-iced the airplane. The bucket operators both stated that at times, the wind was whipping the stream of de-icing fluid such that they could not even see the airplane, let alone where the de-icing fluid was being sprayed. Bucket operator #1 stated that he had completed de-icing the nose, right wing, and right horizontal stabilizer of the airplane, and had just started to de-ice the right side of the vertical fin, when he heard a noise and saw that the APU was on fire. Bucket operator #2 stated that he had de-iced the left horizontal stabilizer, the left side of the vertical fin, and aft fuselage, and after the truck was repositioned, he had started to de-ice the left wing when the checker discovered the APU fire. The bucket operators stated that they knew where the F-100's APU air inlet was located, and were aware that de-icing fluid should not be sprayed into the APU inlet.  The Automated Surface Observing Station for DFW at 0700 reported winds from 320 degrees at 20 knots gusting to 27 knots, visibility 2.5 statute miles in freezing rain and ice pellets, overcast skies at 2,500 feet, temperature minus 4 degrees Celsius, dew point minus six degrees Celsius, and an altimeter setting of 30.01 inches of Mercury.  Examination of the airplane revealed APU damage, which was located inside the tailcone. The turbine wheel was found fractured into five pieces. The fracture surfaces were coarse and grainy, with no evidence of fatigue. The impeller was found intact and the impeller vane leading edges had nicks and gouges and were bent opposite the direction of rotation. Ridges on the rear face of the impeller were in line with the vanes on the front face. A fragment of the turbine wheel penetrated the aft pressure bulkhead, and was found embedded in the first aid kit that was stored directly underneath the flight attendant's aft jump seat located at the rear of the cabin. Examination of the APU was conducted at American Airlines' maintenance facility in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The examination revealed two large holes in the APU's compressor case in line with the turbine wheel's plane of rotation. The turbine wheel was broken into several pieces. The broken pieces of the turbine wheel were submitted to Honeywell's Materials Laboratory for a metallurgical examination that confirmed the APU had experienced an overspeed. Further examination did not reveal evidence of fatigue on any of the fracture surfaces. Additionally, the containment ring was broken into three pieces.  The APU has an electronic control unit (ECU) that meters fuel to the APU while it is in operation. The ECU monitors the rotor speed and will shut off fuel to the APU if it senses an overspeed, which is 107 percent. The ECU was removed from the engine and shipped to Honeywell's Anniston, Alabama facility to interrogate the ECU's non-volatile memory (NVM) and perform a diagnostic test. The NVM indicated that the APU had experienced an overspeed, which is a rotor speed of 107 percent or greater, and had commanded a shutdown. The diagnostic test showed that there were no discrepancies with the ECU. A review of American Airlines' de-icing training program showed that each of the 5 had completed annual refresher training in de-icing procedures for the F-100. During de-icing training, personnel are advised not to spray the F-100 APU inlet area, and crews are furnished diagrams of each type of airplane that highlight prohibited spray areas. In February 2001, American Airlines issued a 'Winterization Bulletin' for the F-100 advising that de-ice spray should not be sprayed into the APU inlet. Additionally, the F-100 maintenance manual section 12-31-00, page 301 specifically advises, ""Do not let de-icing and/or anti-icing fluid/water mixture go into the APU inlet. Injury to persons and/or damage to equipment can occur."" American Airlines' policy had been to operate the APU during de-icing. As a result of this event, pilots were instructed to not operate the APU during de-icing operations, and to refer to the operating manual and follow procedures for de-icing with an inoperative APU. De-icing crews were also informed of the change in de-icing procedures, regarding the operation of the APU. As a result of this event, on March 29, 2002, the National Transportation Safety Board issued Safety Recommendation A-02-05 that recommended the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) immediately issue an airworthiness directive (AD) for the Fokker F-28 MK-100 and F-28 MK-4000 airplanes that prohibits APU operation during de-icing operations. The FAA issued AD 2001-07-03 that prohibits the operation of the APU during de-icing operations for all series of the F-28 airplane. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The ground crew inadvertent application of de-icing fluid in the auxiliary power unit resulting in an overspeed and turbine wheel burst. A contributing factor was the gusty wind.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: FTW02LA088 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The first officer commenced the takeoff roll, using a decision speed of 107 kt. All appeared normal until 100 kt when the first officer glanced down and saw the red 'Doors' warning caption illuminate. He immediately called ""STOP STOP STOP"" and rejected the takeoff, bringing the aircraft to a complete halt on the runway. During the deceleration, the audio warning sounded. Once the aircraft was stationary the commander vacated his seat to check the situation in the passenger cabin whilst the first officer contacted ATC to inform them of the emergency. The commander returned to his seat, shut down the left hand engine and taxied to an allocated stand where the passengers were deplaned from a rear door. CONCLUSIONS: ""The most probable cause of the accident was that the senior cabin attendant grasped the inner door handle to restrain her upper body during the rapid acceleration of the aircraft. The ergonomics of the cabin crew seat and door handle made such an involuntary action readily conceivable. Such action lead to the door unlatching and opening rapidly. Failure of the damper attachments and disruption of the banister mechanism then allowed forcible over-travel, leading to failure of the airstair attachment arms. The remaining attachment strength of the door and airstairs to the aircraft was such that both would almost certainly have separated had the aircraft become airborne. Had separation occurred, the port propeller and other critical parts of the aircraft would probably have been struck. A catastrophic outcome could not be ruled out. The door and airstair design, though technically complying with the certification requirements, lacked the necessary integrity to prevent a hazardous occurrence to the aircraft.""Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  20 February 2005 G-BWIR ScotAirways 0 London City Airport (LCY) non Runway excursion Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

None of the 3 crewmembers or 50 passengers on board was injured. The airplane sustained damage to the number-two engine inlet, the first officer's windshield, and a 14- by 4-inch section of fuselage skin just below the windshield seal on the first officer's side.  The captain reported that the airplane was on departure roll and had accelerated past 80 knots when a flock of birds began to fly south over the runway. The airplane was traveling at approximately 110 knots when one of the birds hit the airplane, cracking the first officer's windshield and causing a few shards of glass to fall into the cockpit and onto the first officer. The captain immediately rejected the takeoff and stopped on the runway to assess the damage.  A postflight inspection by maintenance personnel revealed that the airplane had struck two wild turkeys. One turkey hit the intake of the number-two engine, slightly damaging the forward lip of the engine intake cowl. No bird remains went through the engine. The other turkey hit just below the first officer's windshield, where a turkey leg and foot were still lodged. Closer examination of the airplane revealed that the second turkey hit the nose sheet metal at the base of the first officer's windshield, bending the windshield support structure and causing the windshield to crack upward from that location. The second turkey penetrated the area beneath the lower support structure, went through the pressure bulkhead, and entered the back of the instrument panel but did not penetrate either the windshield or its supporting structure.

According to the flight plan the track would over fly Split, Pescara, the crossing of the Apennines towards Ostia and then onwards its destination, Tunis. The meteorological conditions over the central part of Italy on that March the 9th were characterized by a cold front associated with numerous thunderstorm areas, low cloud coverage over the mountainous Apennines accompanied by icing conditions. After leaving Split, and crossing the Adriatic sea LY-AVD over flew Pescara at 13:20 where the pilot informed the local ATC that the aircraft was inbound Aneda (a reporting point 19 NM East of Monte Rotondo) at a cruising altitude of 5.500 feet (1.676 m). While in vicinity of Pescara, ATC requested and obtained confirmation from LY-AVD that VFR conditions were maintainable. The radio communication ended with the instruction to LY-AVD to contact Rome AIS Centre. There is no record of communication attempt by the crew and it is presumed that the aircraft, soon after that radio communication, impacted with the Monte Rotondo mountain side at an altitude of 6.167 feet (1.880 m) with an estimated ground speed of 115 Kts. DIRECT CAUSES: ""Analysis of available evidence make it reasonable to classify the event investigated as an unintentional terrain impact, Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT). At accident time, because of the reduced visibility, incompatible with VFR flying, the crew could not evaluate correctly the orography of the area along there route. It has to be noted that it was not possible to ascertain if adequate maps were available to the crew showing the exact position of ground relief and obstacles. It was not possible to determine if the pilots had flown across the same area in the past. Given the meteorological conditions over the area, the crew did not conform to the Visual Flying Rules that mandated for a track change to maintain the required flight parameters (visibility/clearance from obstacles) and/or a diversion to a suitable alternate airport (as international rules mandate)."" CONTRIBUTORY FACTORS: ""Analysis of available evidence suggests that the following may be considered as contributory factors to the accident. The prevailing meteorological conditions existing on March 9, 2002 over the flight path of LY-AVD across the central part of Italy did not allow for the flight to be continued under VFR. The Antonov AN2 was not fit for flying in low visibility (IMC) and was not equipped for flying in icing conditions. The pilot of the LY-AVD did not hold the required English language radio-telephony (RT) qualification to operate outside the country of licensing. The pilot of the LY-AVD did not hold an IFR qualification (for flying in IMC).""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ANSV Report number: A/2/03 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Soviet Transports  ANSV   Location  Images: photo (c) JP; Monte Rotondo; 07 September 2011 photo (c) JP; Monte Rotondo; 07 September 2011 photo (c) JP; Monte Rotondo; 07 September 2011 photo (c) JP; Monte Rotondo; 07 September 2011 photo (c) JP; Monte Rotondo; 07 September 2011 photo (c) JP; Monte Rotondo; 07 September 2011 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Flight crew interview statements indicated that they were preparing for turbulence and that they wanted the passengers and flight attendants seated with their seatbelts fastened.  However, the flight crew did not advise the lead flight attendant (LFA) of the turbulence level and its anticipated duration nor did they use turbulence codes, as stipulated in Northwest Airlines' Flight Operations Manual. The investigation also revealed that the LFA did not relay the turbulence information to all of the flight attendants, as stipulated in the company's Flight Attendant Manual.   Examination of the restraint system from the injured flight attendant's jump seat indicated that the restraint system did not fail during the turbulence upset. The Safety Board was unable to determine whether the lapbelt was improperly secured by the flight attendant or whether it was inadvertently disengaged during the turbulence upset.  The Safety Board's investigation examined the turbulence and the flight crew's operation of the airplane during the turbulence encounter to evaluate the effects on the airplane occupants.  Analysis of the flight data recorder (FDR) data indicates that the turbulence caused substantial vertical and lateral oscillations, which may have made it difficult for the first officer (as the flying pilot) to maintain a constant pitch attitude.   The FDR data showed variations in the airplane's pitch attitude during the turbulence encounter. Despite the airplane's pitch excursions, statements from the flight crew indicate that they were attempting to maintain constant pitch attitudes during the turbulence upset.  Nevertheless, FDR data indicate that the large and rapid pitch excursions were primarily a result of control column inputs made by the first officer.  The Safety Board's investigation determined that the main pitchover (which likely caused the flight attendant's injuries) occurred as a result of the first officer's control inputs.  Probable Cause: The flight attendant's injuries were a result of her unsecured lap belt and shoulder harness for undetermined reasons, and the oscillations of the airplane, which were caused by turbulence and large control column inputs by the first officer.  Contributing to the flight attendant's injuries was the failure of the flight crew and the lead flight attendant to follow company procedures regarding dissemination of turbulence information.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA02MA029 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA02MA029 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  10 October 2000 N234NW Northwest Airlines 0 120 nm from Paris non Prop/turbine blade separation Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates25-Mar-2024 10:53 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The two flight crew members and four passengers were uninjured.  The captain, who was also the company chief pilot and check airman, was the flying pilot, and the first officer was the non flying pilot. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. Area weather reporting stations reported the presence of freezing rain and snow for a time period beginning several hours before the accident. The captain did not obtain the destination airport weather observation until the flight was approximately 30 nautical miles from the airport. The flight received radar vectors for a instrument landing system approach to runway 30 (5,401 feet by 100 feet, grooved asphalt). The company's training manual states the MU-300's intermediate and final approach speeds as 140 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS) and Vref, respectively. Vref was reported by the flight crew as 106 KIAS. During the approach, the tower controller gave the option for the flight to circle to land or continue straight in to runway 30. He advised that the winds were from 050-070 degrees at 10 knots gusting to 20 knots, and runway braking action was reported as fair to poor by a snow plow.  Radar data indicates that the airplane had a ground speed in excess of 200 knots between the final approach fix and runway threshold and a full-scale localizer deviation 5.5 nm from the localizer antenna.  The aircraft appeared to be decelerating normal, according to the captain, until approximately the 3,000 foot marker. At that point the aircraft's deceleration slowed down and the aircraft began to skid. Approaching the end of the runway the captain noticed a drop off at beyond the end of the runway. The visibility was not good enough to determine what was beyond the drop-off. The captain decided to turn the aircraft to minimize the forward speed after exiting runway and to avoid going down the hill. The aircraft came to rest 30 feet beyond the departure end to the right of centerline. The company did not have stabilized approach criteria establishing when a missed approach or go-around is to be executed. The captain stated that he was unaware that there was 0.7 percent downslope on runway 30. The company provided a page from their airport directory which did not indicate a slope present for runway 30. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""Missed approach not executed and flight to a destination alternate not performed by the flight crew. The tail wind and snow/ice covered runway were contributing factors.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CHI02FA097 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft was restored to original condition with Pan American Airlines livery, carrying the name ""Clipper Flying Cloud"". On March 28, 2002 the aircraft took off from Boeing Field for a local flight around 12:30. The crew were to practice takeoffs and landings and shake out any mechanical problems. Both pilots were planning to do three takeoffs and landings each, with a refueling stop in between. The first pair were uneventful, with the plane flying from Boeing Field to Everett-Paine Field. On takeoff there, at 12:51, the No. 3 engine surged briefly. It returned to normal, but the pilots decided to abort the rest of the practice and return to Boeing Field. On approach it appeared that the left-main landing gear had not locked down. The approach was aborted and the plane circled Vashon and Bainbridge islands as the flight mechanic manually cranked the wheel into the locked position. The pilot then resumed its approach. The airplane was about 6 miles from the runway when fuel pressure for the number three engine dropped below minimum. The boost pumps were turned on; however, fuel pressure did not recover, and the engine lost power. The low fuel pressure light then illuminated for the number four engine. The captain commanded the flight engineer to switch fuel feed to another tank. The flight engineer's response was, ""There is no other tank. We're out of fuel."" The captain pushed the throttles forward and called for the number three engine to be feathered. When the throttles were pushed forward, multiple engine surges occurred. Then the surging stopped, and it appeared that the remaining engines had also lost power. The airplane was rapidly losing altitude and the captain decided to ditch in Elliott Bay. After landing, the airplane remained afloat while the crew evacuated. They were quickly picked up by rescue boats. The airplane was subsequently towed to shallower water by a Seattle Police Department boat before it partially sank in the water just offshore. The day after the accident, the aircraft was lifted from the water. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""Loss of all engine power due to fuel exhaustion that resulted from the flight crew's failure to accurately determine onboard fuel during the pre-flight inspection.  A factor contributing to the accident was a lack of adequate crew communication regarding the fuel status.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: SEA02FA060 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: AP  NTSB  Seattle Times  Images: photo (c) Scott Cronk, Seattle - http://www.noontimenet.com; Elliott Bay, WA; March 2002 photo (c) Scott Cronk, Seattle - http://www.noontimenet.com; Elliott Bay, WA; March 2002 photo (c) Â© Bob Harrington, Seattle - http://bobqat.com; Elliott Bay, WA; March 2002 photo (c) Â© Bob Harrington, Seattle - http://bobqat.com; Elliott Bay, WA; March 2002 photo (c) Karl KrÃ¤mer, via Werner Fischdick; Oshkosh-Wittman Field, WI (OSH); July 2001 photo (c) Harry S.

After level off the relief pilot left the cockpit to begin his rest period. Within a few minutes he observed that the number 2 engine master warning light was illuminated, as well as a level 3 alert on the Engine and Alert Display and a red light on the number 2 fire handle and fuel shutoff lever. The fire bell did not activate. He and the first officer performed the memory and initial action items on the hard card checklists for an engine fire and shutdown the No. 2 engine. In addition, the captain discharged an engine fire bottle. The engine fire light continued to illuminate. The captain then fired a second engine fire bottle. The engine fire light continued to be illuminated. The captain requested that the relief pilot return to the cockpit. He then contacted  Air Traffic Control (ATC) and told them that their No. 2 engine was on fire and that they intended to land at the nearest suitable field. ATC responded that Charlotte was 35 miles away with a 10,000 foot runway. He asked for radar vectors and an immediate descent into Charlotte. They were given a lower altitude. The first officer initiated fuel dumping. The relief pilot returned to the cockpit and he asked the relief pilot and the first officer to run the checklists. As they descended the aircraft encountered heavy rain, light hail, and moderate turbulence. In addition, they observed a bright flash to the left of the nose, which might have been a lightning strike. As they completed the descent and approach checklists he told the crew to expect an emergency evacuation upon landing and directed the first officer to so inform the flight attendants. The aircraft was configured for an engine out approach and they reviewed the loss of a second engine procedure. The remainder of the approach, touchdown and landing roll occurred within normal parameters. He brought the airplane to a stop on the runway. The engine fire indication remained illuminated. The relief pilot stated they did not terminate fuel dumping prior to landing. They completed the items on the evacuation checklist. He then ordered an evacuation of the airplane. According to Delta Air Lines representatives, examination of the No. 2 engine by company maintenance personnel found one fire loop chafed through an adjacent cable, an integrated drive generator (IDG) feeder cable, inside the No. 2 engine cowling This allowed a direct 115 volt AC connection between the IDG and the fire detection control unit. The result was an electrical short and complete failure of the detection control unit that was indicated in the cockpit as a  fire warning. There was no evidence of fire in the No. 2 engine. Boeing Service  Bullettin MD11-71-086 was issued on May 21, 1996. The subject of the service bulletin was ""Power Plant - Electrical Harness - Replace/Modify Integrated Drive Generator (IDG) Wire Harness Support Brackets"". On May 21, 2001, Boeing elevated the service bulletin to the ""Alert"" level. Boeing recommended that aircraft operators accomplish the service bulletin within 1 year. According to Delta Air Lines personnel, in November 2001, Delta Air Lines Aircraft Engineering issued a Engineering Order to comply with Alert Service Bulletin MD11-71A086. The Engineering Order stated that all engines should be inspected and modified by November 2002. All three engines on the accident aircraft were inspected and modified in accordance with the Engineering Order on March 3, 2002. On March 28, 2002, the No. 2 engine was changed and the engine installed had not been modified by the Engineering Order.The Delta Airlines descent, approach, and before landing checklists dated June 30, 2000, and which were in use at the time of the accident, required the pilots to check the Engine and Alert Display. When fuel dumping is activated, a message is displayed on the Engine and Alert Display. Probable Cause: The failure of the aircraft operator to comply with, in a timely manner, on the No. 2 engine, Boeing Alert Service Bulletin MD11-71A086, resulting in the integrated drive generator feeder cable chaffing through a fire warning loop and failure of the fire warning system due to electrical damage. This resulted in a continuous indication in the cockpit of a No. 2 engine fire, an emergency descent and landing, and injuries to passengers during the subsequent emergency evacuation of the airplane.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: MIA02FA075 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources: NTSB MIA02FA075  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates25-Mar-2024 10:48 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

Air China flight 129 departed Beijing at 08:37 on a scheduled flight to Pusan-Gimhae in South Korea. The en route part of the flight was uneventful. At 11:06 the second officer contacted Gimhae Approach. At that moment the airplane was 32 nm from the airport at an altitude of FL170. The approach controller cleared the flight to descend to 6000 feet. Runway 36L was in use and the crew could expect a straight-in approach. at 11:09 the controller notified the crew that the runway was changed to 18R, with winds 210 degrees at 17 kts. This meant a circling approach which none of the crew members had flown yet at Pusan. The captain and first officer then discussed the approach to be flown. The captain cautioned: ""We won't enlarge the traffic pattern, the mountains are all over that side."" At 11:13 the flight was further cleared down to 2600 feet. Two minutes later the approach controller radioed: ""Air China 129, turn left heading 030 cleared for ILS DME runway 36L, then circle to runway 18 right, report field in sight."" At 11:17 they captured the ILS and were cleared further down to the circling altitude of 700 feet. The landing gear was extended and flaps set at 20 degrees. Then the controller instructed the flight to contact Gimhae Tower and to circle west. The second officer responded but did not read back the frequency change. The captain then instructed the first officer to disconnect the autopilot and turn left. From his position in the right hand seat the first officer was able to observe the runway. As the aircraft passed abeam the runway the autopilot was reengaged with heading select. At that moment the approach controller again contacted flight 129 instructing them to contact the tower. The crew were busy looking outside to see when they passed abeam the end of the runway. Simultaneously the Gimhae Tower controller contacted the flight using the emergency frequency. As they passed abeam the threshold at 11:20:02 they started timing to measure the commencement f turning to base. Eleven seconds after the call on the emergency frequency, the second officer reported to the Tower controller that they were on the circle approach. At 11:20:17 the captain took over control from the first officer and said he was going to turn base. He slowly began a widening turn, causing the first officer to urge him: ""turn quickly, not too late."" Meanwhile the flight was cleared to land . At 11:20:32 the captain disconnected the autopilot and banked the plane to the right. Twenty-two seconds later the first officer cautioned: ""Pay attention to the altitude keeping,"" and the captain asked him to help him get a visual on the runway. Due to the limited visibility they were not able to see the runway. The first officer then advised the captain to initiate a go around, but the captain did not respond. At 11:21:15 the first officer said, ""Pull up! Pull up!"" Pitch attitude was increased to 11.4 degrees but thrust was not increased. Two seconds later the aircraft impacted a mountain, about 4.6 km from the runway. FINDINGS RELATED TO PROBABLE CAUSES: 1. The flight crew of flight 129 performed the circling approach, not being aware of the weather minima of wide-body aircraft (B767-200) for landing, and in the approach briefing, did not include the missed approach, etc., among the items specified in Air ChinaÂs operations and training manuals. 2. The flight crew exercised poor crew resource management and lost situational awareness during the circling approach to runway 18R, which led them to fly outside of the circling approach area, delaying the base turn, contrary to the captainÂs intention to make a timely base turn. 3. The flight crew did not execute a missed approach when they lost sight of the runway during the circling approach to runway 18R, which led them to strike high terrain (mountain) near the airport. 4. When the first officer advised the captain to execute a missed approach about 5 seconds before impact, the captain did not react, nor did the first officer initiate the missed approach himself.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: KAIB Report number: KAIB/AAR F0201 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) Aviation Safety Network photo (c) Peter Frei; Berlin-SchÃ¶nefeld Airport (SXF); 09 July 1990 photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Beijing-Capital Airport (PEK); 18 October 1996 photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Beijing-Capital Airport (PEK); 30 March 1997 photo (c) Ralph Kunadt; Guangzhou-Baiyun Airport (CAN); 23 November 1991 photo (c) Alan Tsui; Hong Kong-Kai Tak International Airport (HKG); 21 November 1999 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates02-Jan-2025 10:51 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The captain briefed the lead flight attendant on the expected turbulence encounter and asked that the cabin be secured early with everyone, including the flight attendants, in their seats and secured.  A prearranged chime signal would notify the lead flight attendant that everyone should be in their seats.  After the chime signal, everyone was seated and secured; however, a flight attendant seated in the rear of the airplane noticed that a galley upper door compartment had come open.  This compartment was in line with both her head and another attendant's head, and she was concerned about objects coming out of the compartment during landing and injuring either one of them.  She unfastened her restraints, got up, and secured the door.  As she was returning to her seat, the airplane encountered a severe jolt, which violently slammed her into the ceiling, then the floor.

The crew was anticipating a visual approach to Runway 36 at Winnipeg International Airport but, because of conflicting traffic, accepted vectors for the instrument landing system (ILS) approach to Runway 13. At approximately 1908 central daylight time, the aircraft landed to the right of the runway centreline, then drifted further right and departed the runway surface, damaging a runway edge light, a taxiway edge light, and a runway identification sign. It then travelled 1150 feet through the infield and came to rest near the intersection of Runways 13/31 and 18/36. There were no reported injuries. The aircraft's left engine (Garrett TPE 33) sustained damage from ingested mud and vegetation. The right wing, left wing, and fuselage were damaged when the aircraft struck the edge lights and the runway identification sign. After the aircraft stopped, the crew shut down the engines and advised the Winnipeg Airport air traffic controller of their position.

The airplane was traveling in a predominately northern direction at 37,000 feet altitude during the encounter.   Weather products obtained showed that extreme intensity thunderstorms existed in the area where the turbulence was encountered.  Weather data and aircraft position radar data show that the airplane was 9 miles south-southwest of a cloud buildup that extended to 39,000 feet.  Additionally, the airplane was 5 miles west of an extreme intensity radar echo associated with the thunderstorms in the area.  The airline's General Operations Manual states that thunderstorms that are identified as severe, or giving a intense radar echo should be avoided by at least 20 miles.  No National Weather Service aviation weather advisories were in effect for the location and time of the turbulence encounter.  Communications transcripts show that the flight crew requested and were granted a course deviation for weather about 10 minutes prior to the upset. However, the Digital Flight Data Recorder shows that the seat belt sign was illuminated only 10 seconds prior to the encounter. Probable Cause: The flightcrew's failure to follow weather avoidance prcedures and their delay in activating the seat belt sign.   Factors were the turbulent thunderstorm weather conditions, and the failure of the National Weather Service to issue an applicable in-flight weather advisory.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CHI02LA111 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB CHI02LA111  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates25-Mar-2024 10:48 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

The flight was the third flight of eight flights planned for the day between Jayapura and Wamena. The en route part of the flight was uneventful and the pilot carried out an S-approach pattern for runway 15. Because the crew misjudged their distance to the runway they ended up being unable to decrease speed and extend flaps to landing configuration. With a high rate of descent the aircraft touched down. On touchdown the airplane bounced twice, the second and last bounce was reported to be more severe than the first one, causing the nose gear to collapse. The hydraulic system sustained damage, causing fluid to leak, which caught fire due to the friction of the aircraft on the runway. The captain applied reverse power and brakes, controlling the aircraft by using rudder inputs. The airplane decelerated with smoke emitting from the forward cargo compartment. After coming to a standstill, the loadmaster opened the airplane door taking the extinguisher, attempting to extinguish the fire. The airport fire truck could not be started, so the fire fighting personnel ran to the airplane carrying portable fire extinguishers. After twenty minutes the truck's battery had been recharged.

The flight was cleared to taxi at 12:01 hrs. The captain was pilot-non-flying and was seated in the right cockpit seat. During taxi, the crew completed their normal Before Takeoff Checks; these included confirmation that the control checks had been completed and that anti-ice might be required immediately after takeoff. Flap 20 had been selected for takeoff and the following speeds had been calculated and briefed by the pilots: V1 137 kt; VR 140 kt; V2 147 kt. By 12:06, the aircraft was cleared to line up on runway 15. At 12:07 hrs, N90AG was cleared for takeoff with a surface wind of 140Â°/8 kt. Takeoff appeared normal up to lift-off. Rotation was started at about 146 kt. Lift-off occurred 2 seconds later, at about 153 kt and with a pitch attitude of about 8 degrees nose-up. Immediately after lift-off, the aircraft started to bank to the left. The rate of bank increased rapidly and 2 seconds after lift-off the bank angle had reached 50 degrees. At that point, the aircraft heading had diverged about 10 degrees to the left. Opposite aileron, followed closely by right rudder, was applied as the aircraft started banking; full right aileron and full right rudder had been applied within 1 second and were maintained. As the bank angle continued to increase, progressively more aircraft nose-up elevator was applied. Stick-shaker operation initiated 3.5 seconds after lift-off. The left winglet contacted the runway shoulder, the outboard part of the left wing detached and the aircraft struck the ground inverted, structurally separating the forward fuselage. Fuel released from ruptured tanks ignited and the wreckage slid to a halt on fire. The last recorded aircraft attitude was approximately 111 degrees left bank and 13 degrees nose-down pitch. CAUSAL FACTORS: ""1. The crew did not ensure that N90AG's wings were clear of frost prior to takeoff.;  2. Reduction of the wing stall angle of attack, due to the surface roughness associated with frost contamination, to below that at which the stall protection system was effective.; 3. Possible impairment of crew performance by the combined effects of a non-prescription drug, jet-lag and fatigue.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: AAIB AAR 5-2004 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) aeroprints.com; Rantoul, KS; 30 April 2013; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane was prepared for the continuing flight to Batam. At 10:05 the First Officer asked for start clearance and received weather information. The weather was fine, wind calm and clear. After start-up was completed, the aircraft taxied to runway 18. The crew decided to use 'reduced take off power' with an assumed temperature of 35 deg. C, while the actual temperature was 27 deg. C. The First Officer acted as Pilot Flying. After being cleared for takeoff, the captain advanced the throttles and adjusted them to the required take off power setting. He then called the V1 and VR speeds and the First Officer pulled the control column to a 15 deg. nose up pitch. The aircraftÂs nose lifted up, but the aircraft did not become airborne. The stick shaker activated. The captain then added power and the speed increased to V2+15 (approx. 158 KIAS) but the aircraft still did not get airborne. The captain then decided to abort . He called 'stop', retarded the power levers to idle, applied reverse thrust, extended the speed brake and applied brakes. The nose of the aircraft touched down hard, causing the front left door (L1) to open and two trolleys at front galley to move forward, blocking the cockpit door. The flight crew turned the aircraft slightly to the right to avoid approach lights ahead. It hit some trees and stopped at approx. 275 meters from the end of runway. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""Since there is no indication that flaps system failure or flap asymmetry contributes in the failure of flap to travel to take-off configuration, the most probable cause for the failure is the improper execution of take-off checklist.

The aircraft climbed to its assigned cruising altitude of FL220, which was reached at 06:53. Permission to descend was given at 07:12 and at 07:23 the crew started an ILS approach to runway 30. Two minutes later the captain experienced control problems, which he attributed to an autopilot malfunction. An increase in the rate of descent went unnoticed by the crew who tried to find out the cause of the control problems. As the plane was descending over mountainous terrain, the GPWS alarm sounded three times. The approach controller then asked if the flight was established on the localizer and ILS glidepath. The copilot then replied that they had captured the localizer. Approach Control then instructed the crew to contact Bilbao Tower. Contact was not established however. The copilot noticed that they had not captured the glidepath and informed the captain. The airplaneÂ´s speed and rate of descent were reduced and a smooth climb was initiated. Six seconds later the airplane flew into the side of the Monte de Santa Marina, some 18 nm (33 km) from Bilbao Airport. The mountain has an altitude of 675 m (2215 ft).

During the initial descent the crew decided to deviate from the planned route because of thunderstorms along their planned route. At 16:19 the flight encountered an area of severe turbulence and thunderstorm activity with extremely heavy precipitation and hail. The crew attempted to fly towards a gap between two storm cells. About 90 seconds after entering the thunderstorm, as the airplane descended through about FL180 at a flight idle power setting, both engines flamed out. The crew carried out three unsuccessful attempts to restart the engines followed by one unsuccessful attempt to start the auxiliary power unit (APU). The flight crewÂs reported actions to restart the engines and APU however, were contrary to the procedures contained in the Boeing 737 Operations Manual. For instance, they waited only about 1 minute between each restart attempt instead of three minutes.  As the airplane descended below an overcast cloud layer at about 8,000 feet, the crew observed the Bengawan Solo River and decided to attempt to ditch the airplane into the river with flaps and landing gear in a shallow, 1 metre deep part of the river. One stewardess did not survive the crash.  Similar occurrences (Boeing 737-300 double engine flameout while descending in heavy precipitation with engines at flight idle) happened May 24, 1988 and July 26, 1988. Following these incidents OMB 88-5 and AD 6-14-88 were issued to require minimum rpm of 45% and to restrict the use of autothrust in moderate/heavy precipitation; engine modification was provided for increased capacity of water ingestion. Probable Cause: ""The NTSC determines that the probable causes of the accident were the combination of 1) The aircraft had entered severe hail and rain during weather avoidance which subsequently caused both engines flame out; 2) Two attempts of engine-relight failed because the aircraft was still in the precipitation beyond the enginesÂ certified capabilities; and 3) During the second attempt relight, the aircraft suffered run-out electrical power.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSC Report number: KNKT/02.02/06.01.33 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: Flight International  Jakarta Post  NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSC; near Yokyakarta; 16 January 2002 photo (c) NTSC; near Yokyakarta; 16 January 2002 photo (c) NTSC; near Yokyakarta; 16 January 2002 photo (c) Andy Martin; Jakarta-Soekarno-Hatta International Airport (CGK/WIII); 24 March 1990 photo (c) Alan Tsui; Singapore-Changi International Airport (SIN/WSSS); 04 April 1999 photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Denpasar-Ngurah Rai Bali International Airport (DPS/WADD); 03 April 1991 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The VFR flight was conducted at an altitude of 15,500 feet. At 10:50 the crew contacted the Nueva Loja Tower at Lago Agrio and reported near Olmedo. The Tower controller reported that runway 23 was in use and that the weather included a 6 knot wind at 020 degrees, temperature 29 degrees. The crew were then to have turned from 064 to 094 degrees, direct to Lago Agrio. They failed to do so and continued their present heading. After reporting 50 miles out at 10:59, they were cleared to descend. This was the last contact with the flight. The crew continued their descent until the airplane flew into the fog-shrouded side of El Tigre Mountain at an elevation of 11,916 feet. PROBABLE CAUSE (translated from Spanish): ""The Accident Investigative Board estimates that the probable cause of the accident was LOSS OF SITUATIONAL AWARENESS by the crew, since their attention was focused on aspects that were not related to the flight being executed and therefore neglecting the primary function of flight which is the control of the aircraft and decision making. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: - Crew failure to maintain a sterile cockpit - The continuous distraction of the crew throughout the flight - The lack of technical documentation in the CIA that supports the operation. - Lack of crew training in CRM, human factors and CFIT - The weather conditions at the time of the accident on Mount El Tigre made it impossible for the crew to see the mountain. - The lack of defence systems on the aircraft (GPWS ground proximity warning system)Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: DGAC Ecuador Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: El Universo  NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Quito-Mariscal Sucre Airport (UIO); 06 January 2000 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were no injuries.  The flight was destined for Atlanta, Georgia. According to the captain, the ramp was covered with snow and ice, and their gate position required a pushback with a nose swing of about 120 degrees. The airplane had an inoperative APU, and he elected to start both engines at the gate prior to pushback because a single engine crossbleed start would require an N1 of 80 percent on the operative engine. After both engines were started, the pushback was initiated. As the tug neared a 90 degree position to the right side of the nose of the airplane, it started to move forward, and then stopped when it struck the tug, after which the captain set the brakes. The captain added that he had not applied the brakes until after the airplane came to rest.  The tug driver reported that he had already pushed back two airplanes that morning with no problems, and that the initial part of the push was without incident. As the airplane entered an area where the ramp was icy, he turned the nose of the airplane to the west. The nosewheels on the airplane started slipping, and he was unable to communicate this to the cockpit crew. He stopped the tug and the airplane slid into the tug. Damage to the airplane consisted of a hole in the right side of the fuselage, located about 3 feet below the bottom of the forward, right side cabin door, and about 4 feet behind the trailing edge of the door. Internally, there was damage to the longerons. The lack of direction from the operator on how to perform pushbacks on an icy ramp, which led to the tug driver positioning the tug at an angle to the nose of the airplane that allowed the airplane to move forward and strike the tug. Factors were the inadequate visual lookout by the walker wearing the headset, and the icy ramp.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NYC02LA056 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  3 May 1972 TC-JAB TÃ¼rk Hava Yollari - THY 0 Sofia unk Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were 87 passengers and six crew members on board. Three cabin attendants sustained minor injuries. All Nippon Airways flight 391 took off from Nagoya Airport (NGO) at 11:53 on a regular domestic flight to Hakodate. After beginning descent from cruise altitude, the aircraft was radar vectored onto the final approach course by the Hakodate Approach Control, and commenced an ILS runway 12 approach at Hakodate Airport. During the approach, the captain assumed the duties of Pilot Not Flying (PNF) while the first officer assumed Pilot Flying (PF) duties. The aircraft encountered light turbulence during the approach. Hakodate Airport Tower reported the wind for runway 12 as 130Â°/28 kt, a strong and slightly right crosswind. Although the approach course and flight path angle of aircraft were both normal during the approach, the aircraftÂs wind shear warning system issued an aural wind shear warning at around 140 m from the runway threshold, at an altitude of 53 ft above ground level (AGL) while the aircraft was flying over the approach lights for runway 12. Although the crew initiated a go-around to recover from the wind shear, the aircraftÂs aft fuselage contacted the runway and as a result substantial damage was sustained. The aircraft continued to go around for recovery from the wind shear after contacted aft fuselage with the runway. The crew made another ILS approach to runway 12, and landed at Hakodate Airport at around 13:21 uneventfully. An external check after arrival found that damage had been sustained to the lower surface of the aft fuselage. PROBABLE CAUSES In this accident, it is estimated that while on final approach at a height of approximately 100ft AGL, the aircraft encountered severe wind shear and although recovery actions were taken, a sufficient rate of ascent was not attained in time to prevent the lower surface of the aft fuselage striking the runway, resulting in damage to rear frames and the aft pressure bulkhead. Further, the following factors are considered to have contributed to this accident: (1) A delay in engine thrust response to the thrust levers being advanced to recover from the wind shear, combined with a reduced approach speed, meant that an increase in speed could not be obtained immediately. These factors contributed to the fact that sufficient rate of ascent could not be attained in time to prevent the tail strike. (2) Factors contributing to the reduced approach speed were the fact that the first officer, acting as PF, had selected a slightly low value for the final approach speed, and that he reduced thrust in response to an increase in headwind. (3) Factors in the reduction of engine thrust in response to the increase in headwind were because the pilot was operating the thrust levers manually in ""SELECTED SPEED"" mode he was attempting to maintain a constant CAS, and that the flight crew had not adequately anticipated a increasing followed by a continuing drop in wind speed. (4) Regarding the selection of a slightly low value for final approach speed, appropriate consideration was not given to wind speed, and there were concerns over touch down attitude related to high approach speeds. (5) Regarding the fact that appropriate consideration was not given to wind speed, the first officer used a simple calculation formula that did not separately consider the additional airspeed margins to take account of wind speed changes and the head wind component, but that treated these together. (6) Regarding the concerns over aircraft touch down attitude at high approach speeds, the measures described in the operatorÂs AOM for dealing with a nose-down attitude assumed only the case of full flap landings, and the First Officer considered difficulty to land an aircraft with a nose-down attitude. It is considered possible that the low-level wind shear had originated due the effects of ground topography on the surface boundary layer under conditions of strong winds accompanied by gusts.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ARAIC Report number: 2003-5 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ  History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  30 March 2008 AP-BRJ Airblue 0 Lahore, min Images: photo (c) JTSB; Hakodate Airport (HKD/RJCH); January 2002 photo (c) isamuel; Akita Airport (AXT/RJSK); 09 October 2004 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane was positioned near the end of the runway with the engines shut down during an air traffic control delay.   After approximately 15 minutes, the flightcrew was informed by ground control that they should start their engines, as they would probably be released for takeoff soon.  The captain reported they were unable to start the right engine.  They performed the ""clearing procedure"" and then went on to start the left engine with no problem.  They then attempted to start the right engine again.    Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) personnel were parked near the airplane reported to air traffic control that there were smoke and flames coming from the right engine.  There were no fire warning indications in the cockpit.  The flightcrew performed the ENGINE FIRE checklist and subsequently discharged both fire suppressant bottles into the engine.  The flightcrew eventually shut down both engines and ARFF requested that the flightcrew begin evacuating the airplane.   All of the passengers were directed to the front of the airplane and the evacuation took place using the 1L and 1R doors.  A witness reported that the injured passenger stepped out of the airplane onto the slide.  The passenger bounced down the slide and went over the side of the slide approximately four to five feet above the ground.  The investigation revealed the engine start fuel scheduling for the Fuel Control Unit was high.  In addition, the ignition exciter box and igniter plugs were tested.  The ignition exciter box was found to operate intermittently on the D.C. circuit which would be used for engine start. Probable Cause: The passenger fell off the side of the slide during the emergency evacuation.  Factors were the emergency evacuation and the erratic ignition exciter.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CHI02LA069 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB CHI02LA069  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates25-Mar-2024 10:54 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

TAME Flight 120 was a scheduled flight from Quito to Cali, Colombia via TulcÃ¡n. The Boeing 727 took off from runway 17 at 10:03 for the first leg to TulcÃ¡n. The flight climbed to the cruising altitude of FL180 and proceeded on the G-675 airway towards Ipiales from where it was to turn to TulcÃ¡n. At 10:15 the flight contacted TulcÃ¡n Tower. At that moment the airplane was 29 miles from the TulcÃ¡n NDB. The crew received permission to descend to FL140 and was given the current weather information, which included 8000 metres visibility, few clouds at 200 metres and overcast at 500 metres. The approach procedure called for a speed of 180 kts, but the actual speed was much higher at 230 knots. During the descent the airplane flew into the side of the Nevado el Cumbal Volcano at 14,700 feet, 1400 feet below the summit. PROBABLE CAUSE (translated from Spanish): 1) The decision of the instructor captain and his crew to initiate and continue the operation towards Tulcan airport below the meteorological minima established in the company's SOPs.  2) Inadequate navigation and operation of the aircraft by the pilot flying and directed by the instructor captain, consisting of entering the holding pattern of the Tulcan radio beacon with a speed of 230 knots indicated airspeed and with a banking of 15 degrees exceeding the maximum stipulated speed limit of 180 knots  during the entire procedure including the holding pattern and using a banking below the recommended range of 25 to 30 degrees, thus exceeding the lateral navigation and obstacle protection limits of the holding pattern, leading this operation to the collision with El Cumbal Hill.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Aerocivil Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: El Universo   Location  Images: photo (c) Jesper Venema photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Quito-Mariscal Sucre Airport (UIO/SEQU) [HC]; 06 January 2000 photo (c) Ariel Corridor; Quito-Mariscal Sucre Airport (UIO/SEQU); 15 August 1991 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates02-Jan-2025 09:00 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Shortly before impact, the mishap crew was conducting a simulated single-engine approach to runway 31 at Ellsworth AFB. Subsequent analysis showed that there was a significantly greater amount of fuel in the left wing and left wing tip tank than the right. The gross fuel imbalance resulted from an unmonitored transfer of fuel from the right wing and right wing tip tank to the left that was initiated by the crew approximately nine and one-half minutes before impact. As the aircraft approached the point when it would normally transition to a flare, it leveled off and began a climbing turn to the west, toward the tower. It did not touch down prior to the turn, but veered left immediately during the flare, and then rolled back to wings level momentarily as it climbed. The heavier left wing, and application of power to the right engine for the go-around, caused the aircraft to roll back into a steeper left turn, stayed in a climbing left turn with the bank continuing to increase until il rolled through more than 90 degrees of bank. As the aircraft reached the highest point of the climb (approximately 450 feet), the bank angle was more than 90 degrees, and perhaps slightly inverted as the nose dropped and the aircraft began to descend. The aircraft impacted the ground in a grassy field. The accident investigation board president found clear and convincing evidence that the primary cause of the mishap was the crew's failure to follow flight manual procedures for fuel transfer. As a result, the mishap aircraft experienced a fuel imbalance significant enough to cause the aircraft to enter an unsafe roll to the left from which the pilot was not able to recover.Sources: US Department of Defense  USAAS-USAAC-USAAF-USAF Aircraft Serial Numbers--1908 to Present / Joe Baugher   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

The airplane was on jacks, for a tire change, when a mechanic needed access to the airplane's Maintenance Data Acquisition Unit (MDAU) to check out the problem that the airplane was having regarding false over speed warnings. Since the airplane was on jacks the mechanic had to disable the weight-on-wheel (WOW) switches in order to simulate that the WOW was in the ground mode, not in the air mode, and to gain access to the MDAU. The mechanic said he used a ""Popsicle stick"" to disable these switches. After the maintenance was completed the sticks were not removed, and the inspector that returned the airplane to service was not aware that the WOW switches had been disabled for any reason and no notation was mentioned in the work logs.  The aircraft was to be ferried back to Teterboro and shortly after takeoff the landing gear failed to retract. Despite several attempts the crew did not succeed in raising the gear. They elected to land, to evaluate the situation on the ground, and performed an ILS approach back to runway 27R. Shortly before touchdown the power levers were retarded to idle. At that point the spoilers deployed and the aircraft suddenly and abruptly descended to the runway with a very hard, 4.25 g, landing. The right main gear was pushed through the wing causing spilling of fuel on the runway. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""Maintenance personnel's failure to remove wooden sticks from the landing gear weight-on-wheel switches resulting in the airplane remaining in ground mode, and the in flight deployment of the spoilers when the flight crew moved the power levers to idle, during the landing flare, resulting in a hard landing.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: MIA02LA060 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 years and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

After departure, at an altitude of 15,000 feet, the flight was operating in and out of clouds.  The pilot reported that he was not receiving any significant weather radar returns ahead of the airplane.  However, as he cleared a layer of clouds, he observed a cumulus cloud that was ahead of the airplane.  The cloud was too close to avoid and he flew through the top of the cloud.  While in the cloud, the airplane encountered turbulence which threw a flight attendant located in the rear of the airplane into the air, and he subsequently fell and fractured his ankle.  The captain had briefed the crew prior to departure, but did not include any specific comments about delaying the start of cabin service until clear of the thunderstorms, nor was he specifically required to.  The airline had no written direction for the flight attendants to know when they could leave their seats and begin cabin service. Probable Cause and Findings An inadvertent encounter with convective induced turbulence, which injured a flight attendant. Factors were the failure of the airline to supply direction to the flight crew to indicate when the flight attendants could begin cabin service, and the convective induced turbulence.

The runway controller at Changi Tower instructed the aircraft to park at Bay 117, a remote aircraft parking bay. The ground movement planner at Changi Tower selected the taxiway centre line lights to guide the aircraft along Taxiway WA to Bay C7 (Bay 117 is the second parking bay after Bay C7). Instead of stopping at the end of its assigned taxi route, the aircraft continued taxiing past Bay C7 along a diverted portion of Taxiway WA. At about 00:37 hours, the aircraft called Changi Tower to indicate its position near Bay 106. Realising that the aircraft had missed its assigned parking position, the ground movement planner at Changi Tower reselected the taxiway centre line lights to guide the aircraft back to Bay 117. The aircraft followed the return route until it was abeam Bay 117 on the straight section of the diverted portion of Taxiway WA. At that location, the pilot saw the ground marshaller in position at Bay 117 on the aircraftÂs right side. Instead of continuing to follow the taxiway centre line lights on the assigned taxi route, the aircraft turned right. In doing so, it left the Taxiway WA centre line and went onto a grass area between Taxiway WA and the parking apron. The nose gear of the aircraft went across a drain within the grass area. The aircraft came to a halt when its main landing gears went into the drain at about 00:44 hours. Contributory Factors - The runway controller was not aware of the requirement for aircraft to be towed into Bay 117. He instructed flight APWP6L to follow the green lights to Bay 117 in accordance with standard ATC procedures. -  The flight crew did not notice on the Jeppesen charts that there was a turf island separating Taxiway WA from the parking apron where Bay 117 was located.  - As taxiway centre line lights were provided along Taxiway WA, according to ICAO Annex 14, there was no requirement for taxiway edge lights to be provided. However, where there is a large unmarked paved area adjacent to a taxiway, the provision of taxiway edge lights or reflective markers (in addition to taxiway centre line lights) would provide an additional cue to pilots to stay within the taxiway. This may help to prevent pilots inadvertently straying off the taxiway. - There were no edge lights or markers to show the grass area between Taxiway WA and the parking apron where Bay 117 was located. There is no requirement in ICAO Annex 14 for edge lights or markers to show the presence of grass areas adjacent to taxiways. - The drain located within the grass area between the diverted portion of Taxiway WA and the parking apron was outside the taxiway strip. According to ICAO Annex 14, drains located outside a taxiway strip are not required to be covered.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Singapore Report number: AIB/AAI/CAS.004 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Approximately one hour into the flight, while the aircraft was in cruise at flight level 330 (FL330), the crew experienced the sudden onset of heavy airframe vibration and received an ENG 3 REVERSER annunciation from the engine indicating and crew alerting system (EICAS). The crew initially reduced the no.3 engine power and carried out the 'Engine Reverser Unlocked' actions from the aircraft quick-reference handbook (QRH). The crew stated that the engine appeared to be functioning normally at that time. After further EICAS status and advisory messages however, the crew elected to carry out other QRH checklists, concluding with the shutdown of the no. 3 engine. The captain made a PAN call to air traffic control and subsequently an advisory announcement to the passengers. To reduce airframe vibration after the engine was shut down, the first officer, who was the handling pilot, descended the aircraft to FL180 and reduced airspeed. A third crew member who was resting at the time of the event went back into the cabin to examine the engines and found extensive damage to the no. 3 engine nacelle and strut fairings. After that information was reported to the flight crew, a further QRH checklist Fire Engine, Severe Damage or Separation was actioned, although at no time was there any reported indication or sign of fire. A decision to return to Sydney was made and fuel was jettisoned to establish a landing weight within limits. In consideration of the damage to the engine and to minimise the risk should the engine or components separate, an over-water approach to runway 34L was requested. The aircraft landed safely at 19:47. Significant Factors: 1. During the 1991 manufacture of the first-stage low-pressure compressor blade serial number GB77535, a small area of incomplete bonding remained within the interface between the two titanium alloy plates used to fabricate the blade component. 2. The presence of the incompletely bonded region was detected during preliminary non-destructive inspection, however the blade was accepted for service under the manufacturer's 'concessional assessment' program. 3. The maximum acceptable bond-line defect size limits as specified by the concessional assessment program were too large to ensure that fatigue cracks could not initiate and propagate to failure within the prescribed life limit of the blade components. 4. None of the manufacturer's prescribed periodic in-service inspections carried out on the blade during its life had detected the incomplete bond defect. None of these inspections were specifically designed for the detection of defects within the lower aerofoil section where the defect was located. 5. Fatigue cracking initiated and propagated from the upper edge of the bond-line defect in response to service loading conditions. 6. Fracture and release of the fan aerofoil section from the rotor occurred after growth of the cracking to critical size. 7. The number-3 engine failed from damage sustained during the blade failure event. 8. The aircraft sustained minor airframe and number-4 engine damage resulting from impacts with blade debris liberated from the number-3 engine nacelle and cowling.Sources: ATSB  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were no injuries, but the aircraft sustained substantial damage. The scheduled domestic passenger flight was preparing to depart for Chicago-O'Hare International Airport, Illinois. After completing de-icing procedures on a company Boeing 757-200, the driver of the de-icing truck maneuvered his truck in a manner that caused the de-icing basket boom to impact the trailing edge of the aircraft's left aileron. The boom penetrated the aileron to a depth of almost two feet and damaged its spar. The investigation revealed that while backing out from his position behind the aircraft's left wing, the driver had inadvertently turned his steering wheel in a direction that caused the boom, which is mounted on the back end of the truck, to converge on the trailing edge of the aileron. The failure of the deicing truck driver to insure that the deicing basket boom remained clear of the aircraft structure as he backed away from the position he had been in while performing deicing procedures.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: SEA02LA049 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

He had difficulty locating the airstrip due to ice fog and reduced visibility, and initially flew over the top of the runway.  A passenger saw the airstrip, and about the same time, the camp operator radioed the pilot that the airplane had just passed the camp.  The pilot made a descent and an approach to the airstrip, but the airplane stalled and collided with terrain about 1/4 mile short of the runway.  The camp operator noted that at the time of the accident there was ice fog in the area, and a portion of the runway was not visible due to the fog.  He estimated the horizontal visibility to be about 3/4 of a mile.  Postaccident inspection of the airplane disclosed approximately 1/2 inch of ice on the airplane's left lift strut and main landing gear leg.  The pilot said after the accident that either a cabin door or cargo pod door may have opened during the approach.  Postaccident inspection, and interviews with passengers, disclosed no evidence of an in-flight cargo or cabin door opening, and crush lines on the cargo pod door are consistent with the door being closed at impact. Probable Cause: The pilot's continued flight into adverse weather conditions, and an inadvertent stall.

The four crew members and thirty passengers were not injured.  AA334 departed gate Alpha 14 at 06:33, and taxied to ramp spot 22 for de-icing. The aircraft was parked at a northeast direction. The ground de-icing crew notified the flight crew to prepare for de-icing. Approximately ten minutes after de-icing began, the captain reported that he heard and felt a ""thud-like"" noise from outside the aircraft. At the same time, the APU shutdown. One of the de-icing crewmembers on the ground stated he saw a flame come from the APU exhaust and discharged the ground APU fire bottle. Approximately the same time, the #2 flight attendant who was seated in the jumpseat at the rear of the cabin, phoned the captain via the intercom and informed him that the emergency first aid kit sustained damage in the form of a three-inch hole in the back of the kit. The flight attendant stated that an apparent impact on the first aid kit had propelled it from the stowed position into the center aisle of the aircraft. The rear cabin jumpseat was located directly in front of the aft pressure bulkhead. The emergency first aid kit was stowed directly onto the aft wall of the cabin underneath the rear cabin jumpseat. Two spray trucks were used to de-ice the airplane with Type 1 de-icing fluid. The five-person crew consisted of a checker, a driver for each truck, and a spray bucket operator for each truck. The members of the de-icing crew stated that at the time they were de-icing the airplane, the wind was blowing at 20 knots and gusting. Due to the windy conditions, the drivers of the de-icing trucks had coordinated prior to de-icing the airplane to start at opposite ends of the airplane so the bucket operators would not be spraying each other as they de-iced the airplane. The bucket operators both stated that at times, the wind was whipping the stream of de-icing fluid such that they could not even see the airplane, let alone where the de-icing fluid was being sprayed. Bucket operator #1 stated that he had completed de-icing the nose, right wing, and right horizontal stabilizer of the airplane, and had just started to de-ice the right side of the vertical fin, when he heard a noise and saw that the APU was on fire. Bucket operator #2 stated that he had de-iced the left horizontal stabilizer, the left side of the vertical fin, and aft fuselage, and after the truck was repositioned, he had started to de-ice the left wing when the checker discovered the APU fire. The bucket operators stated that they knew where the F-100's APU air inlet was located, and were aware that de-icing fluid should not be sprayed into the APU inlet.  The Automated Surface Observing Station for DFW at 0700 reported winds from 320 degrees at 20 knots gusting to 27 knots, visibility 2.5 statute miles in freezing rain and ice pellets, overcast skies at 2,500 feet, temperature minus 4 degrees Celsius, dew point minus six degrees Celsius, and an altimeter setting of 30.01 inches of Mercury.  Examination of the airplane revealed APU damage, which was located inside the tailcone. The turbine wheel was found fractured into five pieces. The fracture surfaces were coarse and grainy, with no evidence of fatigue. The impeller was found intact and the impeller vane leading edges had nicks and gouges and were bent opposite the direction of rotation. Ridges on the rear face of the impeller were in line with the vanes on the front face. A fragment of the turbine wheel penetrated the aft pressure bulkhead, and was found embedded in the first aid kit that was stored directly underneath the flight attendant's aft jump seat located at the rear of the cabin. Examination of the APU was conducted at American Airlines' maintenance facility in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The examination revealed two large holes in the APU's compressor case in line with the turbine wheel's plane of rotation. The turbine wheel was broken into several pieces. The broken pieces of the turbine wheel were submitted to Honeywell's Materials Laboratory for a metallurgical examination that confirmed the APU had experienced an overspeed. Further examination did not reveal evidence of fatigue on any of the fracture surfaces. Additionally, the containment ring was broken into three pieces.  The APU has an electronic control unit (ECU) that meters fuel to the APU while it is in operation. The ECU monitors the rotor speed and will shut off fuel to the APU if it senses an overspeed, which is 107 percent. The ECU was removed from the engine and shipped to Honeywell's Anniston, Alabama facility to interrogate the ECU's non-volatile memory (NVM) and perform a diagnostic test. The NVM indicated that the APU had experienced an overspeed, which is a rotor speed of 107 percent or greater, and had commanded a shutdown. The diagnostic test showed that there were no discrepancies with the ECU. A review of American Airlines' de-icing training program showed that each of the 5 had completed annual refresher training in de-icing procedures for the F-100. During de-icing training, personnel are advised not to spray the F-100 APU inlet area, and crews are furnished diagrams of each type of airplane that highlight prohibited spray areas. In February 2001, American Airlines issued a 'Winterization Bulletin' for the F-100 advising that de-ice spray should not be sprayed into the APU inlet. Additionally, the F-100 maintenance manual section 12-31-00, page 301 specifically advises, ""Do not let de-icing and/or anti-icing fluid/water mixture go into the APU inlet. Injury to persons and/or damage to equipment can occur."" American Airlines' policy had been to operate the APU during de-icing. As a result of this event, pilots were instructed to not operate the APU during de-icing operations, and to refer to the operating manual and follow procedures for de-icing with an inoperative APU. De-icing crews were also informed of the change in de-icing procedures, regarding the operation of the APU. As a result of this event, on March 29, 2002, the National Transportation Safety Board issued Safety Recommendation A-02-05 that recommended the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) immediately issue an airworthiness directive (AD) for the Fokker F-28 MK-100 and F-28 MK-4000 airplanes that prohibits APU operation during de-icing operations. The FAA issued AD 2001-07-03 that prohibits the operation of the APU during de-icing operations for all series of the F-28 airplane. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The ground crew inadvertent application of de-icing fluid in the auxiliary power unit resulting in an overspeed and turbine wheel burst. A contributing factor was the gusty wind.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: FTW02LA088 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The first officer commenced the takeoff roll, using a decision speed of 107 kt. All appeared normal until 100 kt when the first officer glanced down and saw the red 'Doors' warning caption illuminate. He immediately called ""STOP STOP STOP"" and rejected the takeoff, bringing the aircraft to a complete halt on the runway. During the deceleration, the audio warning sounded. Once the aircraft was stationary the commander vacated his seat to check the situation in the passenger cabin whilst the first officer contacted ATC to inform them of the emergency. The commander returned to his seat, shut down the left hand engine and taxied to an allocated stand where the passengers were deplaned from a rear door. CONCLUSIONS: ""The most probable cause of the accident was that the senior cabin attendant grasped the inner door handle to restrain her upper body during the rapid acceleration of the aircraft. The ergonomics of the cabin crew seat and door handle made such an involuntary action readily conceivable. Such action lead to the door unlatching and opening rapidly. Failure of the damper attachments and disruption of the banister mechanism then allowed forcible over-travel, leading to failure of the airstair attachment arms. The remaining attachment strength of the door and airstairs to the aircraft was such that both would almost certainly have separated had the aircraft become airborne. Had separation occurred, the port propeller and other critical parts of the aircraft would probably have been struck. A catastrophic outcome could not be ruled out. The door and airstair design, though technically complying with the certification requirements, lacked the necessary integrity to prevent a hazardous occurrence to the aircraft.""Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  20 February 2005 G-BWIR ScotAirways 0 London City Airport (LCY) non Runway excursion Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

None of the 3 crewmembers or 50 passengers on board was injured. The airplane sustained damage to the number-two engine inlet, the first officer's windshield, and a 14- by 4-inch section of fuselage skin just below the windshield seal on the first officer's side.  The captain reported that the airplane was on departure roll and had accelerated past 80 knots when a flock of birds began to fly south over the runway. The airplane was traveling at approximately 110 knots when one of the birds hit the airplane, cracking the first officer's windshield and causing a few shards of glass to fall into the cockpit and onto the first officer. The captain immediately rejected the takeoff and stopped on the runway to assess the damage.  A postflight inspection by maintenance personnel revealed that the airplane had struck two wild turkeys. One turkey hit the intake of the number-two engine, slightly damaging the forward lip of the engine intake cowl. No bird remains went through the engine. The other turkey hit just below the first officer's windshield, where a turkey leg and foot were still lodged. Closer examination of the airplane revealed that the second turkey hit the nose sheet metal at the base of the first officer's windshield, bending the windshield support structure and causing the windshield to crack upward from that location. The second turkey penetrated the area beneath the lower support structure, went through the pressure bulkhead, and entered the back of the instrument panel but did not penetrate either the windshield or its supporting structure.

According to the flight plan the track would over fly Split, Pescara, the crossing of the Apennines towards Ostia and then onwards its destination, Tunis. The meteorological conditions over the central part of Italy on that March the 9th were characterized by a cold front associated with numerous thunderstorm areas, low cloud coverage over the mountainous Apennines accompanied by icing conditions. After leaving Split, and crossing the Adriatic sea LY-AVD over flew Pescara at 13:20 where the pilot informed the local ATC that the aircraft was inbound Aneda (a reporting point 19 NM East of Monte Rotondo) at a cruising altitude of 5.500 feet (1.676 m). While in vicinity of Pescara, ATC requested and obtained confirmation from LY-AVD that VFR conditions were maintainable. The radio communication ended with the instruction to LY-AVD to contact Rome AIS Centre. There is no record of communication attempt by the crew and it is presumed that the aircraft, soon after that radio communication, impacted with the Monte Rotondo mountain side at an altitude of 6.167 feet (1.880 m) with an estimated ground speed of 115 Kts. DIRECT CAUSES: ""Analysis of available evidence make it reasonable to classify the event investigated as an unintentional terrain impact, Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT). At accident time, because of the reduced visibility, incompatible with VFR flying, the crew could not evaluate correctly the orography of the area along there route. It has to be noted that it was not possible to ascertain if adequate maps were available to the crew showing the exact position of ground relief and obstacles. It was not possible to determine if the pilots had flown across the same area in the past. Given the meteorological conditions over the area, the crew did not conform to the Visual Flying Rules that mandated for a track change to maintain the required flight parameters (visibility/clearance from obstacles) and/or a diversion to a suitable alternate airport (as international rules mandate)."" CONTRIBUTORY FACTORS: ""Analysis of available evidence suggests that the following may be considered as contributory factors to the accident. The prevailing meteorological conditions existing on March 9, 2002 over the flight path of LY-AVD across the central part of Italy did not allow for the flight to be continued under VFR. The Antonov AN2 was not fit for flying in low visibility (IMC) and was not equipped for flying in icing conditions. The pilot of the LY-AVD did not hold the required English language radio-telephony (RT) qualification to operate outside the country of licensing. The pilot of the LY-AVD did not hold an IFR qualification (for flying in IMC).""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ANSV Report number: A/2/03 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Soviet Transports  ANSV   Location  Images: photo (c) JP; Monte Rotondo; 07 September 2011 photo (c) JP; Monte Rotondo; 07 September 2011 photo (c) JP; Monte Rotondo; 07 September 2011 photo (c) JP; Monte Rotondo; 07 September 2011 photo (c) JP; Monte Rotondo; 07 September 2011 photo (c) JP; Monte Rotondo; 07 September 2011 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Flight crew interview statements indicated that they were preparing for turbulence and that they wanted the passengers and flight attendants seated with their seatbelts fastened.  However, the flight crew did not advise the lead flight attendant (LFA) of the turbulence level and its anticipated duration nor did they use turbulence codes, as stipulated in Northwest Airlines' Flight Operations Manual. The investigation also revealed that the LFA did not relay the turbulence information to all of the flight attendants, as stipulated in the company's Flight Attendant Manual.   Examination of the restraint system from the injured flight attendant's jump seat indicated that the restraint system did not fail during the turbulence upset. The Safety Board was unable to determine whether the lapbelt was improperly secured by the flight attendant or whether it was inadvertently disengaged during the turbulence upset.  The Safety Board's investigation examined the turbulence and the flight crew's operation of the airplane during the turbulence encounter to evaluate the effects on the airplane occupants.  Analysis of the flight data recorder (FDR) data indicates that the turbulence caused substantial vertical and lateral oscillations, which may have made it difficult for the first officer (as the flying pilot) to maintain a constant pitch attitude.   The FDR data showed variations in the airplane's pitch attitude during the turbulence encounter. Despite the airplane's pitch excursions, statements from the flight crew indicate that they were attempting to maintain constant pitch attitudes during the turbulence upset.  Nevertheless, FDR data indicate that the large and rapid pitch excursions were primarily a result of control column inputs made by the first officer.  The Safety Board's investigation determined that the main pitchover (which likely caused the flight attendant's injuries) occurred as a result of the first officer's control inputs.  Probable Cause: The flight attendant's injuries were a result of her unsecured lap belt and shoulder harness for undetermined reasons, and the oscillations of the airplane, which were caused by turbulence and large control column inputs by the first officer.  Contributing to the flight attendant's injuries was the failure of the flight crew and the lead flight attendant to follow company procedures regarding dissemination of turbulence information.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA02MA029 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA02MA029 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  10 October 2000 N234NW Northwest Airlines 0 120 nm from Paris non Prop/turbine blade separation Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates25-Mar-2024 10:53 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The two flight crew members and four passengers were uninjured.  The captain, who was also the company chief pilot and check airman, was the flying pilot, and the first officer was the non flying pilot. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. Area weather reporting stations reported the presence of freezing rain and snow for a time period beginning several hours before the accident. The captain did not obtain the destination airport weather observation until the flight was approximately 30 nautical miles from the airport. The flight received radar vectors for a instrument landing system approach to runway 30 (5,401 feet by 100 feet, grooved asphalt). The company's training manual states the MU-300's intermediate and final approach speeds as 140 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS) and Vref, respectively. Vref was reported by the flight crew as 106 KIAS. During the approach, the tower controller gave the option for the flight to circle to land or continue straight in to runway 30. He advised that the winds were from 050-070 degrees at 10 knots gusting to 20 knots, and runway braking action was reported as fair to poor by a snow plow.  Radar data indicates that the airplane had a ground speed in excess of 200 knots between the final approach fix and runway threshold and a full-scale localizer deviation 5.5 nm from the localizer antenna.  The aircraft appeared to be decelerating normal, according to the captain, until approximately the 3,000 foot marker. At that point the aircraft's deceleration slowed down and the aircraft began to skid. Approaching the end of the runway the captain noticed a drop off at beyond the end of the runway. The visibility was not good enough to determine what was beyond the drop-off. The captain decided to turn the aircraft to minimize the forward speed after exiting runway and to avoid going down the hill. The aircraft came to rest 30 feet beyond the departure end to the right of centerline. The company did not have stabilized approach criteria establishing when a missed approach or go-around is to be executed. The captain stated that he was unaware that there was 0.7 percent downslope on runway 30. The company provided a page from their airport directory which did not indicate a slope present for runway 30. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""Missed approach not executed and flight to a destination alternate not performed by the flight crew. The tail wind and snow/ice covered runway were contributing factors.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CHI02FA097 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft was restored to original condition with Pan American Airlines livery, carrying the name ""Clipper Flying Cloud"". On March 28, 2002 the aircraft took off from Boeing Field for a local flight around 12:30. The crew were to practice takeoffs and landings and shake out any mechanical problems. Both pilots were planning to do three takeoffs and landings each, with a refueling stop in between. The first pair were uneventful, with the plane flying from Boeing Field to Everett-Paine Field. On takeoff there, at 12:51, the No. 3 engine surged briefly. It returned to normal, but the pilots decided to abort the rest of the practice and return to Boeing Field. On approach it appeared that the left-main landing gear had not locked down. The approach was aborted and the plane circled Vashon and Bainbridge islands as the flight mechanic manually cranked the wheel into the locked position. The pilot then resumed its approach. The airplane was about 6 miles from the runway when fuel pressure for the number three engine dropped below minimum. The boost pumps were turned on; however, fuel pressure did not recover, and the engine lost power. The low fuel pressure light then illuminated for the number four engine. The captain commanded the flight engineer to switch fuel feed to another tank. The flight engineer's response was, ""There is no other tank. We're out of fuel."" The captain pushed the throttles forward and called for the number three engine to be feathered. When the throttles were pushed forward, multiple engine surges occurred. Then the surging stopped, and it appeared that the remaining engines had also lost power. The airplane was rapidly losing altitude and the captain decided to ditch in Elliott Bay. After landing, the airplane remained afloat while the crew evacuated. They were quickly picked up by rescue boats. The airplane was subsequently towed to shallower water by a Seattle Police Department boat before it partially sank in the water just offshore. The day after the accident, the aircraft was lifted from the water. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""Loss of all engine power due to fuel exhaustion that resulted from the flight crew's failure to accurately determine onboard fuel during the pre-flight inspection.  A factor contributing to the accident was a lack of adequate crew communication regarding the fuel status.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: SEA02FA060 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: AP  NTSB  Seattle Times  Images: photo (c) Scott Cronk, Seattle - http://www.noontimenet.com; Elliott Bay, WA; March 2002 photo (c) Scott Cronk, Seattle - http://www.noontimenet.com; Elliott Bay, WA; March 2002 photo (c) Â© Bob Harrington, Seattle - http://bobqat.com; Elliott Bay, WA; March 2002 photo (c) Â© Bob Harrington, Seattle - http://bobqat.com; Elliott Bay, WA; March 2002 photo (c) Karl KrÃ¤mer, via Werner Fischdick; Oshkosh-Wittman Field, WI (OSH); July 2001 photo (c) Harry S.

The pilot-flying carried out a go around, and the crew climbed the aircraft to a safe altitude to assess the situation. While circling north of the airport, the crew lowered the landing gear and determined the left main gear indicated unsafe. The emergency gear lowering procedure was carried out, and the crew visually confirmed the left main gear was extended although it was still indicating unsafe. The crew declared an emergency, and landed on runway 12. On touchdown the left main gear collapsed, and the aircraft came to a stop slightly left of the runway centreline.

After level off the relief pilot left the cockpit to begin his rest period. Within a few minutes he observed that the number 2 engine master warning light was illuminated, as well as a level 3 alert on the Engine and Alert Display and a red light on the number 2 fire handle and fuel shutoff lever. The fire bell did not activate. He and the first officer performed the memory and initial action items on the hard card checklists for an engine fire and shutdown the No. 2 engine. In addition, the captain discharged an engine fire bottle. The engine fire light continued to illuminate. The captain then fired a second engine fire bottle. The engine fire light continued to be illuminated. The captain requested that the relief pilot return to the cockpit. He then contacted  Air Traffic Control (ATC) and told them that their No. 2 engine was on fire and that they intended to land at the nearest suitable field. ATC responded that Charlotte was 35 miles away with a 10,000 foot runway. He asked for radar vectors and an immediate descent into Charlotte. They were given a lower altitude. The first officer initiated fuel dumping. The relief pilot returned to the cockpit and he asked the relief pilot and the first officer to run the checklists. As they descended the aircraft encountered heavy rain, light hail, and moderate turbulence. In addition, they observed a bright flash to the left of the nose, which might have been a lightning strike. As they completed the descent and approach checklists he told the crew to expect an emergency evacuation upon landing and directed the first officer to so inform the flight attendants. The aircraft was configured for an engine out approach and they reviewed the loss of a second engine procedure. The remainder of the approach, touchdown and landing roll occurred within normal parameters. He brought the airplane to a stop on the runway. The engine fire indication remained illuminated. The relief pilot stated they did not terminate fuel dumping prior to landing. They completed the items on the evacuation checklist. He then ordered an evacuation of the airplane. According to Delta Air Lines representatives, examination of the No. 2 engine by company maintenance personnel found one fire loop chafed through an adjacent cable, an integrated drive generator (IDG) feeder cable, inside the No. 2 engine cowling This allowed a direct 115 volt AC connection between the IDG and the fire detection control unit. The result was an electrical short and complete failure of the detection control unit that was indicated in the cockpit as a  fire warning. There was no evidence of fire in the No. 2 engine. Boeing Service  Bullettin MD11-71-086 was issued on May 21, 1996. The subject of the service bulletin was ""Power Plant - Electrical Harness - Replace/Modify Integrated Drive Generator (IDG) Wire Harness Support Brackets"". On May 21, 2001, Boeing elevated the service bulletin to the ""Alert"" level. Boeing recommended that aircraft operators accomplish the service bulletin within 1 year. According to Delta Air Lines personnel, in November 2001, Delta Air Lines Aircraft Engineering issued a Engineering Order to comply with Alert Service Bulletin MD11-71A086. The Engineering Order stated that all engines should be inspected and modified by November 2002. All three engines on the accident aircraft were inspected and modified in accordance with the Engineering Order on March 3, 2002. On March 28, 2002, the No. 2 engine was changed and the engine installed had not been modified by the Engineering Order.The Delta Airlines descent, approach, and before landing checklists dated June 30, 2000, and which were in use at the time of the accident, required the pilots to check the Engine and Alert Display. When fuel dumping is activated, a message is displayed on the Engine and Alert Display. Probable Cause: The failure of the aircraft operator to comply with, in a timely manner, on the No. 2 engine, Boeing Alert Service Bulletin MD11-71A086, resulting in the integrated drive generator feeder cable chaffing through a fire warning loop and failure of the fire warning system due to electrical damage. This resulted in a continuous indication in the cockpit of a No. 2 engine fire, an emergency descent and landing, and injuries to passengers during the subsequent emergency evacuation of the airplane.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: MIA02FA075 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources: NTSB MIA02FA075  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates25-Mar-2024 10:48 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

Air China flight 129 departed Beijing at 08:37 on a scheduled flight to Pusan-Gimhae in South Korea. The en route part of the flight was uneventful. At 11:06 the second officer contacted Gimhae Approach. At that moment the airplane was 32 nm from the airport at an altitude of FL170. The approach controller cleared the flight to descend to 6000 feet. Runway 36L was in use and the crew could expect a straight-in approach. at 11:09 the controller notified the crew that the runway was changed to 18R, with winds 210 degrees at 17 kts. This meant a circling approach which none of the crew members had flown yet at Pusan. The captain and first officer then discussed the approach to be flown. The captain cautioned: ""We won't enlarge the traffic pattern, the mountains are all over that side."" At 11:13 the flight was further cleared down to 2600 feet. Two minutes later the approach controller radioed: ""Air China 129, turn left heading 030 cleared for ILS DME runway 36L, then circle to runway 18 right, report field in sight."" At 11:17 they captured the ILS and were cleared further down to the circling altitude of 700 feet. The landing gear was extended and flaps set at 20 degrees. Then the controller instructed the flight to contact Gimhae Tower and to circle west. The second officer responded but did not read back the frequency change. The captain then instructed the first officer to disconnect the autopilot and turn left. From his position in the right hand seat the first officer was able to observe the runway. As the aircraft passed abeam the runway the autopilot was reengaged with heading select. At that moment the approach controller again contacted flight 129 instructing them to contact the tower. The crew were busy looking outside to see when they passed abeam the end of the runway. Simultaneously the Gimhae Tower controller contacted the flight using the emergency frequency. As they passed abeam the threshold at 11:20:02 they started timing to measure the commencement f turning to base. Eleven seconds after the call on the emergency frequency, the second officer reported to the Tower controller that they were on the circle approach. At 11:20:17 the captain took over control from the first officer and said he was going to turn base. He slowly began a widening turn, causing the first officer to urge him: ""turn quickly, not too late."" Meanwhile the flight was cleared to land . At 11:20:32 the captain disconnected the autopilot and banked the plane to the right. Twenty-two seconds later the first officer cautioned: ""Pay attention to the altitude keeping,"" and the captain asked him to help him get a visual on the runway. Due to the limited visibility they were not able to see the runway. The first officer then advised the captain to initiate a go around, but the captain did not respond. At 11:21:15 the first officer said, ""Pull up! Pull up!"" Pitch attitude was increased to 11.4 degrees but thrust was not increased. Two seconds later the aircraft impacted a mountain, about 4.6 km from the runway. FINDINGS RELATED TO PROBABLE CAUSES: 1. The flight crew of flight 129 performed the circling approach, not being aware of the weather minima of wide-body aircraft (B767-200) for landing, and in the approach briefing, did not include the missed approach, etc., among the items specified in Air ChinaÂs operations and training manuals. 2. The flight crew exercised poor crew resource management and lost situational awareness during the circling approach to runway 18R, which led them to fly outside of the circling approach area, delaying the base turn, contrary to the captainÂs intention to make a timely base turn. 3. The flight crew did not execute a missed approach when they lost sight of the runway during the circling approach to runway 18R, which led them to strike high terrain (mountain) near the airport. 4. When the first officer advised the captain to execute a missed approach about 5 seconds before impact, the captain did not react, nor did the first officer initiate the missed approach himself.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: KAIB Report number: KAIB/AAR F0201 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) Aviation Safety Network photo (c) Peter Frei; Berlin-SchÃ¶nefeld Airport (SXF); 09 July 1990 photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Beijing-Capital Airport (PEK); 18 October 1996 photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Beijing-Capital Airport (PEK); 30 March 1997 photo (c) Ralph Kunadt; Guangzhou-Baiyun Airport (CAN); 23 November 1991 photo (c) Alan Tsui; Hong Kong-Kai Tak International Airport (HKG); 21 November 1999 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates02-Jan-2025 10:51 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The captain briefed the lead flight attendant on the expected turbulence encounter and asked that the cabin be secured early with everyone, including the flight attendants, in their seats and secured.  A prearranged chime signal would notify the lead flight attendant that everyone should be in their seats.  After the chime signal, everyone was seated and secured; however, a flight attendant seated in the rear of the airplane noticed that a galley upper door compartment had come open.  This compartment was in line with both her head and another attendant's head, and she was concerned about objects coming out of the compartment during landing and injuring either one of them.  She unfastened her restraints, got up, and secured the door.  As she was returning to her seat, the airplane encountered a severe jolt, which violently slammed her into the ceiling, then the floor.

The crew was anticipating a visual approach to Runway 36 at Winnipeg International Airport but, because of conflicting traffic, accepted vectors for the instrument landing system (ILS) approach to Runway 13. At approximately 1908 central daylight time, the aircraft landed to the right of the runway centreline, then drifted further right and departed the runway surface, damaging a runway edge light, a taxiway edge light, and a runway identification sign. It then travelled 1150 feet through the infield and came to rest near the intersection of Runways 13/31 and 18/36. There were no reported injuries. The aircraft's left engine (Garrett TPE 33) sustained damage from ingested mud and vegetation. The right wing, left wing, and fuselage were damaged when the aircraft struck the edge lights and the runway identification sign. After the aircraft stopped, the crew shut down the engines and advised the Winnipeg Airport air traffic controller of their position.

The airplane was traveling in a predominately northern direction at 37,000 feet altitude during the encounter.   Weather products obtained showed that extreme intensity thunderstorms existed in the area where the turbulence was encountered.  Weather data and aircraft position radar data show that the airplane was 9 miles south-southwest of a cloud buildup that extended to 39,000 feet.  Additionally, the airplane was 5 miles west of an extreme intensity radar echo associated with the thunderstorms in the area.  The airline's General Operations Manual states that thunderstorms that are identified as severe, or giving a intense radar echo should be avoided by at least 20 miles.  No National Weather Service aviation weather advisories were in effect for the location and time of the turbulence encounter.  Communications transcripts show that the flight crew requested and were granted a course deviation for weather about 10 minutes prior to the upset. However, the Digital Flight Data Recorder shows that the seat belt sign was illuminated only 10 seconds prior to the encounter. Probable Cause: The flightcrew's failure to follow weather avoidance prcedures and their delay in activating the seat belt sign.   Factors were the turbulent thunderstorm weather conditions, and the failure of the National Weather Service to issue an applicable in-flight weather advisory.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CHI02LA111 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB CHI02LA111  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates25-Mar-2024 10:48 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

The flight was the third flight of eight flights planned for the day between Jayapura and Wamena. The en route part of the flight was uneventful and the pilot carried out an S-approach pattern for runway 15. Because the crew misjudged their distance to the runway they ended up being unable to decrease speed and extend flaps to landing configuration. With a high rate of descent the aircraft touched down. On touchdown the airplane bounced twice, the second and last bounce was reported to be more severe than the first one, causing the nose gear to collapse. The hydraulic system sustained damage, causing fluid to leak, which caught fire due to the friction of the aircraft on the runway. The captain applied reverse power and brakes, controlling the aircraft by using rudder inputs. The airplane decelerated with smoke emitting from the forward cargo compartment. After coming to a standstill, the loadmaster opened the airplane door taking the extinguisher, attempting to extinguish the fire. The airport fire truck could not be started, so the fire fighting personnel ran to the airplane carrying portable fire extinguishers. After twenty minutes the truck's battery had been recharged.

The flight was cleared to taxi at 12:01 hrs. The captain was pilot-non-flying and was seated in the right cockpit seat. During taxi, the crew completed their normal Before Takeoff Checks; these included confirmation that the control checks had been completed and that anti-ice might be required immediately after takeoff. Flap 20 had been selected for takeoff and the following speeds had been calculated and briefed by the pilots: V1 137 kt; VR 140 kt; V2 147 kt. By 12:06, the aircraft was cleared to line up on runway 15. At 12:07 hrs, N90AG was cleared for takeoff with a surface wind of 140Â°/8 kt. Takeoff appeared normal up to lift-off. Rotation was started at about 146 kt. Lift-off occurred 2 seconds later, at about 153 kt and with a pitch attitude of about 8 degrees nose-up. Immediately after lift-off, the aircraft started to bank to the left. The rate of bank increased rapidly and 2 seconds after lift-off the bank angle had reached 50 degrees. At that point, the aircraft heading had diverged about 10 degrees to the left. Opposite aileron, followed closely by right rudder, was applied as the aircraft started banking; full right aileron and full right rudder had been applied within 1 second and were maintained. As the bank angle continued to increase, progressively more aircraft nose-up elevator was applied. Stick-shaker operation initiated 3.5 seconds after lift-off. The left winglet contacted the runway shoulder, the outboard part of the left wing detached and the aircraft struck the ground inverted, structurally separating the forward fuselage. Fuel released from ruptured tanks ignited and the wreckage slid to a halt on fire. The last recorded aircraft attitude was approximately 111 degrees left bank and 13 degrees nose-down pitch. CAUSAL FACTORS: ""1. The crew did not ensure that N90AG's wings were clear of frost prior to takeoff.;  2. Reduction of the wing stall angle of attack, due to the surface roughness associated with frost contamination, to below that at which the stall protection system was effective.; 3. Possible impairment of crew performance by the combined effects of a non-prescription drug, jet-lag and fatigue.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: AAIB AAR 5-2004 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) aeroprints.com; Rantoul, KS; 30 April 2013; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane was prepared for the continuing flight to Batam. At 10:05 the First Officer asked for start clearance and received weather information. The weather was fine, wind calm and clear. After start-up was completed, the aircraft taxied to runway 18. The crew decided to use 'reduced take off power' with an assumed temperature of 35 deg. C, while the actual temperature was 27 deg. C. The First Officer acted as Pilot Flying. After being cleared for takeoff, the captain advanced the throttles and adjusted them to the required take off power setting. He then called the V1 and VR speeds and the First Officer pulled the control column to a 15 deg. nose up pitch. The aircraftÂs nose lifted up, but the aircraft did not become airborne. The stick shaker activated. The captain then added power and the speed increased to V2+15 (approx. 158 KIAS) but the aircraft still did not get airborne. The captain then decided to abort . He called 'stop', retarded the power levers to idle, applied reverse thrust, extended the speed brake and applied brakes. The nose of the aircraft touched down hard, causing the front left door (L1) to open and two trolleys at front galley to move forward, blocking the cockpit door. The flight crew turned the aircraft slightly to the right to avoid approach lights ahead. It hit some trees and stopped at approx. 275 meters from the end of runway. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""Since there is no indication that flaps system failure or flap asymmetry contributes in the failure of flap to travel to take-off configuration, the most probable cause for the failure is the improper execution of take-off checklist.

The aircraft climbed to its assigned cruising altitude of FL220, which was reached at 06:53. Permission to descend was given at 07:12 and at 07:23 the crew started an ILS approach to runway 30. Two minutes later the captain experienced control problems, which he attributed to an autopilot malfunction. An increase in the rate of descent went unnoticed by the crew who tried to find out the cause of the control problems. As the plane was descending over mountainous terrain, the GPWS alarm sounded three times. The approach controller then asked if the flight was established on the localizer and ILS glidepath. The copilot then replied that they had captured the localizer. Approach Control then instructed the crew to contact Bilbao Tower. Contact was not established however. The copilot noticed that they had not captured the glidepath and informed the captain. The airplaneÂ´s speed and rate of descent were reduced and a smooth climb was initiated. Six seconds later the airplane flew into the side of the Monte de Santa Marina, some 18 nm (33 km) from Bilbao Airport. The mountain has an altitude of 675 m (2215 ft).

During the initial descent the crew decided to deviate from the planned route because of thunderstorms along their planned route. At 16:19 the flight encountered an area of severe turbulence and thunderstorm activity with extremely heavy precipitation and hail. The crew attempted to fly towards a gap between two storm cells. About 90 seconds after entering the thunderstorm, as the airplane descended through about FL180 at a flight idle power setting, both engines flamed out. The crew carried out three unsuccessful attempts to restart the engines followed by one unsuccessful attempt to start the auxiliary power unit (APU). The flight crewÂs reported actions to restart the engines and APU however, were contrary to the procedures contained in the Boeing 737 Operations Manual. For instance, they waited only about 1 minute between each restart attempt instead of three minutes.  As the airplane descended below an overcast cloud layer at about 8,000 feet, the crew observed the Bengawan Solo River and decided to attempt to ditch the airplane into the river with flaps and landing gear in a shallow, 1 metre deep part of the river. One stewardess did not survive the crash.  Similar occurrences (Boeing 737-300 double engine flameout while descending in heavy precipitation with engines at flight idle) happened May 24, 1988 and July 26, 1988. Following these incidents OMB 88-5 and AD 6-14-88 were issued to require minimum rpm of 45% and to restrict the use of autothrust in moderate/heavy precipitation; engine modification was provided for increased capacity of water ingestion. Probable Cause: ""The NTSC determines that the probable causes of the accident were the combination of 1) The aircraft had entered severe hail and rain during weather avoidance which subsequently caused both engines flame out; 2) Two attempts of engine-relight failed because the aircraft was still in the precipitation beyond the enginesÂ certified capabilities; and 3) During the second attempt relight, the aircraft suffered run-out electrical power.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSC Report number: KNKT/02.02/06.01.33 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: Flight International  Jakarta Post  NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSC; near Yokyakarta; 16 January 2002 photo (c) NTSC; near Yokyakarta; 16 January 2002 photo (c) NTSC; near Yokyakarta; 16 January 2002 photo (c) Andy Martin; Jakarta-Soekarno-Hatta International Airport (CGK/WIII); 24 March 1990 photo (c) Alan Tsui; Singapore-Changi International Airport (SIN/WSSS); 04 April 1999 photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Denpasar-Ngurah Rai Bali International Airport (DPS/WADD); 03 April 1991 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The VFR flight was conducted at an altitude of 15,500 feet. At 10:50 the crew contacted the Nueva Loja Tower at Lago Agrio and reported near Olmedo. The Tower controller reported that runway 23 was in use and that the weather included a 6 knot wind at 020 degrees, temperature 29 degrees. The crew were then to have turned from 064 to 094 degrees, direct to Lago Agrio. They failed to do so and continued their present heading. After reporting 50 miles out at 10:59, they were cleared to descend. This was the last contact with the flight. The crew continued their descent until the airplane flew into the fog-shrouded side of El Tigre Mountain at an elevation of 11,916 feet. PROBABLE CAUSE (translated from Spanish): ""The Accident Investigative Board estimates that the probable cause of the accident was LOSS OF SITUATIONAL AWARENESS by the crew, since their attention was focused on aspects that were not related to the flight being executed and therefore neglecting the primary function of flight which is the control of the aircraft and decision making. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: - Crew failure to maintain a sterile cockpit - The continuous distraction of the crew throughout the flight - The lack of technical documentation in the CIA that supports the operation. - Lack of crew training in CRM, human factors and CFIT - The weather conditions at the time of the accident on Mount El Tigre made it impossible for the crew to see the mountain. - The lack of defence systems on the aircraft (GPWS ground proximity warning system)Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: DGAC Ecuador Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: El Universo  NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Quito-Mariscal Sucre Airport (UIO); 06 January 2000 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were no injuries.  The flight was destined for Atlanta, Georgia. According to the captain, the ramp was covered with snow and ice, and their gate position required a pushback with a nose swing of about 120 degrees. The airplane had an inoperative APU, and he elected to start both engines at the gate prior to pushback because a single engine crossbleed start would require an N1 of 80 percent on the operative engine. After both engines were started, the pushback was initiated. As the tug neared a 90 degree position to the right side of the nose of the airplane, it started to move forward, and then stopped when it struck the tug, after which the captain set the brakes. The captain added that he had not applied the brakes until after the airplane came to rest.  The tug driver reported that he had already pushed back two airplanes that morning with no problems, and that the initial part of the push was without incident. As the airplane entered an area where the ramp was icy, he turned the nose of the airplane to the west. The nosewheels on the airplane started slipping, and he was unable to communicate this to the cockpit crew. He stopped the tug and the airplane slid into the tug. Damage to the airplane consisted of a hole in the right side of the fuselage, located about 3 feet below the bottom of the forward, right side cabin door, and about 4 feet behind the trailing edge of the door. Internally, there was damage to the longerons. The lack of direction from the operator on how to perform pushbacks on an icy ramp, which led to the tug driver positioning the tug at an angle to the nose of the airplane that allowed the airplane to move forward and strike the tug. Factors were the inadequate visual lookout by the walker wearing the headset, and the icy ramp.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NYC02LA056 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  3 May 1972 TC-JAB TÃ¼rk Hava Yollari - THY 0 Sofia unk Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were 87 passengers and six crew members on board. Three cabin attendants sustained minor injuries. All Nippon Airways flight 391 took off from Nagoya Airport (NGO) at 11:53 on a regular domestic flight to Hakodate. After beginning descent from cruise altitude, the aircraft was radar vectored onto the final approach course by the Hakodate Approach Control, and commenced an ILS runway 12 approach at Hakodate Airport. During the approach, the captain assumed the duties of Pilot Not Flying (PNF) while the first officer assumed Pilot Flying (PF) duties. The aircraft encountered light turbulence during the approach. Hakodate Airport Tower reported the wind for runway 12 as 130Â°/28 kt, a strong and slightly right crosswind. Although the approach course and flight path angle of aircraft were both normal during the approach, the aircraftÂs wind shear warning system issued an aural wind shear warning at around 140 m from the runway threshold, at an altitude of 53 ft above ground level (AGL) while the aircraft was flying over the approach lights for runway 12. Although the crew initiated a go-around to recover from the wind shear, the aircraftÂs aft fuselage contacted the runway and as a result substantial damage was sustained. The aircraft continued to go around for recovery from the wind shear after contacted aft fuselage with the runway. The crew made another ILS approach to runway 12, and landed at Hakodate Airport at around 13:21 uneventfully. An external check after arrival found that damage had been sustained to the lower surface of the aft fuselage. PROBABLE CAUSES In this accident, it is estimated that while on final approach at a height of approximately 100ft AGL, the aircraft encountered severe wind shear and although recovery actions were taken, a sufficient rate of ascent was not attained in time to prevent the lower surface of the aft fuselage striking the runway, resulting in damage to rear frames and the aft pressure bulkhead. Further, the following factors are considered to have contributed to this accident: (1) A delay in engine thrust response to the thrust levers being advanced to recover from the wind shear, combined with a reduced approach speed, meant that an increase in speed could not be obtained immediately. These factors contributed to the fact that sufficient rate of ascent could not be attained in time to prevent the tail strike. (2) Factors contributing to the reduced approach speed were the fact that the first officer, acting as PF, had selected a slightly low value for the final approach speed, and that he reduced thrust in response to an increase in headwind. (3) Factors in the reduction of engine thrust in response to the increase in headwind were because the pilot was operating the thrust levers manually in ""SELECTED SPEED"" mode he was attempting to maintain a constant CAS, and that the flight crew had not adequately anticipated a increasing followed by a continuing drop in wind speed. (4) Regarding the selection of a slightly low value for final approach speed, appropriate consideration was not given to wind speed, and there were concerns over touch down attitude related to high approach speeds. (5) Regarding the fact that appropriate consideration was not given to wind speed, the first officer used a simple calculation formula that did not separately consider the additional airspeed margins to take account of wind speed changes and the head wind component, but that treated these together. (6) Regarding the concerns over aircraft touch down attitude at high approach speeds, the measures described in the operatorÂs AOM for dealing with a nose-down attitude assumed only the case of full flap landings, and the First Officer considered difficulty to land an aircraft with a nose-down attitude. It is considered possible that the low-level wind shear had originated due the effects of ground topography on the surface boundary layer under conditions of strong winds accompanied by gusts.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ARAIC Report number: 2003-5 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ  History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  30 March 2008 AP-BRJ Airblue 0 Lahore, min Images: photo (c) JTSB; Hakodate Airport (HKD/RJCH); January 2002 photo (c) isamuel; Akita Airport (AXT/RJSK); 09 October 2004 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane was positioned near the end of the runway with the engines shut down during an air traffic control delay.   After approximately 15 minutes, the flightcrew was informed by ground control that they should start their engines, as they would probably be released for takeoff soon.  The captain reported they were unable to start the right engine.  They performed the ""clearing procedure"" and then went on to start the left engine with no problem.  They then attempted to start the right engine again.    Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) personnel were parked near the airplane reported to air traffic control that there were smoke and flames coming from the right engine.  There were no fire warning indications in the cockpit.  The flightcrew performed the ENGINE FIRE checklist and subsequently discharged both fire suppressant bottles into the engine.  The flightcrew eventually shut down both engines and ARFF requested that the flightcrew begin evacuating the airplane.   All of the passengers were directed to the front of the airplane and the evacuation took place using the 1L and 1R doors.  A witness reported that the injured passenger stepped out of the airplane onto the slide.  The passenger bounced down the slide and went over the side of the slide approximately four to five feet above the ground.  The investigation revealed the engine start fuel scheduling for the Fuel Control Unit was high.  In addition, the ignition exciter box and igniter plugs were tested.  The ignition exciter box was found to operate intermittently on the D.C. circuit which would be used for engine start. Probable Cause: The passenger fell off the side of the slide during the emergency evacuation.  Factors were the emergency evacuation and the erratic ignition exciter.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CHI02LA069 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB CHI02LA069  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates25-Mar-2024 10:54 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

TAME Flight 120 was a scheduled flight from Quito to Cali, Colombia via TulcÃ¡n. The Boeing 727 took off from runway 17 at 10:03 for the first leg to TulcÃ¡n. The flight climbed to the cruising altitude of FL180 and proceeded on the G-675 airway towards Ipiales from where it was to turn to TulcÃ¡n. At 10:15 the flight contacted TulcÃ¡n Tower. At that moment the airplane was 29 miles from the TulcÃ¡n NDB. The crew received permission to descend to FL140 and was given the current weather information, which included 8000 metres visibility, few clouds at 200 metres and overcast at 500 metres. The approach procedure called for a speed of 180 kts, but the actual speed was much higher at 230 knots. During the descent the airplane flew into the side of the Nevado el Cumbal Volcano at 14,700 feet, 1400 feet below the summit. PROBABLE CAUSE (translated from Spanish): 1) The decision of the instructor captain and his crew to initiate and continue the operation towards Tulcan airport below the meteorological minima established in the company's SOPs.  2) Inadequate navigation and operation of the aircraft by the pilot flying and directed by the instructor captain, consisting of entering the holding pattern of the Tulcan radio beacon with a speed of 230 knots indicated airspeed and with a banking of 15 degrees exceeding the maximum stipulated speed limit of 180 knots  during the entire procedure including the holding pattern and using a banking below the recommended range of 25 to 30 degrees, thus exceeding the lateral navigation and obstacle protection limits of the holding pattern, leading this operation to the collision with El Cumbal Hill.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Aerocivil Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: El Universo   Location  Images: photo (c) Jesper Venema photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Quito-Mariscal Sucre Airport (UIO/SEQU) [HC]; 06 January 2000 photo (c) Ariel Corridor; Quito-Mariscal Sucre Airport (UIO/SEQU); 15 August 1991 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates02-Jan-2025 09:00 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Shortly before impact, the mishap crew was conducting a simulated single-engine approach to runway 31 at Ellsworth AFB. Subsequent analysis showed that there was a significantly greater amount of fuel in the left wing and left wing tip tank than the right. The gross fuel imbalance resulted from an unmonitored transfer of fuel from the right wing and right wing tip tank to the left that was initiated by the crew approximately nine and one-half minutes before impact. As the aircraft approached the point when it would normally transition to a flare, it leveled off and began a climbing turn to the west, toward the tower. It did not touch down prior to the turn, but veered left immediately during the flare, and then rolled back to wings level momentarily as it climbed. The heavier left wing, and application of power to the right engine for the go-around, caused the aircraft to roll back into a steeper left turn, stayed in a climbing left turn with the bank continuing to increase until il rolled through more than 90 degrees of bank. As the aircraft reached the highest point of the climb (approximately 450 feet), the bank angle was more than 90 degrees, and perhaps slightly inverted as the nose dropped and the aircraft began to descend. The aircraft impacted the ground in a grassy field. The accident investigation board president found clear and convincing evidence that the primary cause of the mishap was the crew's failure to follow flight manual procedures for fuel transfer. As a result, the mishap aircraft experienced a fuel imbalance significant enough to cause the aircraft to enter an unsafe roll to the left from which the pilot was not able to recover.Sources: US Department of Defense  USAAS-USAAC-USAAF-USAF Aircraft Serial Numbers--1908 to Present / Joe Baugher   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

The airplane was on jacks, for a tire change, when a mechanic needed access to the airplane's Maintenance Data Acquisition Unit (MDAU) to check out the problem that the airplane was having regarding false over speed warnings. Since the airplane was on jacks the mechanic had to disable the weight-on-wheel (WOW) switches in order to simulate that the WOW was in the ground mode, not in the air mode, and to gain access to the MDAU. The mechanic said he used a ""Popsicle stick"" to disable these switches. After the maintenance was completed the sticks were not removed, and the inspector that returned the airplane to service was not aware that the WOW switches had been disabled for any reason and no notation was mentioned in the work logs.  The aircraft was to be ferried back to Teterboro and shortly after takeoff the landing gear failed to retract. Despite several attempts the crew did not succeed in raising the gear. They elected to land, to evaluate the situation on the ground, and performed an ILS approach back to runway 27R. Shortly before touchdown the power levers were retarded to idle. At that point the spoilers deployed and the aircraft suddenly and abruptly descended to the runway with a very hard, 4.25 g, landing. The right main gear was pushed through the wing causing spilling of fuel on the runway. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""Maintenance personnel's failure to remove wooden sticks from the landing gear weight-on-wheel switches resulting in the airplane remaining in ground mode, and the in flight deployment of the spoilers when the flight crew moved the power levers to idle, during the landing flare, resulting in a hard landing.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: MIA02LA060 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 years and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

After departure, at an altitude of 15,000 feet, the flight was operating in and out of clouds.  The pilot reported that he was not receiving any significant weather radar returns ahead of the airplane.  However, as he cleared a layer of clouds, he observed a cumulus cloud that was ahead of the airplane.  The cloud was too close to avoid and he flew through the top of the cloud.  While in the cloud, the airplane encountered turbulence which threw a flight attendant located in the rear of the airplane into the air, and he subsequently fell and fractured his ankle.  The captain had briefed the crew prior to departure, but did not include any specific comments about delaying the start of cabin service until clear of the thunderstorms, nor was he specifically required to.  The airline had no written direction for the flight attendants to know when they could leave their seats and begin cabin service. Probable Cause and Findings An inadvertent encounter with convective induced turbulence, which injured a flight attendant. Factors were the failure of the airline to supply direction to the flight crew to indicate when the flight attendants could begin cabin service, and the convective induced turbulence.

The runway controller at Changi Tower instructed the aircraft to park at Bay 117, a remote aircraft parking bay. The ground movement planner at Changi Tower selected the taxiway centre line lights to guide the aircraft along Taxiway WA to Bay C7 (Bay 117 is the second parking bay after Bay C7). Instead of stopping at the end of its assigned taxi route, the aircraft continued taxiing past Bay C7 along a diverted portion of Taxiway WA. At about 00:37 hours, the aircraft called Changi Tower to indicate its position near Bay 106. Realising that the aircraft had missed its assigned parking position, the ground movement planner at Changi Tower reselected the taxiway centre line lights to guide the aircraft back to Bay 117. The aircraft followed the return route until it was abeam Bay 117 on the straight section of the diverted portion of Taxiway WA. At that location, the pilot saw the ground marshaller in position at Bay 117 on the aircraftÂs right side. Instead of continuing to follow the taxiway centre line lights on the assigned taxi route, the aircraft turned right. In doing so, it left the Taxiway WA centre line and went onto a grass area between Taxiway WA and the parking apron. The nose gear of the aircraft went across a drain within the grass area. The aircraft came to a halt when its main landing gears went into the drain at about 00:44 hours. Contributory Factors - The runway controller was not aware of the requirement for aircraft to be towed into Bay 117. He instructed flight APWP6L to follow the green lights to Bay 117 in accordance with standard ATC procedures. -  The flight crew did not notice on the Jeppesen charts that there was a turf island separating Taxiway WA from the parking apron where Bay 117 was located.  - As taxiway centre line lights were provided along Taxiway WA, according to ICAO Annex 14, there was no requirement for taxiway edge lights to be provided. However, where there is a large unmarked paved area adjacent to a taxiway, the provision of taxiway edge lights or reflective markers (in addition to taxiway centre line lights) would provide an additional cue to pilots to stay within the taxiway. This may help to prevent pilots inadvertently straying off the taxiway. - There were no edge lights or markers to show the grass area between Taxiway WA and the parking apron where Bay 117 was located. There is no requirement in ICAO Annex 14 for edge lights or markers to show the presence of grass areas adjacent to taxiways. - The drain located within the grass area between the diverted portion of Taxiway WA and the parking apron was outside the taxiway strip. According to ICAO Annex 14, drains located outside a taxiway strip are not required to be covered.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Singapore Report number: AIB/AAI/CAS.004 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Approximately one hour into the flight, while the aircraft was in cruise at flight level 330 (FL330), the crew experienced the sudden onset of heavy airframe vibration and received an ENG 3 REVERSER annunciation from the engine indicating and crew alerting system (EICAS). The crew initially reduced the no.3 engine power and carried out the 'Engine Reverser Unlocked' actions from the aircraft quick-reference handbook (QRH). The crew stated that the engine appeared to be functioning normally at that time. After further EICAS status and advisory messages however, the crew elected to carry out other QRH checklists, concluding with the shutdown of the no. 3 engine. The captain made a PAN call to air traffic control and subsequently an advisory announcement to the passengers. To reduce airframe vibration after the engine was shut down, the first officer, who was the handling pilot, descended the aircraft to FL180 and reduced airspeed. A third crew member who was resting at the time of the event went back into the cabin to examine the engines and found extensive damage to the no. 3 engine nacelle and strut fairings. After that information was reported to the flight crew, a further QRH checklist Fire Engine, Severe Damage or Separation was actioned, although at no time was there any reported indication or sign of fire. A decision to return to Sydney was made and fuel was jettisoned to establish a landing weight within limits. In consideration of the damage to the engine and to minimise the risk should the engine or components separate, an over-water approach to runway 34L was requested. The aircraft landed safely at 19:47. Significant Factors: 1. During the 1991 manufacture of the first-stage low-pressure compressor blade serial number GB77535, a small area of incomplete bonding remained within the interface between the two titanium alloy plates used to fabricate the blade component. 2. The presence of the incompletely bonded region was detected during preliminary non-destructive inspection, however the blade was accepted for service under the manufacturer's 'concessional assessment' program. 3. The maximum acceptable bond-line defect size limits as specified by the concessional assessment program were too large to ensure that fatigue cracks could not initiate and propagate to failure within the prescribed life limit of the blade components. 4. None of the manufacturer's prescribed periodic in-service inspections carried out on the blade during its life had detected the incomplete bond defect. None of these inspections were specifically designed for the detection of defects within the lower aerofoil section where the defect was located. 5. Fatigue cracking initiated and propagated from the upper edge of the bond-line defect in response to service loading conditions. 6. Fracture and release of the fan aerofoil section from the rotor occurred after growth of the cracking to critical size. 7. The number-3 engine failed from damage sustained during the blade failure event. 8. The aircraft sustained minor airframe and number-4 engine damage resulting from impacts with blade debris liberated from the number-3 engine nacelle and cowling.Sources: ATSB  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were no injuries, but the aircraft sustained substantial damage. The scheduled domestic passenger flight was preparing to depart for Chicago-O'Hare International Airport, Illinois. After completing de-icing procedures on a company Boeing 757-200, the driver of the de-icing truck maneuvered his truck in a manner that caused the de-icing basket boom to impact the trailing edge of the aircraft's left aileron. The boom penetrated the aileron to a depth of almost two feet and damaged its spar. The investigation revealed that while backing out from his position behind the aircraft's left wing, the driver had inadvertently turned his steering wheel in a direction that caused the boom, which is mounted on the back end of the truck, to converge on the trailing edge of the aileron. The failure of the deicing truck driver to insure that the deicing basket boom remained clear of the aircraft structure as he backed away from the position he had been in while performing deicing procedures.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: SEA02LA049 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

He had difficulty locating the airstrip due to ice fog and reduced visibility, and initially flew over the top of the runway.  A passenger saw the airstrip, and about the same time, the camp operator radioed the pilot that the airplane had just passed the camp.  The pilot made a descent and an approach to the airstrip, but the airplane stalled and collided with terrain about 1/4 mile short of the runway.  The camp operator noted that at the time of the accident there was ice fog in the area, and a portion of the runway was not visible due to the fog.  He estimated the horizontal visibility to be about 3/4 of a mile.  Postaccident inspection of the airplane disclosed approximately 1/2 inch of ice on the airplane's left lift strut and main landing gear leg.  The pilot said after the accident that either a cabin door or cargo pod door may have opened during the approach.  Postaccident inspection, and interviews with passengers, disclosed no evidence of an in-flight cargo or cabin door opening, and crush lines on the cargo pod door are consistent with the door being closed at impact. Probable Cause: The pilot's continued flight into adverse weather conditions, and an inadvertent stall.

The four crew members and thirty passengers were not injured.  AA334 departed gate Alpha 14 at 06:33, and taxied to ramp spot 22 for de-icing. The aircraft was parked at a northeast direction. The ground de-icing crew notified the flight crew to prepare for de-icing. Approximately ten minutes after de-icing began, the captain reported that he heard and felt a ""thud-like"" noise from outside the aircraft. At the same time, the APU shutdown. One of the de-icing crewmembers on the ground stated he saw a flame come from the APU exhaust and discharged the ground APU fire bottle. Approximately the same time, the #2 flight attendant who was seated in the jumpseat at the rear of the cabin, phoned the captain via the intercom and informed him that the emergency first aid kit sustained damage in the form of a three-inch hole in the back of the kit. The flight attendant stated that an apparent impact on the first aid kit had propelled it from the stowed position into the center aisle of the aircraft. The rear cabin jumpseat was located directly in front of the aft pressure bulkhead. The emergency first aid kit was stowed directly onto the aft wall of the cabin underneath the rear cabin jumpseat. Two spray trucks were used to de-ice the airplane with Type 1 de-icing fluid. The five-person crew consisted of a checker, a driver for each truck, and a spray bucket operator for each truck. The members of the de-icing crew stated that at the time they were de-icing the airplane, the wind was blowing at 20 knots and gusting. Due to the windy conditions, the drivers of the de-icing trucks had coordinated prior to de-icing the airplane to start at opposite ends of the airplane so the bucket operators would not be spraying each other as they de-iced the airplane. The bucket operators both stated that at times, the wind was whipping the stream of de-icing fluid such that they could not even see the airplane, let alone where the de-icing fluid was being sprayed. Bucket operator #1 stated that he had completed de-icing the nose, right wing, and right horizontal stabilizer of the airplane, and had just started to de-ice the right side of the vertical fin, when he heard a noise and saw that the APU was on fire. Bucket operator #2 stated that he had de-iced the left horizontal stabilizer, the left side of the vertical fin, and aft fuselage, and after the truck was repositioned, he had started to de-ice the left wing when the checker discovered the APU fire. The bucket operators stated that they knew where the F-100's APU air inlet was located, and were aware that de-icing fluid should not be sprayed into the APU inlet.  The Automated Surface Observing Station for DFW at 0700 reported winds from 320 degrees at 20 knots gusting to 27 knots, visibility 2.5 statute miles in freezing rain and ice pellets, overcast skies at 2,500 feet, temperature minus 4 degrees Celsius, dew point minus six degrees Celsius, and an altimeter setting of 30.01 inches of Mercury.  Examination of the airplane revealed APU damage, which was located inside the tailcone. The turbine wheel was found fractured into five pieces. The fracture surfaces were coarse and grainy, with no evidence of fatigue. The impeller was found intact and the impeller vane leading edges had nicks and gouges and were bent opposite the direction of rotation. Ridges on the rear face of the impeller were in line with the vanes on the front face. A fragment of the turbine wheel penetrated the aft pressure bulkhead, and was found embedded in the first aid kit that was stored directly underneath the flight attendant's aft jump seat located at the rear of the cabin. Examination of the APU was conducted at American Airlines' maintenance facility in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The examination revealed two large holes in the APU's compressor case in line with the turbine wheel's plane of rotation. The turbine wheel was broken into several pieces. The broken pieces of the turbine wheel were submitted to Honeywell's Materials Laboratory for a metallurgical examination that confirmed the APU had experienced an overspeed. Further examination did not reveal evidence of fatigue on any of the fracture surfaces. Additionally, the containment ring was broken into three pieces.  The APU has an electronic control unit (ECU) that meters fuel to the APU while it is in operation. The ECU monitors the rotor speed and will shut off fuel to the APU if it senses an overspeed, which is 107 percent. The ECU was removed from the engine and shipped to Honeywell's Anniston, Alabama facility to interrogate the ECU's non-volatile memory (NVM) and perform a diagnostic test. The NVM indicated that the APU had experienced an overspeed, which is a rotor speed of 107 percent or greater, and had commanded a shutdown. The diagnostic test showed that there were no discrepancies with the ECU. A review of American Airlines' de-icing training program showed that each of the 5 had completed annual refresher training in de-icing procedures for the F-100. During de-icing training, personnel are advised not to spray the F-100 APU inlet area, and crews are furnished diagrams of each type of airplane that highlight prohibited spray areas. In February 2001, American Airlines issued a 'Winterization Bulletin' for the F-100 advising that de-ice spray should not be sprayed into the APU inlet. Additionally, the F-100 maintenance manual section 12-31-00, page 301 specifically advises, ""Do not let de-icing and/or anti-icing fluid/water mixture go into the APU inlet. Injury to persons and/or damage to equipment can occur."" American Airlines' policy had been to operate the APU during de-icing. As a result of this event, pilots were instructed to not operate the APU during de-icing operations, and to refer to the operating manual and follow procedures for de-icing with an inoperative APU. De-icing crews were also informed of the change in de-icing procedures, regarding the operation of the APU. As a result of this event, on March 29, 2002, the National Transportation Safety Board issued Safety Recommendation A-02-05 that recommended the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) immediately issue an airworthiness directive (AD) for the Fokker F-28 MK-100 and F-28 MK-4000 airplanes that prohibits APU operation during de-icing operations. The FAA issued AD 2001-07-03 that prohibits the operation of the APU during de-icing operations for all series of the F-28 airplane. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The ground crew inadvertent application of de-icing fluid in the auxiliary power unit resulting in an overspeed and turbine wheel burst. A contributing factor was the gusty wind.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: FTW02LA088 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The first officer commenced the takeoff roll, using a decision speed of 107 kt. All appeared normal until 100 kt when the first officer glanced down and saw the red 'Doors' warning caption illuminate. He immediately called ""STOP STOP STOP"" and rejected the takeoff, bringing the aircraft to a complete halt on the runway. During the deceleration, the audio warning sounded. Once the aircraft was stationary the commander vacated his seat to check the situation in the passenger cabin whilst the first officer contacted ATC to inform them of the emergency. The commander returned to his seat, shut down the left hand engine and taxied to an allocated stand where the passengers were deplaned from a rear door. CONCLUSIONS: ""The most probable cause of the accident was that the senior cabin attendant grasped the inner door handle to restrain her upper body during the rapid acceleration of the aircraft. The ergonomics of the cabin crew seat and door handle made such an involuntary action readily conceivable. Such action lead to the door unlatching and opening rapidly. Failure of the damper attachments and disruption of the banister mechanism then allowed forcible over-travel, leading to failure of the airstair attachment arms. The remaining attachment strength of the door and airstairs to the aircraft was such that both would almost certainly have separated had the aircraft become airborne. Had separation occurred, the port propeller and other critical parts of the aircraft would probably have been struck. A catastrophic outcome could not be ruled out. The door and airstair design, though technically complying with the certification requirements, lacked the necessary integrity to prevent a hazardous occurrence to the aircraft.""Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  20 February 2005 G-BWIR ScotAirways 0 London City Airport (LCY) non Runway excursion Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

None of the 3 crewmembers or 50 passengers on board was injured. The airplane sustained damage to the number-two engine inlet, the first officer's windshield, and a 14- by 4-inch section of fuselage skin just below the windshield seal on the first officer's side.  The captain reported that the airplane was on departure roll and had accelerated past 80 knots when a flock of birds began to fly south over the runway. The airplane was traveling at approximately 110 knots when one of the birds hit the airplane, cracking the first officer's windshield and causing a few shards of glass to fall into the cockpit and onto the first officer. The captain immediately rejected the takeoff and stopped on the runway to assess the damage.  A postflight inspection by maintenance personnel revealed that the airplane had struck two wild turkeys. One turkey hit the intake of the number-two engine, slightly damaging the forward lip of the engine intake cowl. No bird remains went through the engine. The other turkey hit just below the first officer's windshield, where a turkey leg and foot were still lodged. Closer examination of the airplane revealed that the second turkey hit the nose sheet metal at the base of the first officer's windshield, bending the windshield support structure and causing the windshield to crack upward from that location. The second turkey penetrated the area beneath the lower support structure, went through the pressure bulkhead, and entered the back of the instrument panel but did not penetrate either the windshield or its supporting structure.

According to the flight plan the track would over fly Split, Pescara, the crossing of the Apennines towards Ostia and then onwards its destination, Tunis. The meteorological conditions over the central part of Italy on that March the 9th were characterized by a cold front associated with numerous thunderstorm areas, low cloud coverage over the mountainous Apennines accompanied by icing conditions. After leaving Split, and crossing the Adriatic sea LY-AVD over flew Pescara at 13:20 where the pilot informed the local ATC that the aircraft was inbound Aneda (a reporting point 19 NM East of Monte Rotondo) at a cruising altitude of 5.500 feet (1.676 m). While in vicinity of Pescara, ATC requested and obtained confirmation from LY-AVD that VFR conditions were maintainable. The radio communication ended with the instruction to LY-AVD to contact Rome AIS Centre. There is no record of communication attempt by the crew and it is presumed that the aircraft, soon after that radio communication, impacted with the Monte Rotondo mountain side at an altitude of 6.167 feet (1.880 m) with an estimated ground speed of 115 Kts. DIRECT CAUSES: ""Analysis of available evidence make it reasonable to classify the event investigated as an unintentional terrain impact, Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT). At accident time, because of the reduced visibility, incompatible with VFR flying, the crew could not evaluate correctly the orography of the area along there route. It has to be noted that it was not possible to ascertain if adequate maps were available to the crew showing the exact position of ground relief and obstacles. It was not possible to determine if the pilots had flown across the same area in the past. Given the meteorological conditions over the area, the crew did not conform to the Visual Flying Rules that mandated for a track change to maintain the required flight parameters (visibility/clearance from obstacles) and/or a diversion to a suitable alternate airport (as international rules mandate)."" CONTRIBUTORY FACTORS: ""Analysis of available evidence suggests that the following may be considered as contributory factors to the accident. The prevailing meteorological conditions existing on March 9, 2002 over the flight path of LY-AVD across the central part of Italy did not allow for the flight to be continued under VFR. The Antonov AN2 was not fit for flying in low visibility (IMC) and was not equipped for flying in icing conditions. The pilot of the LY-AVD did not hold the required English language radio-telephony (RT) qualification to operate outside the country of licensing. The pilot of the LY-AVD did not hold an IFR qualification (for flying in IMC).""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ANSV Report number: A/2/03 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Soviet Transports  ANSV   Location  Images: photo (c) JP; Monte Rotondo; 07 September 2011 photo (c) JP; Monte Rotondo; 07 September 2011 photo (c) JP; Monte Rotondo; 07 September 2011 photo (c) JP; Monte Rotondo; 07 September 2011 photo (c) JP; Monte Rotondo; 07 September 2011 photo (c) JP; Monte Rotondo; 07 September 2011 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Flight crew interview statements indicated that they were preparing for turbulence and that they wanted the passengers and flight attendants seated with their seatbelts fastened.  However, the flight crew did not advise the lead flight attendant (LFA) of the turbulence level and its anticipated duration nor did they use turbulence codes, as stipulated in Northwest Airlines' Flight Operations Manual. The investigation also revealed that the LFA did not relay the turbulence information to all of the flight attendants, as stipulated in the company's Flight Attendant Manual.   Examination of the restraint system from the injured flight attendant's jump seat indicated that the restraint system did not fail during the turbulence upset. The Safety Board was unable to determine whether the lapbelt was improperly secured by the flight attendant or whether it was inadvertently disengaged during the turbulence upset.  The Safety Board's investigation examined the turbulence and the flight crew's operation of the airplane during the turbulence encounter to evaluate the effects on the airplane occupants.  Analysis of the flight data recorder (FDR) data indicates that the turbulence caused substantial vertical and lateral oscillations, which may have made it difficult for the first officer (as the flying pilot) to maintain a constant pitch attitude.   The FDR data showed variations in the airplane's pitch attitude during the turbulence encounter. Despite the airplane's pitch excursions, statements from the flight crew indicate that they were attempting to maintain constant pitch attitudes during the turbulence upset.  Nevertheless, FDR data indicate that the large and rapid pitch excursions were primarily a result of control column inputs made by the first officer.  The Safety Board's investigation determined that the main pitchover (which likely caused the flight attendant's injuries) occurred as a result of the first officer's control inputs.  Probable Cause: The flight attendant's injuries were a result of her unsecured lap belt and shoulder harness for undetermined reasons, and the oscillations of the airplane, which were caused by turbulence and large control column inputs by the first officer.  Contributing to the flight attendant's injuries was the failure of the flight crew and the lead flight attendant to follow company procedures regarding dissemination of turbulence information.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA02MA029 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA02MA029 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  10 October 2000 N234NW Northwest Airlines 0 120 nm from Paris non Prop/turbine blade separation Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates25-Mar-2024 10:53 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The two flight crew members and four passengers were uninjured.  The captain, who was also the company chief pilot and check airman, was the flying pilot, and the first officer was the non flying pilot. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. Area weather reporting stations reported the presence of freezing rain and snow for a time period beginning several hours before the accident. The captain did not obtain the destination airport weather observation until the flight was approximately 30 nautical miles from the airport. The flight received radar vectors for a instrument landing system approach to runway 30 (5,401 feet by 100 feet, grooved asphalt). The company's training manual states the MU-300's intermediate and final approach speeds as 140 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS) and Vref, respectively. Vref was reported by the flight crew as 106 KIAS. During the approach, the tower controller gave the option for the flight to circle to land or continue straight in to runway 30. He advised that the winds were from 050-070 degrees at 10 knots gusting to 20 knots, and runway braking action was reported as fair to poor by a snow plow.  Radar data indicates that the airplane had a ground speed in excess of 200 knots between the final approach fix and runway threshold and a full-scale localizer deviation 5.5 nm from the localizer antenna.  The aircraft appeared to be decelerating normal, according to the captain, until approximately the 3,000 foot marker. At that point the aircraft's deceleration slowed down and the aircraft began to skid. Approaching the end of the runway the captain noticed a drop off at beyond the end of the runway. The visibility was not good enough to determine what was beyond the drop-off. The captain decided to turn the aircraft to minimize the forward speed after exiting runway and to avoid going down the hill. The aircraft came to rest 30 feet beyond the departure end to the right of centerline. The company did not have stabilized approach criteria establishing when a missed approach or go-around is to be executed. The captain stated that he was unaware that there was 0.7 percent downslope on runway 30. The company provided a page from their airport directory which did not indicate a slope present for runway 30. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""Missed approach not executed and flight to a destination alternate not performed by the flight crew. The tail wind and snow/ice covered runway were contributing factors.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CHI02FA097 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft was restored to original condition with Pan American Airlines livery, carrying the name ""Clipper Flying Cloud"". On March 28, 2002 the aircraft took off from Boeing Field for a local flight around 12:30. The crew were to practice takeoffs and landings and shake out any mechanical problems. Both pilots were planning to do three takeoffs and landings each, with a refueling stop in between. The first pair were uneventful, with the plane flying from Boeing Field to Everett-Paine Field. On takeoff there, at 12:51, the No. 3 engine surged briefly. It returned to normal, but the pilots decided to abort the rest of the practice and return to Boeing Field. On approach it appeared that the left-main landing gear had not locked down. The approach was aborted and the plane circled Vashon and Bainbridge islands as the flight mechanic manually cranked the wheel into the locked position. The pilot then resumed its approach. The airplane was about 6 miles from the runway when fuel pressure for the number three engine dropped below minimum. The boost pumps were turned on; however, fuel pressure did not recover, and the engine lost power. The low fuel pressure light then illuminated for the number four engine. The captain commanded the flight engineer to switch fuel feed to another tank. The flight engineer's response was, ""There is no other tank. We're out of fuel."" The captain pushed the throttles forward and called for the number three engine to be feathered. When the throttles were pushed forward, multiple engine surges occurred. Then the surging stopped, and it appeared that the remaining engines had also lost power. The airplane was rapidly losing altitude and the captain decided to ditch in Elliott Bay. After landing, the airplane remained afloat while the crew evacuated. They were quickly picked up by rescue boats. The airplane was subsequently towed to shallower water by a Seattle Police Department boat before it partially sank in the water just offshore. The day after the accident, the aircraft was lifted from the water. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""Loss of all engine power due to fuel exhaustion that resulted from the flight crew's failure to accurately determine onboard fuel during the pre-flight inspection.  A factor contributing to the accident was a lack of adequate crew communication regarding the fuel status.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: SEA02FA060 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: AP  NTSB  Seattle Times  Images: photo (c) Scott Cronk, Seattle - http://www.noontimenet.com; Elliott Bay, WA; March 2002 photo (c) Scott Cronk, Seattle - http://www.noontimenet.com; Elliott Bay, WA; March 2002 photo (c) Â© Bob Harrington, Seattle - http://bobqat.com; Elliott Bay, WA; March 2002 photo (c) Â© Bob Harrington, Seattle - http://bobqat.com; Elliott Bay, WA; March 2002 photo (c) Karl KrÃ¤mer, via Werner Fischdick; Oshkosh-Wittman Field, WI (OSH); July 2001 photo (c) Harry S.

The pilot-flying carried out a go around, and the crew climbed the aircraft to a safe altitude to assess the situation. While circling north of the airport, the crew lowered the landing gear and determined the left main gear indicated unsafe. The emergency gear lowering procedure was carried out, and the crew visually confirmed the left main gear was extended although it was still indicating unsafe. The crew declared an emergency, and landed on runway 12. On touchdown the left main gear collapsed, and the aircraft came to a stop slightly left of the runway centreline.

After level off the relief pilot left the cockpit to begin his rest period. Within a few minutes he observed that the number 2 engine master warning light was illuminated, as well as a level 3 alert on the Engine and Alert Display and a red light on the number 2 fire handle and fuel shutoff lever. The fire bell did not activate. He and the first officer performed the memory and initial action items on the hard card checklists for an engine fire and shutdown the No. 2 engine. In addition, the captain discharged an engine fire bottle. The engine fire light continued to illuminate. The captain then fired a second engine fire bottle. The engine fire light continued to be illuminated. The captain requested that the relief pilot return to the cockpit. He then contacted  Air Traffic Control (ATC) and told them that their No. 2 engine was on fire and that they intended to land at the nearest suitable field. ATC responded that Charlotte was 35 miles away with a 10,000 foot runway. He asked for radar vectors and an immediate descent into Charlotte. They were given a lower altitude. The first officer initiated fuel dumping. The relief pilot returned to the cockpit and he asked the relief pilot and the first officer to run the checklists. As they descended the aircraft encountered heavy rain, light hail, and moderate turbulence. In addition, they observed a bright flash to the left of the nose, which might have been a lightning strike. As they completed the descent and approach checklists he told the crew to expect an emergency evacuation upon landing and directed the first officer to so inform the flight attendants. The aircraft was configured for an engine out approach and they reviewed the loss of a second engine procedure. The remainder of the approach, touchdown and landing roll occurred within normal parameters. He brought the airplane to a stop on the runway. The engine fire indication remained illuminated. The relief pilot stated they did not terminate fuel dumping prior to landing. They completed the items on the evacuation checklist. He then ordered an evacuation of the airplane. According to Delta Air Lines representatives, examination of the No. 2 engine by company maintenance personnel found one fire loop chafed through an adjacent cable, an integrated drive generator (IDG) feeder cable, inside the No. 2 engine cowling This allowed a direct 115 volt AC connection between the IDG and the fire detection control unit. The result was an electrical short and complete failure of the detection control unit that was indicated in the cockpit as a  fire warning. There was no evidence of fire in the No. 2 engine. Boeing Service  Bullettin MD11-71-086 was issued on May 21, 1996. The subject of the service bulletin was ""Power Plant - Electrical Harness - Replace/Modify Integrated Drive Generator (IDG) Wire Harness Support Brackets"". On May 21, 2001, Boeing elevated the service bulletin to the ""Alert"" level. Boeing recommended that aircraft operators accomplish the service bulletin within 1 year. According to Delta Air Lines personnel, in November 2001, Delta Air Lines Aircraft Engineering issued a Engineering Order to comply with Alert Service Bulletin MD11-71A086. The Engineering Order stated that all engines should be inspected and modified by November 2002. All three engines on the accident aircraft were inspected and modified in accordance with the Engineering Order on March 3, 2002. On March 28, 2002, the No. 2 engine was changed and the engine installed had not been modified by the Engineering Order.The Delta Airlines descent, approach, and before landing checklists dated June 30, 2000, and which were in use at the time of the accident, required the pilots to check the Engine and Alert Display. When fuel dumping is activated, a message is displayed on the Engine and Alert Display. Probable Cause: The failure of the aircraft operator to comply with, in a timely manner, on the No. 2 engine, Boeing Alert Service Bulletin MD11-71A086, resulting in the integrated drive generator feeder cable chaffing through a fire warning loop and failure of the fire warning system due to electrical damage. This resulted in a continuous indication in the cockpit of a No. 2 engine fire, an emergency descent and landing, and injuries to passengers during the subsequent emergency evacuation of the airplane.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: MIA02FA075 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources: NTSB MIA02FA075  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates25-Mar-2024 10:48 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

Air China flight 129 departed Beijing at 08:37 on a scheduled flight to Pusan-Gimhae in South Korea. The en route part of the flight was uneventful. At 11:06 the second officer contacted Gimhae Approach. At that moment the airplane was 32 nm from the airport at an altitude of FL170. The approach controller cleared the flight to descend to 6000 feet. Runway 36L was in use and the crew could expect a straight-in approach. at 11:09 the controller notified the crew that the runway was changed to 18R, with winds 210 degrees at 17 kts. This meant a circling approach which none of the crew members had flown yet at Pusan. The captain and first officer then discussed the approach to be flown. The captain cautioned: ""We won't enlarge the traffic pattern, the mountains are all over that side."" At 11:13 the flight was further cleared down to 2600 feet. Two minutes later the approach controller radioed: ""Air China 129, turn left heading 030 cleared for ILS DME runway 36L, then circle to runway 18 right, report field in sight."" At 11:17 they captured the ILS and were cleared further down to the circling altitude of 700 feet. The landing gear was extended and flaps set at 20 degrees. Then the controller instructed the flight to contact Gimhae Tower and to circle west. The second officer responded but did not read back the frequency change. The captain then instructed the first officer to disconnect the autopilot and turn left. From his position in the right hand seat the first officer was able to observe the runway. As the aircraft passed abeam the runway the autopilot was reengaged with heading select. At that moment the approach controller again contacted flight 129 instructing them to contact the tower. The crew were busy looking outside to see when they passed abeam the end of the runway. Simultaneously the Gimhae Tower controller contacted the flight using the emergency frequency. As they passed abeam the threshold at 11:20:02 they started timing to measure the commencement f turning to base. Eleven seconds after the call on the emergency frequency, the second officer reported to the Tower controller that they were on the circle approach. At 11:20:17 the captain took over control from the first officer and said he was going to turn base. He slowly began a widening turn, causing the first officer to urge him: ""turn quickly, not too late."" Meanwhile the flight was cleared to land . At 11:20:32 the captain disconnected the autopilot and banked the plane to the right. Twenty-two seconds later the first officer cautioned: ""Pay attention to the altitude keeping,"" and the captain asked him to help him get a visual on the runway. Due to the limited visibility they were not able to see the runway. The first officer then advised the captain to initiate a go around, but the captain did not respond. At 11:21:15 the first officer said, ""Pull up! Pull up!"" Pitch attitude was increased to 11.4 degrees but thrust was not increased. Two seconds later the aircraft impacted a mountain, about 4.6 km from the runway. FINDINGS RELATED TO PROBABLE CAUSES: 1. The flight crew of flight 129 performed the circling approach, not being aware of the weather minima of wide-body aircraft (B767-200) for landing, and in the approach briefing, did not include the missed approach, etc., among the items specified in Air ChinaÂs operations and training manuals. 2. The flight crew exercised poor crew resource management and lost situational awareness during the circling approach to runway 18R, which led them to fly outside of the circling approach area, delaying the base turn, contrary to the captainÂs intention to make a timely base turn. 3. The flight crew did not execute a missed approach when they lost sight of the runway during the circling approach to runway 18R, which led them to strike high terrain (mountain) near the airport. 4. When the first officer advised the captain to execute a missed approach about 5 seconds before impact, the captain did not react, nor did the first officer initiate the missed approach himself.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: KAIB Report number: KAIB/AAR F0201 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) Aviation Safety Network photo (c) Peter Frei; Berlin-SchÃ¶nefeld Airport (SXF); 09 July 1990 photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Beijing-Capital Airport (PEK); 18 October 1996 photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Beijing-Capital Airport (PEK); 30 March 1997 photo (c) Ralph Kunadt; Guangzhou-Baiyun Airport (CAN); 23 November 1991 photo (c) Alan Tsui; Hong Kong-Kai Tak International Airport (HKG); 21 November 1999 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates02-Jan-2025 10:51 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The captain briefed the lead flight attendant on the expected turbulence encounter and asked that the cabin be secured early with everyone, including the flight attendants, in their seats and secured.  A prearranged chime signal would notify the lead flight attendant that everyone should be in their seats.  After the chime signal, everyone was seated and secured; however, a flight attendant seated in the rear of the airplane noticed that a galley upper door compartment had come open.  This compartment was in line with both her head and another attendant's head, and she was concerned about objects coming out of the compartment during landing and injuring either one of them.  She unfastened her restraints, got up, and secured the door.  As she was returning to her seat, the airplane encountered a severe jolt, which violently slammed her into the ceiling, then the floor.

The crew was anticipating a visual approach to Runway 36 at Winnipeg International Airport but, because of conflicting traffic, accepted vectors for the instrument landing system (ILS) approach to Runway 13. At approximately 1908 central daylight time, the aircraft landed to the right of the runway centreline, then drifted further right and departed the runway surface, damaging a runway edge light, a taxiway edge light, and a runway identification sign. It then travelled 1150 feet through the infield and came to rest near the intersection of Runways 13/31 and 18/36. There were no reported injuries. The aircraft's left engine (Garrett TPE 33) sustained damage from ingested mud and vegetation. The right wing, left wing, and fuselage were damaged when the aircraft struck the edge lights and the runway identification sign. After the aircraft stopped, the crew shut down the engines and advised the Winnipeg Airport air traffic controller of their position.

The airplane was traveling in a predominately northern direction at 37,000 feet altitude during the encounter.   Weather products obtained showed that extreme intensity thunderstorms existed in the area where the turbulence was encountered.  Weather data and aircraft position radar data show that the airplane was 9 miles south-southwest of a cloud buildup that extended to 39,000 feet.  Additionally, the airplane was 5 miles west of an extreme intensity radar echo associated with the thunderstorms in the area.  The airline's General Operations Manual states that thunderstorms that are identified as severe, or giving a intense radar echo should be avoided by at least 20 miles.  No National Weather Service aviation weather advisories were in effect for the location and time of the turbulence encounter.  Communications transcripts show that the flight crew requested and were granted a course deviation for weather about 10 minutes prior to the upset. However, the Digital Flight Data Recorder shows that the seat belt sign was illuminated only 10 seconds prior to the encounter. Probable Cause: The flightcrew's failure to follow weather avoidance prcedures and their delay in activating the seat belt sign.   Factors were the turbulent thunderstorm weather conditions, and the failure of the National Weather Service to issue an applicable in-flight weather advisory.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CHI02LA111 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB CHI02LA111  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates25-Mar-2024 10:48 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

The flight was the third flight of eight flights planned for the day between Jayapura and Wamena. The en route part of the flight was uneventful and the pilot carried out an S-approach pattern for runway 15. Because the crew misjudged their distance to the runway they ended up being unable to decrease speed and extend flaps to landing configuration. With a high rate of descent the aircraft touched down. On touchdown the airplane bounced twice, the second and last bounce was reported to be more severe than the first one, causing the nose gear to collapse. The hydraulic system sustained damage, causing fluid to leak, which caught fire due to the friction of the aircraft on the runway. The captain applied reverse power and brakes, controlling the aircraft by using rudder inputs. The airplane decelerated with smoke emitting from the forward cargo compartment. After coming to a standstill, the loadmaster opened the airplane door taking the extinguisher, attempting to extinguish the fire. The airport fire truck could not be started, so the fire fighting personnel ran to the airplane carrying portable fire extinguishers. After twenty minutes the truck's battery had been recharged.
