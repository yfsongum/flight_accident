The pilot and five passengers were not injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.  The pilot reported the flight proceeded uneventfully until landing. The air traffic controller advised him that the Black Hills Airport-Clyde Ice Field (SPF) runway was covered with 1/8â of wet snow. However, the runway braking action was reported as 5/5/5 (touchdown/midpoint/rollout) meaning that braking action was good and all portions of the runway wet including the presence snow. The airport was in sight about 4 miles out, and the pilot executed a straight-in approach to runway 13. He verified that the landing gear was down. His intention was to touchdown at the landing reference speed (Vref) to minimize the need for braking. He disconnected the autopilot at 2 miles from the runway, and the airplane appeared to be lined up with the extended runway centerline.  The pilot recalled that during landing, about 8 to 10 feet above ground level (agl), he received an aerodynamic stall warning with the stick shaker. At first, the touchdown seemed normal, but then the airplane started drifting to the left. The pilot efforts to maintain directional control were not successful. The airplane âlurched hardâ when it impacted the snowbank along the left side of the runway. When the airplane came to rest, he shut down the engine, and the airplane was evacuated.  One of the passengers reported that he was seated behind the right-side (co-pilot) seat and had a âgood viewâ out of the windshield. He confirmed seeing the 3-green landing gear down lights while on approach. He noted that the airplane appeared to be aligned with but was slightly left of the runway centerline. As the airplane touched down, it quickly drifted to the left.  The left wing then caught the snowbank, and the airplane departed the left side of the runway. The airplane ultimately came to rest with the nose perpendicular to and facing the runway. The passenger recalled that when he exited the airplane, the wind was almost calm.  A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector responded to the accident site the following day. He reported that the airplane had been moved to the ramp area of the airport. The right wing had substantial sustained damage which included deformation and delamination of the wing structure, partial separation of the right aileron, and damage to the fuel tank. The left main landing gear was extended, the right main landing gear was retracted in the wheel well, and the nose landing gear was collapsed. When the right landing gear was extended after recovery, the tire was still on the wheel rim and appeared intact, but the tire was flat.  The FAA inspector observed runway wheel marks (compressed snow) that corresponded to the accident airplane. The airplane appeared to have touched down about 150 feet before the 1,000-foot / touchdown zone markers. At touchdown, the left main wheel was 6 to 8 feet from the left side of the runway. The airplane departed the left side of the runway about 140 feet after it touched down. The snowbanks on each side of the runway were 2 to 3-feet high. The airplane struck two runway edge lights during the excursion.  Further examination of the airplane and download of available onboard data is pending.

All 64 occupants of the CRJ-701 and the three soldiers in the Army helicopter died in the accident. The Black Hawk helicopter was from the Bravo Company, 12th Aviation Battalion, Davison Army Airfield, Fort Belvoir, Virginia. It was flying at low altitude over the Potomac River from north to south while on a combined annual and night vision goggle check ride for the pilot flying. The crew is believed to have been wearing their night vision goggles. Flight 5342 took off from Wichita Airport, Kansas (ICT) at 17:38 local time (23:38 UTC). Prior to descent, the flight crew briefed the expected arrival procedure (TRUPS FIVE) for an ILS approach to runway 01 at DCA. Descent began at 20:15 ET. At 20:30 local time (01:30 UTC), the Black Hawk helicopter, PAT25, begins traveling generally southbound after maneuvering near Laytonsville, MD. Cockpit voice recorder (CVR) data indicates the instructor pilot was pilot monitoring (PM), and the check ride pilot was pilot flying (PF). At 20:33:41, PAT25 requests the Tower for helicopter routes 1 to 4 to Davison Army Airfield (KDAA), which was approved. At 20:38:39, PAT25 reaches the intersection of the DC Beltway and the Potomac River near Carderock, MD, begins descending, and picks up route 1 over the river towards downtown Washington, DC. At 20:39:10, the Potomac Approach controller cleared the flight for the Mount Vernon visual approach to runway 01. Four minutes later the crew contacted DCA Tower. The controller asked if the crew could switch to an approach to runway 33. After a brief discussion between the crew, they agreed to runway 33. At 20:43:48, PAT25 was 1.1 nautical miles (nmi) west of the Key Bridge. At this point, the PF had an indicated altitude of 300 ft, while the PM had an indicated altitude of 400 ft. Neither pilot commented on the discrepancy. At 20:44:41, the CRJ begins selecting flaps 30, then flaps 40. Eight seconds later, their landing gear was down and locked, with the aircraft fully configured for landing at 6.2 nmi south of the airport. At 20:45:27, the CRJ's autopilot was disconnected, and it began a shallow right turn off the path of the localizer at a radio altitude of 1700 ft and airspeed of 134 kt. They were 5 nmi south of the airport. Three seconds later, PAT25 passed over the Memorial Bridge. The PM told the PF they were at 300 ft and needed to descend, with the PF responding they would descend to 200 ft. At 20:46:01, the Tower controller called PAT25, advising them that a CRJ was at 1200 feet just south of the Woodrow Wilson Bridge circling to runway 33. This communication was audible from the CRJ, but the portion stating the traffic was ""circling"" may not have been heard by PAT25. Seven seconds later, PAT25 responded they had the traffic in sight and requested visual separation, which was approved by the Tower. At 20:46:29, the crew of the CRJ700 received a 1,000 ft automated call out. At 20:47:27, PAT25 passed the southern tip of Hains Point, a second before the CJR began its left roll to final for runway 33 at 133 kt of airspeed. Another second later, the crew of the CRJ700 received a 500 ft automated call out. At 20:47:39, DCA Tower called PAT25 asking them if they had the CRJ in sight. This was audible in both CVRs. A conflict alert was audible in the background of the Tower's transmission. At 20:47:40, the crew of the CRJ700 received an automated Traffic Advisory call out ('Traffic, Traffic'). At 20:47:42, the Tower directed PAT 25 to pass behind the CRJ. This was audible in both CVRs, but PAT25's CVR data indicates the portion of the transmission stating ""pass behind the"" may not have been received by PAT25 due to the crew keying their mic for 0.8 seconds, stepping on the Tower's transmission. Two seconds later, PAT25's crew stated they had the traffic in sight, and requested visual separation, which was again approved. The PM told the PF they believed ATC wanted them to move left, towards the east bank of the Potomac river. At 20:47:58, the CRJ700 started increasing its pitch after a verbal reaction from the crew, with almost full deflection of the elevators. A second later, a collision occurred. While the Tower communicated simultaneously in two VHF frequencies, PAT25 and the CRJ700 were communicating separately in one of each of those frequencies. This meant they could both hear the Tower, and vice-versa, but could not hear each other's transmissions. The last radio altitude recorded by the CRJ700, two seconds before impact, was 313 ft, and their descent rate was 448 ft/min. Their pitch reached 9Â° nose up after the crew's reaction, as well as 11Â° left wing down of roll. PAT25's last recorded radio altitude was 278 ft, steady for the previous 5 seconds. Their pitch at collision time was about 0.5Â° nose up, with 1.6Â° of left roll. NTSB: National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy told reporters that the recording from the UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter cockpit suggested an incomplete radio transmission may have left the crew without understanding how it should shift position seconds before the crash. âThat transmission was interrupted, it was stepped on,â she said, leaving them unable to hear the words âpass behind theâ because the helicopterâs microphone key was pressed at the same moment. Cockpit conversations a few minutes before the crash indicated conflicting altitude data, with the helicopterâs pilot calling out that they were then at 300 feet (91 meters), but the instructor pilot saying they were at 400 feet (122 meters), Homendy said.METAR: KDCA 300152Z 30014G23KT 270V330 10SM CLR 10/M07 A2990 RMK AO2 PK WND 30033/0108 SLP126 T01001072 KDCA 300052Z 29015G25KT 10SM CLR 11/M07 A2987 RMK AO2 SLP114 T01061072 Sources: https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/live-blog/live-updates-plane-crashes-potomac-river-collision-helicopter-reagan-n-rcna189942  https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/plane-crash-dca-potomac-washington-dc-01-29-25/index.html  https://www.arlnow.com/2025/01/29/breaking-aircraft-crash-reported-near-national-airport/  https://registry.faa.gov/AircraftInquiry/Search/NNumberResult?nNumberTxt=709PS  https://www.flightaware.com/live/flight/N709PS/history/20250129/2328Z/KICT/KDCA  https://airlive.net/military/2025/02/16/an-incomplete-radio-transmission-may-have-left-the-black-hawk-pilots-with-no-idea-they-were-supposed-to-pass-behind-the-plane/  https://cdn.jetphotos.com/full/5/61280_1622165838.jpg (photo)  NTSB :  https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/Pages/DCA25MA108.aspx  https://www.flickr.com/photos/ntsb/albums/72177720323544846/ History of this aircraft Ex N165MD, (N709PS), C-FCHO,C-GIAD Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  15 February 2017 N709PS PSA Airlines, opf American Eagle 0 Charlotte-Douglas International Airport, NC (CLT/KCLT) sub 27 June 2018 N709PS PSA Airlines, opf American Eagle 0 Harrisburg International Airport, PA (MDT/KMDT) min 26 March 2021 N709PS PSA Airlines, opf American Eagle 0 North Canton, Ohio min Windscreen cracks or failure Location  Images: N709PS at Charlotte Douglas International in April 2022 (photo: Colin Brown) Photo: U.S. Coast Guard Media:An incomplete radio transmission may have left the Black Hawk pilots with no idea they were supposed to pass behind the plane https://t.co/ZenbDJcl8t— AIRLIVE (@airlivenet) February 16, 2025 Few more clearer visuals show the moment of collision between the American Airlines CRJ700 aircraft (N709PS) and Blackhawk UH-60 Helicopter (PAT25) over Potomac River the the Washington DC.#accident #aviation #airlines #aircraft https://t.co/xNRcbJEXbU pic.twitter.com/4ky64G9jnDâ FL360aero (@fl360aero) January 31, 2025 ð¨#BREAKING: Shared to me anonymously shows the Playback from official Air Traffic Control radar ð#Washington | #DCWatch as exclusive playback, sent anonymously by @avgeekjake to Rawsalerst, reveals official Air Traffic Control radar footage displaying the Collision Alert.â¦ pic.twitter.com/s2SvT2OTPJâ R A W S A L E R T S (@rawsalerts) January 30, 2025 Photos appear to show a plane wing and part of the fuselage in the Potomac River.Credit: Andrew Harnik/Getty Images pic.twitter.com/fKn8znVmQYâ MSNBC (@MSNBC) January 30, 2025 Audio between PAT25 and DCA tower asking if they have the CRJ in sight.

Ontario. The four crew members and seventy-six passengers survived, but eighteen people were injured, three of them seriously. Several videos captured the accident sequence. On touchdown, the right hand main gear collapsed, causing a fire and the right wing to contact the ground. The wing dragged along the runway surface for about 3 seconds before the aircraft flipped inverted. A post crash fire ensued which was (mostly) contained by airport emergency services. Photos from the scene shows that the right wing had separated and the aircraft came to rest inverted. The main gear and tail control surfaces were impact damaged and separated as well.
