Airworthiness Directive AD 48-12-01 mandates the replacement of the potentially hazardous fuel line, but the line had not been replaced on this aircraft. 2. A fuel leak from the main fuel inlet line in the engine compartment of this cargo DC-4 caused an in-flight fire that spread into the nacelle and wing. 3.

The car collided with the right wing of the aircraft, which was stopped at the H1 holding point of runway 30. In the preceding minutes, an Alitalia aircraft, with call sign AZ085, had taken off for Milan. After takeoff, IB1343 was cleared to enter runway 30 and ANS8831 was cleared to taxi to the H1 holding point vacated by IB1343.  The Alitalia aircraft radioed, two minutes before the accident, to report a possible loss of an object during takeoff, advising a runway check. The controller called the signalman for an check of runway 12/30. The signalman moved with the car from the base house, along taxiway A to H1 to access the runway from there, and the accident occurred at this waiting point.  Causes It is considered that the collision of the signaling service vehicle with the EC-JEN aircraft, which was stopped at the H1 holding point, occurred because the signaller was not aware of the presence of the aircraft. The signaling car had been authorized by the Valencia Airport aerodrome control service to access the H1 holding point without having been informed of the presence of the EC-JEN aircraft, which in turn had been authorized to taxi to the same point minutes earlier. Possible influencing factors in the accident are considered to be: - Glare effect exerted by the road running to the left and converging with taxiway A when, in night light conditions, taxiing from the north apron to standby point H1. - Aircraft logo lights off, limiting visibility to the rear, especially in areas close to the runway. - Incorrect execution of runway inspection procedures. - Excessive speed of the signaling vehicle in the movement area. - Movement of the signaling vehicle along the edge of the taxiway. - Decreased visibility of the accident area from the control tower due to light conditions and the presence of trees. - Decreased attention in both controller and signalman due to: * A low workload environment, with perceived absence of threats and no demanding demands due to the high degree of experience on the job, and. * Work shifts that disrupt daytime cycles of activity.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIAIAC Report number: A-002/2006 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: CIAIAC Ref.

Airline station personnel had received authorization to call contract maintenance to investigate the oil leak from one of the airline's senior maintenance controllers.  As a result, three mechanics from a fixed base operator (FBO) at the airport were called by the airline station personnel.  The FBO had previously entered into an agreement with the airline to provide contract maintenance at the airport.   All of the airline's maintenance manuals were maintained at the airline's headquarters maintenance control base.  According to the airline's procedures, extracts of those manuals with specific procedures were required to be transmitted prior to the contractor performing maintenance, and only after authorization by the airline's maintenance control.   After becoming concerned about the delay in hearing back regarding the investigation into the engine leak, a senior maintenance controller for the airline attempted to contact airline station personnel, and the FBO, several times to determine what instructions and authorizations would be needed.  The investigation revealed that the FBO did not make contact with the airline to obtain the requested maintenance approval and required documentation to work on the engine.     Meanwhile, both sides of the engine fan cowl panels were opened by the mechanics to conduct the engine inspection and check for leaks.  The mechanics made a request to the captain (via ground-to-cockpit intercom system) for an engine run to check for the leak source.  One mechanic positioned himself on the inboard side of the right engine and the other mechanic on the outboard side of the engine.  The third mechanic was positioned clear of the engine because he was assigned to observe the procedure as part of his on-the-job training.   The engine was started and stabilized at idle RPM for approximately 3 minutes while the initial leak check was performed by the two journeymen mechanics that were working around the engine.  One of these two mechanics then called the captain on the ground intercom system and reported that a small oil leak was detected, and he requested that the captain run the engine at 70 percent power for 2 minutes to conduct further checks.  The captain complied with the request, after verifying with the mechanic that the area around the airplane was clear.   Witnesses on the ground and in the airplane stated that they saw the mechanic on the outboard side of the engine stand up, step into the inlet hazard zone, and become ingested into the intake of the engine.  This occurred about 90 seconds into the 70-percent-power engine run.  The mechanic was not wearing any type of safety equipment or lanyard to prevent the ingestion.  Upon sensing a buffet, the captain immediately retarded the power lever back to the idle position.  The first officer stated to the captain that something went into the engine and the captain immediately cut off the start lever to stop the engine run.   The mechanic who was fatally injured was hired by the FBO in November 1997, and had been a certified mechanic for 40 years.   He received maintenance training from the airline regarding on-call maintenance procedures in March 2004, nearly two years prior to the accident.  The airline provided training to contract maintenance stations in the form of classroom instruction, interactive computer based scenarios, and training videos.  Specific training (either initial or recurrent) regarding ground engine runs and associated hazards was not provided to the contract mechanics by the airline. According to the surviving contract mechanic that worked around the engine with the fatally injured mechanic, maintenance instructions were not needed for the engine run because engine oil leaks were a common occurrence, and because of his past experience as a mechanic. Under the section entitled ""Engine Run Rules - General"" i Probable Cause: the mechanic's failure to maintain proper clearance with the engine intake during a jet engine run, and the failure of contract maintenance personnel to follow written procedures and directives contained in the airline's general maintenance manual.  Factors contributing to the accident were the insufficient training provided to the contract mechanics by the airline, and the failure of the airport to disseminate a policy prohibiting ground engine runs above idle power in the terminal area.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DFW06FA056 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: NTSB: https://www.ntsb.gov/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/brief.aspx?ev_id=20060131X00140&key=1  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates30-Apr-2014 07:03 Katonk2014 Added 03-May-2014 10:29 Katonk2014 Updated [Total fatalities, ]21-Dec-2016 19:28 ASN Update Bot Updated [Time, Damage, Category, Investigating agency, ]05-Dec-2017 09:00 ASN Update Bot Updated [Cn, Operator, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, ]28-Aug-2024 16:11 Anon.

On board the aircraft were two Mozambican pilots, accompanied by two paramedics, an elderly male patient with a fractured hip secured to a stretcher and the patient's wife. The pilot-in-command who was also the pilot flying stated that after an uneventful flight, he executed a normal landing on Runway 06L at Lanseria International Aerodrome. He then selected reverse thrust on both engines but during the landing roll, the pilot not flying notified him that the left-hand main landing gear, down and locked light went out and the red landing gear unsafe warning light had illuminated. Shortly thereafter the left-hand wing started to drop and whilst the pilot attempted to maintain directional control, he requested the non flying pilot to shut down the engines. The aircraft veered off the runway onto the grass area next to the runway before coming to rest on the grass area. The pilots, passenger, paramedics and patient sustained no injuries during the accident however the aircraft sustained damage to the left-hand main landing gear, left-hand engine, left-hand propeller, left-hand landing gear doors and left-hand outboard and inboard flaps. The last Phase Inspection prior to the accident was certified on 27 March 2005 at 21152 airframe hours. At the time of the accident the aircraft had accumulated a further 186 airframe hours since the last phase inspection was certified. Probable Cause The left-hand undercarriage support arm draglink upper attachment bolt failed during the landing and the pilot was unable to maintain directional control of the aircraft. The aircraft veered off the runway to the left.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CAA S.A.

The aircraft did not make it and crashed in the woods, some 10 km from the airport. CONCLUSIONS FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1. The engine lost power when a compressor turbine blade failed as a result of the overstress extension of a fatigue-generated crack. The fracture initiated at a metallurgical anomaly in the parent blade material and progressed, eventually resulting in blade failure due to overstress rupture. 2. The combination of aircraft position at the time of the engine failure, the lack of equipment enabling the pilot to locate and identify high terrain, and the resultant manoeuvring required to avoid entering instrument flight conditions likely prevented the pilot from attempting to glide to the nearest airfield. FINDINGS AS TO RISK: 1. Single-engine instrument flight rules (SEIFR) operations in designated mountainous regions have unique obstacle risks in the event of an engine failure. Canadian equipment requirements for such operations do not currently include independent terrain mapping, such as terrain awareness and warning systems (TAWS). 2. Airline operators are not currently required to conduct any additional route evaluation or structuring to ensure that the risk of an off-field landing is minimized during SEIFR operations. 3. Pilots involved in commercial SEIFR operations do not receive training in how to conduct a forced landing under instrument flight conditions; such training would likely improve a pilot's ability to respond to an engine failure when operating in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC). 4. Mean time between failure (MTBF) calculations do not take into account In Flight Shut Downs (IFSDs) not directly attributable to the engine itself; it may be more appropriate to monitor all IFSD events. 5. The design of the Cessna 208B Caravan fuel shutoff valves increases the risk that the valves will open on impact, allowing fuel spillage and increasing the potential for fire.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: TSB Report A06P001 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: CADORS Number: 2006P0080   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane climbed to its assigned cruising altitude of FL380, which was reached at about 06:06 MST. The descend for Carlsbad was started an hour later, at 06:06 PST. Air traffic control cleared the flightcrew for the ILS approach to runway 24, which was 4,897 feet long. The flightcrew then reported that they had the runway in sight, cancelled their IFR clearance, and executed a VFR approach in VFR conditions to the airport. The reported winds favoured a landing toward the east, onto the opposite runway (runway 6). During the approach, after a query from the first officer, the captain indicated to the first officer that he was going to ""...land to the east,"" consistent with the reported winds. However, the final approach and subsequent landing were made to runway 24, which produced a six-knot tailwind. During the approach sequence the captain maintained an airspeed that was approximately 30 knots higher than the correct airspeed for the aircraft's weight, resulting in the aircraft touching down about 1,500 feet further down the runway than normal, and much faster than normal. The captain then delayed the initiation of a go-around until the first officer asked if they were going around. Although the aircraft lifted off the runway surface prior to departing the paved overrun during the delayed go-around it impacted a localizer antenna platform, whose highest non-frangible structure was located approximately 304 feet past the end of the runway, and approximately two feet lower than the terrain at the departure end of the runway. The aircraft continued airborne as it flew over downsloping terrain for about 400 more feet before colliding with the terrain and a commercial storage building that was located at an elevation approximately 80 feet lower than the terrain at the end of the runway. The localizer antenna platform was located outside of the designated runway safety area, and met all applicable FAA siting requirements. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The captain's delayed decision to execute a balked landing (go-around) during the landing roll. Factors contributing to the accident include the captain's improper decision to land with a tailwind, his excessive airspeed on final approach, and his failure to attain a proper touchdown point during landing.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: SEA06MA047 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; GenÃ¨ve-Cointrin Airport (GVA/LSGG); June 1999 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The crew stated that, after talking with maintenance personnel on the ground at Asheville, they decided to divert to Greensboro/High Point-Piedmont Triad International Airport, NC (GSO), where there were better facilities to handle the situation. One of the passengers had noticed that after the crew had recycled the gear the last time, a panel on the right wing was pushed up. The flight continued to Greensboro, at 150 knots with the gear down. Greensboro tower personnel cleared the flight for a visual approach. According to the crew, the landing was normal for the first 2,000 feet of roll out, then the right main landing gear collapsed. The crew said that, when the gear collapsed, they shut down both engines and the airplane veered off the right side of the runway into the grass. Both crewmembers and passengers exited the airplane through the main door with no injuries.

Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed and a visual flight rules flight plan was filed. The airline transport-rated pilot, and five passengers received fatal injuries and the airplane was destroyed.  The multi-engine airplane rolled inverted and dove into the ground on a landing approach. According to witnesses, the airplane made two approaches to runway 23. During the first approach the airplane was observed, ""fish tailing"" while about 30 feet over the runway. The airplane appeared to regain control and continued flying over the runway until passing the air traffic control tower, at which time the airplane began a climbing left turn. The witnesses stated that they heard the pilot tell the air traffic controller that he was doing a go-around. The controller asked the pilot if he had problems with the sea fog. The pilot responded back to the controller ""no that his left engine kept power up a little too much and would not come back."" The witnesses observed the airplane circle the airport to the left, and watched it line up on runway 23 for the second time.

They found that both brake assemblies each had one return mechanism binding.  The return mechanism had a self adjusting friction bushing meant to slip along the return pin at a predetermined spring pressure.  As pressure was applied to the brake, the pressure plate extended toward the number one rotor, pulling the return pins through the swage and tube assemblies and compressing the return springs.  Although the swage should move through the tube, one swage on each brake was not moving freely.  The brake travel went further than normal because ""normal travel"" was never set. Probable Cause: mechanical binding of the normal brake system, rendering directional control impossible.  Contributing factors were the improper overhaul, inadequate quality control procedures by the overhaul facility, and the rough terrain.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: MIA06LA052 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: NTSB MIA06LA052 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates09-Oct-2022 07:08 ASN Update Bot Added 17-Nov-2022 00:01 Ron Averes Updated [Aircraft type, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The aircraft landed on runway 26 (4134 feet / 1265 m long) but overran the runway end and fell down an embankment. Conclusions (translated from German report): The accident is attributable to the following: Immediate causes: - Unintentional ignition of a pyrotechnic distress signal in the passenger cabin - Emergency caused by fire and smoke - Misunderstandings in communication - Failure to use reverse thrust or braking parachute and insufficient use of the wheel brakes Systemic causes: - Improper storage of pyrotechnic signaling means on board - Inadequate training of the crew by the air carriers regarding the emergency equipment.Sources: DPA  Izvestiya   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

He applied brakes again and the airplane again ""swerved"" to the right.  He again corrected back to the runway centerline and applied the brakes a third time.  The airplane again ""swerved"" to the right.  He then applied the emergency brake.  The airplane departed the right side of the runway and struck the concrete pad of a runway marker sign. An FAA inspector reported finding hydraulic fluid covering the left main landing gear.  He said the main and auxiliary left brake lines were both fractured, and the right main landing gear tire was ""shredded off the wheel.""  According to NTSB's Materials Laboratory Factual Report, the brake line transmits hydraulic fluid and the auxiliary brake line transmits compressed nitrogen.  Both brake line fractures were the result of fatigue cracking.  No mechanical or other damage was evident on the exterior of the line in the initiation area. Maintenance records dating back to the airplane's date of manufacture revealed the brake lines had never been removed or replaced. Probable Cause: Failure of both the left main and auxiliary brake lines due to fatigue cracking, rendering directional control impossible.  A contributing factor in this accident was the airport sign concrete pad.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: MIA06LA057 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB MIA06LA057 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates09-Oct-2022 07:01 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

The member of ground staff whose responsibility it was to ensure that the stand was unobstructed, was unable to see the whole stand from his assigned position in the jetty. Members of ground staff who saw the potential conflict were unable to alert the pilots. Three safety recommendations were made. Conclusion The right wingtip of the aircraft struck a van which was parked in an area of the stand which should have been free from all obstructions. The driver of the van was aware that he should not park there and had intended to move to a different position prior to the arrival of the aircraft. Congestion in the baggage handling area of the stand prevented him from doing so. The pilots were aware that the van was parked incorrectly but elected to continue onto the stand, believing that it would not be an obstacle. This would have been the case if the aircraft had been lined up on the stand centreline before entering the stand. However, the commander, aware of the confined nature of the stand, made a tighter turn onto the stand than that indicated by the lead-in line painted on the ground and remained at all times to the right of the stand centreline.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: EW/C2006/02/02 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5422f94340f0b613420006a9/Boeing_737-45D__SP-LLB_01-07.pdf  https://www.jetphotos.com/photo/435550 (Photo) History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  26 May 2011 SP-LLB LOT Polskie Linie Lotnicze 0 Brussel-Zaventem Airport (BRU/EBBR) sub Gear collapse 29 December 2019 N803TJ Swift Air 0 NW of San Jose , CA min Engine failure Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates03-Feb-2025 07:10 Justanormalperson Added 03-Feb-2025 07:13 ASN Updated [Narrative, Accident report, ] Corrections or additions? ...

When the pilots, after several tries, did not manage to get normal function of the landing gear they requested to go back and land at the departure airport. During the return flight the pilots requested to make a low fly-by over the airport to try to get the position of the landing gear checked from the ground by airport personnel. This was accepted and the aircraft made an ILS approach 1 to runway 03 and levelled out at 200â300 above ground level. The low pass was made parallel to runway 03 and approximately halfway between the runway and the control tower. After the fly-by, during which the pilots heard that staff on the ground thought that all the landing gear was lowered, they decided to land on runway 03. A smooth landing was achieved on the main gear at about 100 knots IAS and with the nose wheel in the air. The nose wheel remained extended for about 2.5 seconds after its first contact with the ground, and then the nose wheel gear folded forwards towards its retracted state. The nose of the aircraft hit the runway and the aircraft slid further, supported by its nose and the main landing gear for about 300 meters before it stopped. No one onboard was injured and the evacuation was made via slides.  During the evacuation one of the cabin crew, a female, had difficulties to lock the rear left door in full open position which made the evacuation difficult. The technical investigation has showed that a grease-nipple on the nose wheel locking mechanism was blocked resulting in insufficient lubrication causing the mechanism to jam. Furthermore the Board has noted that the certification requirements for emergency evacuation from an inclined aircraft do not contain a requirement for the door to be capable of being secured in the open position. The accident was caused by seizure of the nose wheel locking mechanism as a result of a blocked grease nipple, which prevented correct lubrication.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: SHK Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SHK Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates14-Dec-2024 15:34 ASN Added Corrections or additions? ...

The operator reported that after the airplane's engines had been started, it was discovered that a baby stroller had not been off-loaded.  The station agents notified the captain, who shut down the left engine.  An agent accessed the cargo compartment, located at the left, rear portion of the airplane.  While he was exiting the compartment, the station agent lost his balance and dropped the stroller onto the ramp.  The stroller landed on its wheels and was blown under the fuselage by the wind and into the right main landing gear.  The stroller was subsequently blown forward into the right propeller arc, where the operating propeller struck it.  Fragments from the stroller impacted the airplane's fuselage, puncturing three holes and causing several dents in the pressurized fuselage.  The wind speed was about 20 knots, gusting to 31 knots, at the time of the accident. Probable Cause: The station agent's inability to maintain control of the stroller when he lost his balance exiting the airplane's cargo compartment, allowing it to be blown into the operating right propeller.

One flight attendant located in the aft galley sustained serious injuries.  The passengers and remaining crew were not injured.  The aircraft was not damaged.  The captain reported that the airplane was established in cruise at FL390 with smooth air conditions.  She stated that the turbulence encounter began with a ""slight buffet"" and ""rapidly increasing"" airspeed.  She attempted to maintain cruise airspeed by decreasing engine power and climbing to a higher altitude.  She noted that as she initiated the climb, the aircraft experienced moderate turbulence.  She reported that as the airplane reached FL400, the airspeed began a ""rapid decrease"" and she initiated a descent back to FL390.  The flight subsequently descended to FL350 before the conditions smoothed out.  She noted that the turbulence was encountered ""suddenly and without warning.""  The flight data recorder indicated that the airspeed increased from 236 knots to 273 knots during the encounter.  A vertical acceleration spike of 1.81 g's, followed by 0.61 g's, was recorded 64 seconds after the initial increase in airspeed. The weather forecast provided to the crew listed a risk of moderate turbulence between 20,000  and 38,000 feet. While ATC communications were describing light turbulence and moderate chop at lower altitudes, no reports from ATC, company dispatch, or other aircraft were received regarding mountain wave activity or turbulence at 39,000 feet. Probable Cause: An inadvertent encounter with unforecast mountain wave turbulence during cruise flight.  A contributing factor was the mountain wave (terrain induced) turbulence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CHI06LA099 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB CHI06LA099  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates25-Mar-2024 09:10 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

The aircraft was cleared for the VOR B approach to Butte at 14:48. A weather front had been approaching the area from the south to the north/northeast. Weather conditions included icing conditions followed by heavy snow fall with poor visibility and variable winds in the mountains.  According to the approach plate, the transition to the approach is via a DME arc at 9,000 feet with no procedure turn. The flight is to track inbound on the 127 degree radial, descending down to, but no lower than, 7,700 feet to the initial approach fix (IAF). After crossing the IAF, the flight is to turn to 097 degrees for 10 nautical miles and descend to 6,900 feet. The remainder of the 1.5 nautical miles to the runway is to be flown under visual conditions.  During the descent the airplane collided with trees and subsequently the mountainous terrain on a heading of approximately 127 degrees and about 6,900 feet mean sea level. The initial impact point was located approximately nine nautical miles on a magnetic bearing of 130 degrees from the IAF. Documentation of the horizontal situation indicator (HSI) on the left side instrument panel indicated that the course arrow was positioned to approximately 127 degrees, the inbound heading to the IAF. The co-pilot (right side) course arrow was positioned to 115 degrees. The location of the wreckage and the 127 degree heading on the HSI indicate that the pilots failed to follow the approach procedure and turn to a heading of 097 degrees after crossing the IAF. Search crews found the wreckage of the plane on March 20. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The second pilot's failure to follow the published instrument approach procedure and the captain/PIC's inadequate supervision.

The weather in Seville at the time of arrival was forecast to be stormy with variable rain and winds. The visibility, reduced by the heavy rain, was in excess of 2,000 m (RVR) at the runway 27 threshold. The runway in use at Seville was runway 27, which had CAT I visual and precision radio navigation landing aids. While in autopilot, the aircraft captured the ILS localizer as it neared Seville, at a distance of 11 NM from the runway 27 threshold. Flight 2652 was cleared to land on runway 27 some nine minutes prior to its arrival time and before descending below the transition level, which was at 7,500 ft above sea level. The control tower reported the wind about three minutes prior to landing, which at that time was from 240Â° at 15 kt. The runway was wet and it was raining heavily. The crew was told to proceed on course to Seville at their discretion and in accordance with their procedures. With the tower's clearance, they captured the glideslope early, far above the 2,000 ft specified in the published AIP procedure and descended along the ILS glideslope without significant deviations from the localize and glidepath until they were below 1,000 ft AGL and with the runway in sight. Established on the glideslope with the gear down and flaps 30Â°, they disengaged the autopilot at about 700 ft and shortly thereafter they started to climb above the glideslope. The aircraft then descended to the runway at very high descent rates. The EGPWS SINK RATE and PULL-UP warnings sounded shortly before touchdown. The airplane landed in the middle of an intense rain storm. Personnel in the control tower saw a flame or glow on the right side of the aircraft. During the hard impact with the runway at the aiming point, some 300 m beyond the threshold, the right main gear leg collapsed, pivoting backwards and partially detaching. The crew was able to maintain steering control of the aircraft, which came to a stop after a 900-m landing run. Full reverse thrusters were used to decelerate the airplane. The entire landing roll took place on the paved runway surface. Only at the end of the run did part of the airplane, the right wingtip, touch the ground in an area beyond the paved asphalt. After coming to a stop, and lacking the support from the right leg, the aircraft was being held up by its left leg and right engine, which is forward of the airplane's center of gravity, as a result of which the aircraft tilted backwards until the tail touched the ground during the final seconds of braking. There was no fuel leak and no fire. The captain gave the evacuation order, which was carried out using the four doors on both sides of the airplane. Due to the final nose-up pitch of the aircraft, the front doors were at a significant height above the ground. As a result, the emergency evacuation ramps were inclined at an excessive angle that hindered the exit of the airplane's occupants. Causes: ""The accident was caused by a very hard landing of the aircraft, during which the right main landing gear was broken, as a consequence of a non stabilized approach. The aircraft became unstabilized during the approach, which was conducted under stormy weather conditions with heavy rains and lightning, and the crew did not adhere to the applicable standard procedures.""METAR: 09:00 UTC / 10:00 local time: LEZL 180900Z 17011G22KT 3000 TSRA FEW015CB BKN020 15/15 Q1001 NOSIG=09:30 UTC / 10:30 local time: LEZL 180930Z 24011G22KT 3000 +TSRA SCT008 FEW015CB BKN020 14/14 Q1001 NOSIG=10:00 UTC / 11:00 local time: LEZL 181000Z 17005G16KT 140V240 3000 TSRA SCT008 FEW015CB BKN020 13/13 Q1001 NOSIG=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIAIAC Report number: A-011/2006 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 years and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: CIAIAC   Location  Images: photo (c) Jose MuÃ±oz; Sevilla Airport (SVQ); 19 March 2006 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

During the approach to runway 32R at Domodedovo Airport the airspeed was higher than recommended. The aircraft crossed the threshold at an altitude of 12 m and a speed of 304 km/h. During the flare, at an altitude of about 5 meters, the captain instructed the flight engineer to bring back the thrust levers to idle. The flight engineer confirmed selected all four engines to idle. The captain subsequently called for the thrust reversers to be deployed but the flight engineer did not confirm this instruction but asked again: ""Turn on the reverse?"".  The reverser buckets were then deployed, but the engines were not brought to the maximum reverse thrust. It is possible that at this moment the flight engineer was distracted. The aircraft floated at an altitude of 1-0.5 m over the runway. As a result, the landing of the aircraft occurred at a distance of 1100 m from the threshold end of the runway at a speed of 258 km/h. Before landing, the captain again instructed to turn on the reverse of the engines. A misunderstanding between the captain and flight engineer and subsequent actions by the flight engineer caused the two engines to be operated at full power with reversers stowed. The aircraft overran the end of the runway of runway 32R and continued for 680 meters before it collided with a slope of the ravine. The accident occurred as a result of erroneous actions by the flight engineer during operations to turn on the engine reverse when landing the plane, expressed in shifting the reverse buckets to direct thrust and putting the 1st and 4th engines to take-off mode after landing. The Commission concluded that the flight engineerÂs erroneous actions were facilitated by: - a low level of technological discipline in the crew due to the weak role of the captain as a leader in the crew, which was manifested in the crew members not fully fulfilling the ""Instructions for the interaction and technology of the crew members of the IL-62M aircraft"" and Aircraft Flight Manual during descent, approach and landing; - emotional relaxation of the crew at the end of a business trip and return to base; - lack of effective control, including according to the data of flight recorders over flight operations with LIBAVIA; - in the ""Instructions for the interaction and technology of the crew of the IL-62M aircraft"" there are no control functions on the part of other crew members for the actions of the flight engineer at the stage of aircraft landing and the status of the reverse  on/off alarm; - the absence in the training programs of the simulator of exercises for practicing the actions of crew members in case of erroneous actions by the flight engineer when the reverse is turned on; - lack of equipment for the flight engineerÂs workplace with a radio headset, lack of procedures in the ""Instructions for Interaction and the Work Technology of the Crew Members of the Il-62M Aircraft"" for the use of a radio headset for flight personnel in flights with a reduced crew; - excessive volume of the SSU speakers broadcasting external radio communications, which created additional difficulties when listening to the commands given by the captain; - fuzziness (illegibility) of the commands given by the PIC and the lack of response of the PIC to the non-confirmation of the commands given by him to the flight engineer.METAR: 16:30 UTC / 20:30 local time: UUDD 291630Z 17002MPS 2400 -RA BR BKN004 OVC100 03/02 Q1002 TEMPO 0500 FG =17:00 UTC / 21:00 local time: UUDD 291700Z 19002MPS 160V230 1800 -RA BR BKN004 OVC10003/02 Q1002 EMPO 0500 FG = Sources: MAK Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC)  Russian Ministry of Transport   Location  Images: photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; ?; January 2001 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane was expected to arrive at 18:02. After takeoff the crew requested cancellation of their IFR flight plan ant to continue under visual flight rules at FL45. This was approved. Upon request, the flight was cleared to descend to 2000 feet to avoid an area of poor weather. About 17:39 a left turn was initiated towards the coast line for the same reason. The airplane struck trees near the top of Pico da Pedra Bonita at an elevation of 1920 feet. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS (translated from Portuguese) 1. Human factors Psychological - Contributed It was found that the decision of the crew to cancel the IFR plan to continue VFR at low altitude and when visibility is not favorable, has been inadequate, with compliance of the pilots with such a decision. It is possible that the knowledge of the region obtained by the instructor captain caused over-confidence, influencing the decision. The organizational culture of the company proved to be complacent by not inhibiting the adoption of procedures incompatible with flight safety, such as the low altitude flights made by the instructor captain. Operational Aspect a. Judgement - Contributed There was inadequate assessment of the situation by the crew, causing them to fly at a lower altitude than the safe limits under visual conditions unsuitable for visual flight, resulting in the collision of the aircraft with high ground. b. Coordination Cabin - Contributed The use of human resources for the operation of the aircraft was unsuitable because of failure to comply with operational standards, leading the crew to perform a passenger flight to the lower altitude limits of safety, under inadequate visual conditions. c. Planning - Contributed The preparation for the flight proved inadequate because the crew did not have a meteorological analysis of the appropriate level of flight performed, considering that the conditions for the region were overshadowing the Serra do Mar and surrounding areas of low clouds and / or mist, especially on the slopes of the mountain. d. Adverse weather conditions - Contributors The weather conditions prevailing in the region made visual flight impossible, resulting in the concealment of the elevation at which the aircraft crashed. e. Flight indiscipline - Contributed The pilots intentionally not complying with rules of air traffic and civil aviation rules, without grounds, performing flight at low altitude, under conditions of visibility below the limits established for VFR flight, colliding with high ground. f Supervision - Contributed The company has not taken appropriate supervisory measures, enabling the existence of a culture of undeveloped flight safety, which prevented advance identification of actions taken by the crew and injured misconception exists in the CRM business, which represented a potential risk to their operations, as well as by the failure of some educational measures provided for in its PPAA (Plan for the Prevention of Aeronautical Accidents). 2 Material Factor Not contributed.

About ten minutes after takeoff the aircrew observed a No. 2 engine ""Thrust Reverser Not Locked"" indication light. They shut down the No. 2 engine as a precaution and decided to return to Dover. During the return the pilots and flight engineers continued to use the shut-down No. 2 engineÂs throttle while leaving the fully-operational No. 3 engine in idle. Also, the wrong flap setting was used. On final approach to runway 32, the airplane descended below the normal glidepath. The C-5 stalled , hit a utility pole and crashed into a field. The tail separated and the C-5 crash-landed further on. The nose section separated due to the impact. The airplane's flight deck was salvaged and flown to Macon-Robins AFB, GA (WRB) in August 2006 to be used as a modernized C-5 software simulator. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""Based on clear and convincing evidence, the Board President determined the primary cause of the mishap was the pilots' and flight engineers' failure to use the number three, fully operational, engine; the instructor's and primary flight engineer's failure to brief, and the pilots' failure to consider or utilize a 62.5 or 40% flap setting (instead of a 100% flap setting); and the pilots' attempt at a visual approach to runway 32, descending well below a normal glidepath for an instrument-aided approach or the normal VFR pattern altitude of 1,800 ft. There is substantial evidence that a contributing factor to this mishap was MP1's failure to give a complete approach briefing, in that, nonstandard factors, configuration, landing distance, and missed approach intentions were not addressed.""Sources: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AIRCRAFT ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION C-5B, S/N 84-0059 512th Airlift Wing, Dover Air Force Base, Delaware 3 April 2006 / USAF   Location  Images: photo (c) United States Air Force / Doug Curran; Dover AFB, DE (DOV); 03 April 2006 photo (c) United States Air Force / Doug Curran; Dover AFB, DE (DOV); 03 April 2006 photo (c) United States Air Force / Doug Curran; Dover AFB, DE (DOV); 03 April 2006 photo (c) United States Air Force / Jason Minto; Dover AFB, DE (DOV); 03 April 2006 photo (c) Kalle Jungk; Frankfurt International Airport (FRA); July 1998 photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Raleigh/Durham Airport, NC (RDU); May 1994 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

Fragments from the burst disk partially severed the LPT case and struck the fuselage in multiple locations. The airframe vibration increased to a severe level until the LPT rotor separated from the engine, about 14 minutes 30 seconds after the uncontained LPT stage 1 disk burst, when the high pressure turbine aft shaft and the fan mid shaft failed due to contact damage and torsional loading. Metallurgical examination of the portion of the LPT stage 1 disk that was imbedded in the right wing found that the disk burst due to a mixture of high cycle and low cycle fatigue. The fracture was located in the vicinity of the forward seal tooth serration, although the exact fracture origin could not be identified because the entire seal tooth and part of the seal tooth arm were missing at the fracture location. Examination of the forward seal tooth serration revealed the presence of two previous weld repairs that extended into the forward arm. Review of the manufacturing records revealed that the disk had been dabber weld repaired twice to correct anomalies and non-conformances found during the original manufacturing process. The dabber weld procedures did not authorize welding in the forward seal tooth serration, therefore, the weld repair performed on the failed LPT stage 1 disk did not conform to the approved repair instructions. Based on testing and analysis of sample, post-manufacture dabber weld repaired disks, the suspect population of CF6 disks was confined to those that had been repaired at original manufacture. Records indicated that, in addition to the accident disk, four other disks had been dabber weld repaired at original manufacture to correct forward seal tooth serration anomalies and non-conformances. None of these disks are any longer in service. Based on the estimated crack propagation rate, it is likely that either no crack existed at the last inspection of the disk or the crack size was below the reasonably detectable threshold. After the disk burst, the flight crew completed all required checklists; however, the crew could not manually shutdown the affected engine because the burst disk fragments had severed the fire shutoff valve cable, the power off cable, and the emergency shutoff cable. The engine eventually shutdown on its own due to airflow disruptions within the engine. The flight crewâs procedural coordination and use of available resources, consistent with cockpit resource management best practices, helped to ensure the safe landing of the airplane. Probable Cause: The rupture of a fatigue crack in the forward air seal tooth serration of the No. 3 engine low pressure turbine stage 1 disk that initiated due to an improper weld repair performed during original manufacture. The improper weld repair changed the material properties of the disk near the weld feature, resulting in an accelerated crack propagation rate that allowed the crack to grow to rupture before the next inspection interval. Contributing to the severity of the accident was the inability of the flight crew to shutdown the engine as a result of the damage caused by a liberated piece of the low pressure turbine stage 1 disk when it punctured the right wing.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA06FA033 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: NTSB: https://www.ntsb.gov/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/brief.aspx?ev_id=20060504X00511&key=1 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates03-May-2014 10:28 Katonk2014 Added 05-Dec-2017 10:12 ASN Update Bot Updated [Time, Cn, Operator, Other fatalities, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

Before the 12th takeoff the pilot allowed to two unauthorized persons to go on board, an 11-year old boy, who occupied a right seat, and a 22-year old man, who was standing behind the seats. Takeoff was performed at 14:51. During the left turn at a speed of 140-150 km/h the An-2 descended from altitude of 5-10 m, struck the ground, left lower wing first, crashed and was destroyed by fire. Both adult men were killed while the boy suffered the serious injures. MAIN CAUSE: Demonstrated self-sufficiency and lack of self-discipline by the aircraft commander, lead to violation of the flight rules during AW, defined in Aerial Works Instruction, due to which the complicated flight conditions became dangerous and in the specific circumstances the situation created developed to a catastrophic one. IMMEDIATE CAUSE: Collision with the terrain. The commission considered that for the occurrence contributed the following contributory factors: 1. Negligence of the requirements for available regular flying staff by Air Operator for the established by AOM flight conditions for minimum crew during AW. 2. Degraded level of control by Air Operator on the activities, character and quality of the aerial work performed. 3. Lack of in-depth analysis of the personal and professional abilities of the flight personnel of the Air Operator and passivity displayed in cases directly influencing the safe performing of the flights. During the process of the cause about the accident the commission disclosed also the following deficiencies: 1. Formal attitude of the inspector during the fulfillment of the control list of the aircraft commander for the flight proficiency and navigation check. 2. Lack of record in the aircraft engine technical book for installation of a plug No 105975 into the altitude corrector during the technical measures for PSSE. 3.

The airplane was traveling down a taxiway toward the active runway, and upon reaching an intersection, the captain noticed a loose string of baggage carts moving rapidly toward the airplane in an angled path from left to right.  He swerved the airplane to the right of the centerline in an effort to avoid collision with the baggage carts.  The lead rolling baggage cart struck the airplane's left wing, and the airplane traveled about 150 feet further down the taxiway before coming to a complete stop.  The lead baggage cart came to rest wedged between the wing and taxiway surface.  The airplane sustained substantial damage.  The string of carts came from the direction of the concourse D gates 10 through 14.  The baggage carts were equipped with a manual towbar actuated front two-wheel brake system.  The parking brake is designed to activate by the operator raising the towbar to the vertical position.  To release the parking brake, the brake/towbar-latch is pushed down by foot while the top of the tow bar is pushed inward toward the cart until the brake/towbar-latch is unhooked.  Northwest Airlines, the owner of runaway carts, issued an employee memorandum after the accident reiterating the importance of ensuring that the braking system is engaged when leaving carts unattended.

Armavia flight 967 departed Yerevan (EVN) at 00:47 on a scheduled flight to Sochi (AER). Weather at Sochi was poor with rain and poor visibility. Radio contact with Sochi was established at 01:10. The flight crew discussed the current weather conditions at Sochi with the approach controller. At 01:26 the crew decided to return to Yerevan due to the below minima weather conditions at Sochi. At 01:30 the crew again requested the latest weather information. Visibility now was reported as 3600 m with a cloud base at 170 m. The captain now decided to continue to Sochi instead. Clearance was give to descent to an altitude of 3600 m. At 02:00 further descent instructions for 1800 m were issued by the air traffic controller. Weather conditions for an approach to runway 06 were now equal to the airport minima. Sochi Tower then cleared the flight to descend to 600 m. The glideslope was captured and the gear was lowered at 02:10. The crew reported ready and where cleared for landing. Weather was reported as 4000 m visibility with a cloud base at 190 m. Weather deteriorated quickly and thirty seconds later the controller reported that the cloud base was now at 100 m. He instructed the flight to abort the approach and told the crew to make a climbing right hand turn to an altitude of 600 m. The aircraft was flying at 300 m and performed a climbing turn to 450 m. Simultaneously the groundspeed dropped and the Airbus descended until it contacted the water and broke up. Wreckage sank to a depth of 700 m. CONCLUSION: ""The fatal crash of the Armavia A-320 EK-32009 was a CFIT accident that happened due to collision with the water while carrying-out a climbing manoeuvre after an aborted approach to Sochi airport at night with weather conditions below the established minima for runway 06. While performing the climb with the autopilot disengaged, the Captain, being in a psychoemotional stress condition, made nose down control inputs due to the loss of pitch and roll awareness. This started the abnormal situation. Subsequently the Captain's inputs in the pitch channel were insufficient to prevent development of the abnormal situation into the catastrophic one. Along with the inadequate control inputs of the Captain, the contributing factors to development of the abnormal situation into the catastrophic one were also the lack of necessary monitoring of the aircraft descent parameters (pitch attitude, altitude, vertical speed) by the co-pilot and the absence of proper reaction by the crew to the EGPWS warning.METAR: 22:00 UTC / 02:00 local time: URSS 022200Z VRB01MPS 4000 -SHRA BR BKN006 OVC027CB 11/11 Q1018 TEMRO 1500 BR VV005 RMK G/~Z QFE762 SC05=wind variable at 1m/sec, visibility 4000m, light rain showers, mist 5-7 oktas cloud at 600ft, 8 oktas overcast cloud at 2700ft with thunder clouds, temperature 11C dewpoint 11C, QNH 1018hPa, visibility 1500m mist vertical visibility 500ftAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: - Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   Gazeta.ru  MAK Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC)  Ministry of Emergency Situations (MChS) of Russia History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  1 May 2005 EK32009 Armavia 0 Moskva-Vnukovo Airport (VKO) min Runway excursion Location  Images: photo (c) Avianet.de (Ralf Hoffmann); Amsterdam-Schiphol Airport (AMS); 16 October 2005 photo (c) Ger Buskermolen; Amsterdam-Schiphol Airport (AMS); 22 May 2005 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates18-Feb-2025 08:31 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The car collided with the right wing of the aircraft, which was stopped at the H1 holding point of runway 30. In the preceding minutes, an Alitalia aircraft, with call sign AZ085, had taken off for Milan. After takeoff, IB1343 was cleared to enter runway 30 and ANS8831 was cleared to taxi to the H1 holding point vacated by IB1343.  The Alitalia aircraft radioed, two minutes before the accident, to report a possible loss of an object during takeoff, advising a runway check. The controller called the signalman for an check of runway 12/30. The signalman moved with the car from the base house, along taxiway A to H1 to access the runway from there, and the accident occurred at this waiting point.  Causes It is considered that the collision of the signaling service vehicle with the EC-JEN aircraft, which was stopped at the H1 holding point, occurred because the signaller was not aware of the presence of the aircraft. The signaling car had been authorized by the Valencia Airport aerodrome control service to access the H1 holding point without having been informed of the presence of the EC-JEN aircraft, which in turn had been authorized to taxi to the same point minutes earlier. Possible influencing factors in the accident are considered to be: - Glare effect exerted by the road running to the left and converging with taxiway A when, in night light conditions, taxiing from the north apron to standby point H1. - Aircraft logo lights off, limiting visibility to the rear, especially in areas close to the runway. - Incorrect execution of runway inspection procedures. - Excessive speed of the signaling vehicle in the movement area. - Movement of the signaling vehicle along the edge of the taxiway. - Decreased visibility of the accident area from the control tower due to light conditions and the presence of trees. - Decreased attention in both controller and signalman due to: * A low workload environment, with perceived absence of threats and no demanding demands due to the high degree of experience on the job, and. * Work shifts that disrupt daytime cycles of activity.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIAIAC Report number: A-002/2006 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: CIAIAC Ref.

Airline station personnel had received authorization to call contract maintenance to investigate the oil leak from one of the airline's senior maintenance controllers.  As a result, three mechanics from a fixed base operator (FBO) at the airport were called by the airline station personnel.  The FBO had previously entered into an agreement with the airline to provide contract maintenance at the airport.   All of the airline's maintenance manuals were maintained at the airline's headquarters maintenance control base.  According to the airline's procedures, extracts of those manuals with specific procedures were required to be transmitted prior to the contractor performing maintenance, and only after authorization by the airline's maintenance control.   After becoming concerned about the delay in hearing back regarding the investigation into the engine leak, a senior maintenance controller for the airline attempted to contact airline station personnel, and the FBO, several times to determine what instructions and authorizations would be needed.  The investigation revealed that the FBO did not make contact with the airline to obtain the requested maintenance approval and required documentation to work on the engine.     Meanwhile, both sides of the engine fan cowl panels were opened by the mechanics to conduct the engine inspection and check for leaks.  The mechanics made a request to the captain (via ground-to-cockpit intercom system) for an engine run to check for the leak source.  One mechanic positioned himself on the inboard side of the right engine and the other mechanic on the outboard side of the engine.  The third mechanic was positioned clear of the engine because he was assigned to observe the procedure as part of his on-the-job training.   The engine was started and stabilized at idle RPM for approximately 3 minutes while the initial leak check was performed by the two journeymen mechanics that were working around the engine.  One of these two mechanics then called the captain on the ground intercom system and reported that a small oil leak was detected, and he requested that the captain run the engine at 70 percent power for 2 minutes to conduct further checks.  The captain complied with the request, after verifying with the mechanic that the area around the airplane was clear.   Witnesses on the ground and in the airplane stated that they saw the mechanic on the outboard side of the engine stand up, step into the inlet hazard zone, and become ingested into the intake of the engine.  This occurred about 90 seconds into the 70-percent-power engine run.  The mechanic was not wearing any type of safety equipment or lanyard to prevent the ingestion.  Upon sensing a buffet, the captain immediately retarded the power lever back to the idle position.  The first officer stated to the captain that something went into the engine and the captain immediately cut off the start lever to stop the engine run.   The mechanic who was fatally injured was hired by the FBO in November 1997, and had been a certified mechanic for 40 years.   He received maintenance training from the airline regarding on-call maintenance procedures in March 2004, nearly two years prior to the accident.  The airline provided training to contract maintenance stations in the form of classroom instruction, interactive computer based scenarios, and training videos.  Specific training (either initial or recurrent) regarding ground engine runs and associated hazards was not provided to the contract mechanics by the airline. According to the surviving contract mechanic that worked around the engine with the fatally injured mechanic, maintenance instructions were not needed for the engine run because engine oil leaks were a common occurrence, and because of his past experience as a mechanic. Under the section entitled ""Engine Run Rules - General"" i Probable Cause: the mechanic's failure to maintain proper clearance with the engine intake during a jet engine run, and the failure of contract maintenance personnel to follow written procedures and directives contained in the airline's general maintenance manual.  Factors contributing to the accident were the insufficient training provided to the contract mechanics by the airline, and the failure of the airport to disseminate a policy prohibiting ground engine runs above idle power in the terminal area.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DFW06FA056 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: NTSB: https://www.ntsb.gov/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/brief.aspx?ev_id=20060131X00140&key=1  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates30-Apr-2014 07:03 Katonk2014 Added 03-May-2014 10:29 Katonk2014 Updated [Total fatalities, ]21-Dec-2016 19:28 ASN Update Bot Updated [Time, Damage, Category, Investigating agency, ]05-Dec-2017 09:00 ASN Update Bot Updated [Cn, Operator, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, ]28-Aug-2024 16:11 Anon.

On board the aircraft were two Mozambican pilots, accompanied by two paramedics, an elderly male patient with a fractured hip secured to a stretcher and the patient's wife. The pilot-in-command who was also the pilot flying stated that after an uneventful flight, he executed a normal landing on Runway 06L at Lanseria International Aerodrome. He then selected reverse thrust on both engines but during the landing roll, the pilot not flying notified him that the left-hand main landing gear, down and locked light went out and the red landing gear unsafe warning light had illuminated. Shortly thereafter the left-hand wing started to drop and whilst the pilot attempted to maintain directional control, he requested the non flying pilot to shut down the engines. The aircraft veered off the runway onto the grass area next to the runway before coming to rest on the grass area. The pilots, passenger, paramedics and patient sustained no injuries during the accident however the aircraft sustained damage to the left-hand main landing gear, left-hand engine, left-hand propeller, left-hand landing gear doors and left-hand outboard and inboard flaps. The last Phase Inspection prior to the accident was certified on 27 March 2005 at 21152 airframe hours. At the time of the accident the aircraft had accumulated a further 186 airframe hours since the last phase inspection was certified. Probable Cause The left-hand undercarriage support arm draglink upper attachment bolt failed during the landing and the pilot was unable to maintain directional control of the aircraft. The aircraft veered off the runway to the left.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CAA S.A.

The aircraft did not make it and crashed in the woods, some 10 km from the airport. CONCLUSIONS FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1. The engine lost power when a compressor turbine blade failed as a result of the overstress extension of a fatigue-generated crack. The fracture initiated at a metallurgical anomaly in the parent blade material and progressed, eventually resulting in blade failure due to overstress rupture. 2. The combination of aircraft position at the time of the engine failure, the lack of equipment enabling the pilot to locate and identify high terrain, and the resultant manoeuvring required to avoid entering instrument flight conditions likely prevented the pilot from attempting to glide to the nearest airfield. FINDINGS AS TO RISK: 1. Single-engine instrument flight rules (SEIFR) operations in designated mountainous regions have unique obstacle risks in the event of an engine failure. Canadian equipment requirements for such operations do not currently include independent terrain mapping, such as terrain awareness and warning systems (TAWS). 2. Airline operators are not currently required to conduct any additional route evaluation or structuring to ensure that the risk of an off-field landing is minimized during SEIFR operations. 3. Pilots involved in commercial SEIFR operations do not receive training in how to conduct a forced landing under instrument flight conditions; such training would likely improve a pilot's ability to respond to an engine failure when operating in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC). 4. Mean time between failure (MTBF) calculations do not take into account In Flight Shut Downs (IFSDs) not directly attributable to the engine itself; it may be more appropriate to monitor all IFSD events. 5. The design of the Cessna 208B Caravan fuel shutoff valves increases the risk that the valves will open on impact, allowing fuel spillage and increasing the potential for fire.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: TSB Report A06P001 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: CADORS Number: 2006P0080   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane climbed to its assigned cruising altitude of FL380, which was reached at about 06:06 MST. The descend for Carlsbad was started an hour later, at 06:06 PST. Air traffic control cleared the flightcrew for the ILS approach to runway 24, which was 4,897 feet long. The flightcrew then reported that they had the runway in sight, cancelled their IFR clearance, and executed a VFR approach in VFR conditions to the airport. The reported winds favoured a landing toward the east, onto the opposite runway (runway 6). During the approach, after a query from the first officer, the captain indicated to the first officer that he was going to ""...land to the east,"" consistent with the reported winds. However, the final approach and subsequent landing were made to runway 24, which produced a six-knot tailwind. During the approach sequence the captain maintained an airspeed that was approximately 30 knots higher than the correct airspeed for the aircraft's weight, resulting in the aircraft touching down about 1,500 feet further down the runway than normal, and much faster than normal. The captain then delayed the initiation of a go-around until the first officer asked if they were going around. Although the aircraft lifted off the runway surface prior to departing the paved overrun during the delayed go-around it impacted a localizer antenna platform, whose highest non-frangible structure was located approximately 304 feet past the end of the runway, and approximately two feet lower than the terrain at the departure end of the runway. The aircraft continued airborne as it flew over downsloping terrain for about 400 more feet before colliding with the terrain and a commercial storage building that was located at an elevation approximately 80 feet lower than the terrain at the end of the runway. The localizer antenna platform was located outside of the designated runway safety area, and met all applicable FAA siting requirements. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The captain's delayed decision to execute a balked landing (go-around) during the landing roll. Factors contributing to the accident include the captain's improper decision to land with a tailwind, his excessive airspeed on final approach, and his failure to attain a proper touchdown point during landing.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: SEA06MA047 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; GenÃ¨ve-Cointrin Airport (GVA/LSGG); June 1999 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The crew cycled the gear back down and got a ""three green"" normal indication. They cycled the gear back up and again got the ""gear unsafe"" light. They cycled the gear three more times with the same results. The crew decided to return to Asheville, and upon extending the gear for a visual landing at Asheville, the right main landing gear green light did not illuminate. The crew stated that they performed all of the checklist procedures and asked the control tower personnel to visually look to see if the gear was down and that tower personnel reported that it was. The crew asked the tower personnel if the landing light was on, and tower personnel replied that is was not. According to the flight crew, they went through the emergency procedures again, but they had no luck in getting the landing gear to lock down. They said that there was no landing light and that they got the gear horn with the gear down and full flaps with the throttles at idle. The crew stated they were sure that the gear was out of the uplocks but not down and locked. The crew stated that, after talking with maintenance personnel on the ground at Asheville, they decided to divert to Greensboro/High Point-Piedmont Triad International Airport, NC (GSO), where there were better facilities to handle the situation.

Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed and a visual flight rules flight plan was filed. The airline transport-rated pilot, and five passengers received fatal injuries and the airplane was destroyed.  The multi-engine airplane rolled inverted and dove into the ground on a landing approach. According to witnesses, the airplane made two approaches to runway 23. During the first approach the airplane was observed, ""fish tailing"" while about 30 feet over the runway. The airplane appeared to regain control and continued flying over the runway until passing the air traffic control tower, at which time the airplane began a climbing left turn. The witnesses stated that they heard the pilot tell the air traffic controller that he was doing a go-around. The controller asked the pilot if he had problems with the sea fog. The pilot responded back to the controller ""no that his left engine kept power up a little too much and would not come back."" The witnesses observed the airplane circle the airport to the left, and watched it line up on runway 23 for the second time. The witnesses stated that as the airplane descended to the runway and without any indication of trouble, the airplane ""climbed and rolled left, went inverted and nosed down into the grass to the left of the runway and burst into flames."" Examination of the airplane, airplane systems, engines, and propellers found no abnormal pre-impact conditions that would have interfered with the normal operation of the airplane.

The pilot said overhauled brake assemblies had been installed before the accident.  He complained that the brakes felt ""spongy"" and the pedals went ""almost to the floor, requiring two or three additional pumps for a hard pedal.""  He was told that this was ""normal"" since the airplane was not equipped with power brakes or anti-skid.  The brakes were removed and sent to the overhaul facility.  They found that both brake assemblies each had one return mechanism binding.  The return mechanism had a self adjusting friction bushing meant to slip along the return pin at a predetermined spring pressure.  As pressure was applied to the brake, the pressure plate extended toward the number one rotor, pulling the return pins through the swage and tube assemblies and compressing the return springs.  Although the swage should move through the tube, one swage on each brake was not moving freely.  The brake travel went further than normal because ""normal travel"" was never set. Probable Cause: mechanical binding of the normal brake system, rendering directional control impossible.  Contributing factors were the improper overhaul, inadequate quality control procedures by the overhaul facility, and the rough terrain.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: MIA06LA052 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: NTSB MIA06LA052 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates09-Oct-2022 07:08 ASN Update Bot Added 17-Nov-2022 00:01 Ron Averes Updated [Aircraft type, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

En route over Germany at FL380 the flight attendant inadvertently set off a smoke canister, intended for emergencies, in the cabin. The cabin and cockpit filled with smoke. At 19:22 hours local time the crew declared an emergency and requested an immediate descent. The flight was overhead Kiel and the crew decided to make an emergency landing there. The aircraft landed on runway 26 (4134 feet / 1265 m long) but overran the runway end and fell down an embankment. Conclusions (translated from German report): The accident is attributable to the following: Immediate causes: - Unintentional ignition of a pyrotechnic distress signal in the passenger cabin - Emergency caused by fire and smoke - Misunderstandings in communication - Failure to use reverse thrust or braking parachute and insufficient use of the wheel brakes Systemic causes: - Improper storage of pyrotechnic signaling means on board - Inadequate training of the crew by the air carriers regarding the emergency equipment.Sources: DPA  Izvestiya   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

During the landing rollout, the airplane ""swerved"" to the right with application of brakes.  The pilot corrected back to the runway centerline with rudder.  He applied brakes again and the airplane again ""swerved"" to the right.  He again corrected back to the runway centerline and applied the brakes a third time.  The airplane again ""swerved"" to the right.  He then applied the emergency brake.  The airplane departed the right side of the runway and struck the concrete pad of a runway marker sign. An FAA inspector reported finding hydraulic fluid covering the left main landing gear.  He said the main and auxiliary left brake lines were both fractured, and the right main landing gear tire was ""shredded off the wheel.""  According to NTSB's Materials Laboratory Factual Report, the brake line transmits hydraulic fluid and the auxiliary brake line transmits compressed nitrogen.  Both brake line fractures were the result of fatigue cracking.  No mechanical or other damage was evident on the exterior of the line in the initiation area. Maintenance records dating back to the airplane's date of manufacture revealed the brake lines had never been removed or replaced. Probable Cause: Failure of both the left main and auxiliary brake lines due to fatigue cracking, rendering directional control impossible.  A contributing factor in this accident was the airport sign concrete pad.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: MIA06LA057 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB MIA06LA057 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates09-Oct-2022 07:01 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

The member of ground staff whose responsibility it was to ensure that the stand was unobstructed, was unable to see the whole stand from his assigned position in the jetty. Members of ground staff who saw the potential conflict were unable to alert the pilots. Three safety recommendations were made. Conclusion The right wingtip of the aircraft struck a van which was parked in an area of the stand which should have been free from all obstructions. The driver of the van was aware that he should not park there and had intended to move to a different position prior to the arrival of the aircraft. Congestion in the baggage handling area of the stand prevented him from doing so. The pilots were aware that the van was parked incorrectly but elected to continue onto the stand, believing that it would not be an obstacle. This would have been the case if the aircraft had been lined up on the stand centreline before entering the stand. However, the commander, aware of the confined nature of the stand, made a tighter turn onto the stand than that indicated by the lead-in line painted on the ground and remained at all times to the right of the stand centreline.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: EW/C2006/02/02 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5422f94340f0b613420006a9/Boeing_737-45D__SP-LLB_01-07.pdf  https://www.jetphotos.com/photo/435550 (Photo) History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  26 May 2011 SP-LLB LOT Polskie Linie Lotnicze 0 Brussel-Zaventem Airport (BRU/EBBR) sub Gear collapse 29 December 2019 N803TJ Swift Air 0 NW of San Jose , CA min Engine failure Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates03-Feb-2025 07:10 Justanormalperson Added 03-Feb-2025 07:13 ASN Updated [Narrative, Accident report, ] Corrections or additions? ...

When the pilots, after several tries, did not manage to get normal function of the landing gear they requested to go back and land at the departure airport. During the return flight the pilots requested to make a low fly-by over the airport to try to get the position of the landing gear checked from the ground by airport personnel. This was accepted and the aircraft made an ILS approach 1 to runway 03 and levelled out at 200â300 above ground level. The low pass was made parallel to runway 03 and approximately halfway between the runway and the control tower. After the fly-by, during which the pilots heard that staff on the ground thought that all the landing gear was lowered, they decided to land on runway 03. A smooth landing was achieved on the main gear at about 100 knots IAS and with the nose wheel in the air. The nose wheel remained extended for about 2.5 seconds after its first contact with the ground, and then the nose wheel gear folded forwards towards its retracted state. The nose of the aircraft hit the runway and the aircraft slid further, supported by its nose and the main landing gear for about 300 meters before it stopped. No one onboard was injured and the evacuation was made via slides.  During the evacuation one of the cabin crew, a female, had difficulties to lock the rear left door in full open position which made the evacuation difficult. The technical investigation has showed that a grease-nipple on the nose wheel locking mechanism was blocked resulting in insufficient lubrication causing the mechanism to jam. Furthermore the Board has noted that the certification requirements for emergency evacuation from an inclined aircraft do not contain a requirement for the door to be capable of being secured in the open position. The accident was caused by seizure of the nose wheel locking mechanism as a result of a blocked grease nipple, which prevented correct lubrication.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: SHK Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SHK Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates14-Dec-2024 15:34 ASN Added Corrections or additions? ...

The operator reported that after the airplane's engines had been started, it was discovered that a baby stroller had not been off-loaded.  The station agents notified the captain, who shut down the left engine.  An agent accessed the cargo compartment, located at the left, rear portion of the airplane.  While he was exiting the compartment, the station agent lost his balance and dropped the stroller onto the ramp.  The stroller landed on its wheels and was blown under the fuselage by the wind and into the right main landing gear.  The stroller was subsequently blown forward into the right propeller arc, where the operating propeller struck it.  Fragments from the stroller impacted the airplane's fuselage, puncturing three holes and causing several dents in the pressurized fuselage.  The wind speed was about 20 knots, gusting to 31 knots, at the time of the accident. Probable Cause: The station agent's inability to maintain control of the stroller when he lost his balance exiting the airplane's cargo compartment, allowing it to be blown into the operating right propeller.

One flight attendant located in the aft galley sustained serious injuries.  The passengers and remaining crew were not injured.  The aircraft was not damaged.  The captain reported that the airplane was established in cruise at FL390 with smooth air conditions.  She stated that the turbulence encounter began with a ""slight buffet"" and ""rapidly increasing"" airspeed.  She attempted to maintain cruise airspeed by decreasing engine power and climbing to a higher altitude.  She noted that as she initiated the climb, the aircraft experienced moderate turbulence.  She reported that as the airplane reached FL400, the airspeed began a ""rapid decrease"" and she initiated a descent back to FL390.  The flight subsequently descended to FL350 before the conditions smoothed out.  She noted that the turbulence was encountered ""suddenly and without warning.""  The flight data recorder indicated that the airspeed increased from 236 knots to 273 knots during the encounter.  A vertical acceleration spike of 1.81 g's, followed by 0.61 g's, was recorded 64 seconds after the initial increase in airspeed. The weather forecast provided to the crew listed a risk of moderate turbulence between 20,000  and 38,000 feet. While ATC communications were describing light turbulence and moderate chop at lower altitudes, no reports from ATC, company dispatch, or other aircraft were received regarding mountain wave activity or turbulence at 39,000 feet. Probable Cause: An inadvertent encounter with unforecast mountain wave turbulence during cruise flight.  A contributing factor was the mountain wave (terrain induced) turbulence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CHI06LA099 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB CHI06LA099  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates25-Mar-2024 09:10 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

The aircraft was cleared for the VOR B approach to Butte at 14:48. A weather front had been approaching the area from the south to the north/northeast. Weather conditions included icing conditions followed by heavy snow fall with poor visibility and variable winds in the mountains.  According to the approach plate, the transition to the approach is via a DME arc at 9,000 feet with no procedure turn. The flight is to track inbound on the 127 degree radial, descending down to, but no lower than, 7,700 feet to the initial approach fix (IAF). After crossing the IAF, the flight is to turn to 097 degrees for 10 nautical miles and descend to 6,900 feet. The remainder of the 1.5 nautical miles to the runway is to be flown under visual conditions.  During the descent the airplane collided with trees and subsequently the mountainous terrain on a heading of approximately 127 degrees and about 6,900 feet mean sea level.

The weather in Seville at the time of arrival was forecast to be stormy with variable rain and winds. The visibility, reduced by the heavy rain, was in excess of 2,000 m (RVR) at the runway 27 threshold. The runway in use at Seville was runway 27, which had CAT I visual and precision radio navigation landing aids. While in autopilot, the aircraft captured the ILS localizer as it neared Seville, at a distance of 11 NM from the runway 27 threshold. Flight 2652 was cleared to land on runway 27 some nine minutes prior to its arrival time and before descending below the transition level, which was at 7,500 ft above sea level. The control tower reported the wind about three minutes prior to landing, which at that time was from 240Â° at 15 kt. The runway was wet and it was raining heavily. The crew was told to proceed on course to Seville at their discretion and in accordance with their procedures. With the tower's clearance, they captured the glideslope early, far above the 2,000 ft specified in the published AIP procedure and descended along the ILS glideslope without significant deviations from the localize and glidepath until they were below 1,000 ft AGL and with the runway in sight. Established on the glideslope with the gear down and flaps 30Â°, they disengaged the autopilot at about 700 ft and shortly thereafter they started to climb above the glideslope. The aircraft then descended to the runway at very high descent rates. The EGPWS SINK RATE and PULL-UP warnings sounded shortly before touchdown. The airplane landed in the middle of an intense rain storm. Personnel in the control tower saw a flame or glow on the right side of the aircraft. During the hard impact with the runway at the aiming point, some 300 m beyond the threshold, the right main gear leg collapsed, pivoting backwards and partially detaching. The crew was able to maintain steering control of the aircraft, which came to a stop after a 900-m landing run. Full reverse thrusters were used to decelerate the airplane. The entire landing roll took place on the paved runway surface. Only at the end of the run did part of the airplane, the right wingtip, touch the ground in an area beyond the paved asphalt. After coming to a stop, and lacking the support from the right leg, the aircraft was being held up by its left leg and right engine, which is forward of the airplane's center of gravity, as a result of which the aircraft tilted backwards until the tail touched the ground during the final seconds of braking. There was no fuel leak and no fire. The captain gave the evacuation order, which was carried out using the four doors on both sides of the airplane. Due to the final nose-up pitch of the aircraft, the front doors were at a significant height above the ground. As a result, the emergency evacuation ramps were inclined at an excessive angle that hindered the exit of the airplane's occupants. Causes: ""The accident was caused by a very hard landing of the aircraft, during which the right main landing gear was broken, as a consequence of a non stabilized approach.

During the approach to runway 32R at Domodedovo Airport the airspeed was higher than recommended. The aircraft crossed the threshold at an altitude of 12 m and a speed of 304 km/h. During the flare, at an altitude of about 5 meters, the captain instructed the flight engineer to bring back the thrust levers to idle. The flight engineer confirmed selected all four engines to idle. The captain subsequently called for the thrust reversers to be deployed but the flight engineer did not confirm this instruction but asked again: ""Turn on the reverse?"".  The reverser buckets were then deployed, but the engines were not brought to the maximum reverse thrust. It is possible that at this moment the flight engineer was distracted. The aircraft floated at an altitude of 1-0.5 m over the runway. As a result, the landing of the aircraft occurred at a distance of 1100 m from the threshold end of the runway at a speed of 258 km/h. Before landing, the captain again instructed to turn on the reverse of the engines. A misunderstanding between the captain and flight engineer and subsequent actions by the flight engineer caused the two engines to be operated at full power with reversers stowed. The aircraft overran the end of the runway of runway 32R and continued for 680 meters before it collided with a slope of the ravine. The accident occurred as a result of erroneous actions by the flight engineer during operations to turn on the engine reverse when landing the plane, expressed in shifting the reverse buckets to direct thrust and putting the 1st and 4th engines to take-off mode after landing. The Commission concluded that the flight engineerÂs erroneous actions were facilitated by: - a low level of technological discipline in the crew due to the weak role of the captain as a leader in the crew, which was manifested in the crew members not fully fulfilling the ""Instructions for the interaction and technology of the crew members of the IL-62M aircraft"" and Aircraft Flight Manual during descent, approach and landing; - emotional relaxation of the crew at the end of a business trip and return to base; - lack of effective control, including according to the data of flight recorders over flight operations with LIBAVIA; - in the ""Instructions for the interaction and technology of the crew of the IL-62M aircraft"" there are no control functions on the part of other crew members for the actions of the flight engineer at the stage of aircraft landing and the status of the reverse  on/off alarm; - the absence in the training programs of the simulator of exercises for practicing the actions of crew members in case of erroneous actions by the flight engineer when the reverse is turned on; - lack of equipment for the flight engineerÂs workplace with a radio headset, lack of procedures in the ""Instructions for Interaction and the Work Technology of the Crew Members of the Il-62M Aircraft"" for the use of a radio headset for flight personnel in flights with a reduced crew; - excessive volume of the SSU speakers broadcasting external radio communications, which created additional difficulties when listening to the commands given by the captain; - fuzziness (illegibility) of the commands given by the PIC and the lack of response of the PIC to the non-confirmation of the commands given by him to the flight engineer.METAR: 16:30 UTC / 20:30 local time: UUDD 291630Z 17002MPS 2400 -RA BR BKN004 OVC100 03/02 Q1002 TEMPO 0500 FG =17:00 UTC / 21:00 local time: UUDD 291700Z 19002MPS 160V230 1800 -RA BR BKN004 OVC10003/02 Q1002 EMPO 0500 FG = Sources: MAK Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC)  Russian Ministry of Transport   Location  Images: photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; ?; January 2001 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane was expected to arrive at 18:02. After takeoff the crew requested cancellation of their IFR flight plan ant to continue under visual flight rules at FL45. This was approved. Upon request, the flight was cleared to descend to 2000 feet to avoid an area of poor weather. About 17:39 a left turn was initiated towards the coast line for the same reason. The airplane struck trees near the top of Pico da Pedra Bonita at an elevation of 1920 feet. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS (translated from Portuguese) 1. Human factors Psychological - Contributed It was found that the decision of the crew to cancel the IFR plan to continue VFR at low altitude and when visibility is not favorable, has been inadequate, with compliance of the pilots with such a decision. It is possible that the knowledge of the region obtained by the instructor captain caused over-confidence, influencing the decision. The organizational culture of the company proved to be complacent by not inhibiting the adoption of procedures incompatible with flight safety, such as the low altitude flights made by the instructor captain. Operational Aspect a. Judgement - Contributed There was inadequate assessment of the situation by the crew, causing them to fly at a lower altitude than the safe limits under visual conditions unsuitable for visual flight, resulting in the collision of the aircraft with high ground. b. Coordination Cabin - Contributed The use of human resources for the operation of the aircraft was unsuitable because of failure to comply with operational standards, leading the crew to perform a passenger flight to the lower altitude limits of safety, under inadequate visual conditions. c. Planning - Contributed The preparation for the flight proved inadequate because the crew did not have a meteorological analysis of the appropriate level of flight performed, considering that the conditions for the region were overshadowing the Serra do Mar and surrounding areas of low clouds and / or mist, especially on the slopes of the mountain. d. Adverse weather conditions - Contributors The weather conditions prevailing in the region made visual flight impossible, resulting in the concealment of the elevation at which the aircraft crashed. e. Flight indiscipline - Contributed The pilots intentionally not complying with rules of air traffic and civil aviation rules, without grounds, performing flight at low altitude, under conditions of visibility below the limits established for VFR flight, colliding with high ground. f Supervision - Contributed The company has not taken appropriate supervisory measures, enabling the existence of a culture of undeveloped flight safety, which prevented advance identification of actions taken by the crew and injured misconception exists in the CRM business, which represented a potential risk to their operations, as well as by the failure of some educational measures provided for in its PPAA (Plan for the Prevention of Aeronautical Accidents). 2 Material Factor Not contributed.

About ten minutes after takeoff the aircrew observed a No. 2 engine ""Thrust Reverser Not Locked"" indication light. They shut down the No. 2 engine as a precaution and decided to return to Dover. During the return the pilots and flight engineers continued to use the shut-down No. 2 engineÂs throttle while leaving the fully-operational No. 3 engine in idle. Also, the wrong flap setting was used. On final approach to runway 32, the airplane descended below the normal glidepath. The C-5 stalled , hit a utility pole and crashed into a field. The tail separated and the C-5 crash-landed further on. The nose section separated due to the impact.

PROBABLE CAUSE: ""Based on clear and convincing evidence, the Board President determined the primary cause of the mishap was the pilots' and flight engineers' failure to use the number three, fully operational, engine; the instructor's and primary flight engineer's failure to brief, and the pilots' failure to consider or utilize a 62.5 or 40% flap setting (instead of a 100% flap setting); and the pilots' attempt at a visual approach to runway 32, descending well below a normal glidepath for an instrument-aided approach or the normal VFR pattern altitude of 1,800 ft. There is substantial evidence that a contributing factor to this mishap was MP1's failure to give a complete approach briefing, in that, nonstandard factors, configuration, landing distance, and missed approach intentions were not addressed.""Sources: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AIRCRAFT ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION C-5B, S/N 84-0059 512th Airlift Wing, Dover Air Force Base, Delaware 3 April 2006 / USAF   Location  Images: photo (c) United States Air Force / Doug Curran; Dover AFB, DE (DOV); 03 April 2006 photo (c) United States Air Force / Doug Curran; Dover AFB, DE (DOV); 03 April 2006 photo (c) United States Air Force / Doug Curran; Dover AFB, DE (DOV); 03 April 2006 photo (c) United States Air Force / Jason Minto; Dover AFB, DE (DOV); 03 April 2006 photo (c) Kalle Jungk; Frankfurt International Airport (FRA); July 1998 photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Raleigh/Durham Airport, NC (RDU); May 1994 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

Fragments from the burst disk partially severed the LPT case and struck the fuselage in multiple locations. The airframe vibration increased to a severe level until the LPT rotor separated from the engine, about 14 minutes 30 seconds after the uncontained LPT stage 1 disk burst, when the high pressure turbine aft shaft and the fan mid shaft failed due to contact damage and torsional loading. Metallurgical examination of the portion of the LPT stage 1 disk that was imbedded in the right wing found that the disk burst due to a mixture of high cycle and low cycle fatigue. The fracture was located in the vicinity of the forward seal tooth serration, although the exact fracture origin could not be identified because the entire seal tooth and part of the seal tooth arm were missing at the fracture location. Examination of the forward seal tooth serration revealed the presence of two previous weld repairs that extended into the forward arm. Review of the manufacturing records revealed that the disk had been dabber weld repaired twice to correct anomalies and non-conformances found during the original manufacturing process. The dabber weld procedures did not authorize welding in the forward seal tooth serration, therefore, the weld repair performed on the failed LPT stage 1 disk did not conform to the approved repair instructions. Based on testing and analysis of sample, post-manufacture dabber weld repaired disks, the suspect population of CF6 disks was confined to those that had been repaired at original manufacture. Records indicated that, in addition to the accident disk, four other disks had been dabber weld repaired at original manufacture to correct forward seal tooth serration anomalies and non-conformances. None of these disks are any longer in service. Based on the estimated crack propagation rate, it is likely that either no crack existed at the last inspection of the disk or the crack size was below the reasonably detectable threshold. After the disk burst, the flight crew completed all required checklists; however, the crew could not manually shutdown the affected engine because the burst disk fragments had severed the fire shutoff valve cable, the power off cable, and the emergency shutoff cable. The engine eventually shutdown on its own due to airflow disruptions within the engine. The flight crewâs procedural coordination and use of available resources, consistent with cockpit resource management best practices, helped to ensure the safe landing of the airplane. Probable Cause: The rupture of a fatigue crack in the forward air seal tooth serration of the No. 3 engine low pressure turbine stage 1 disk that initiated due to an improper weld repair performed during original manufacture. The improper weld repair changed the material properties of the disk near the weld feature, resulting in an accelerated crack propagation rate that allowed the crack to grow to rupture before the next inspection interval. Contributing to the severity of the accident was the inability of the flight crew to shutdown the engine as a result of the damage caused by a liberated piece of the low pressure turbine stage 1 disk when it punctured the right wing.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA06FA033 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: NTSB: https://www.ntsb.gov/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/brief.aspx?ev_id=20060504X00511&key=1 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates03-May-2014 10:28 Katonk2014 Added 05-Dec-2017 10:12 ASN Update Bot Updated [Time, Cn, Operator, Other fatalities, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

Before the 12th takeoff the pilot allowed to two unauthorized persons to go on board, an 11-year old boy, who occupied a right seat, and a 22-year old man, who was standing behind the seats. Takeoff was performed at 14:51. During the left turn at a speed of 140-150 km/h the An-2 descended from altitude of 5-10 m, struck the ground, left lower wing first, crashed and was destroyed by fire. Both adult men were killed while the boy suffered the serious injures. MAIN CAUSE: Demonstrated self-sufficiency and lack of self-discipline by the aircraft commander, lead to violation of the flight rules during AW, defined in Aerial Works Instruction, due to which the complicated flight conditions became dangerous and in the specific circumstances the situation created developed to a catastrophic one. IMMEDIATE CAUSE: Collision with the terrain. The commission considered that for the occurrence contributed the following contributory factors: 1. Negligence of the requirements for available regular flying staff by Air Operator for the established by AOM flight conditions for minimum crew during AW. 2. Degraded level of control by Air Operator on the activities, character and quality of the aerial work performed. 3. Lack of in-depth analysis of the personal and professional abilities of the flight personnel of the Air Operator and passivity displayed in cases directly influencing the safe performing of the flights. During the process of the cause about the accident the commission disclosed also the following deficiencies: 1. Formal attitude of the inspector during the fulfillment of the control list of the aircraft commander for the flight proficiency and navigation check. 2. Lack of record in the aircraft engine technical book for installation of a plug No 105975 into the altitude corrector during the technical measures for PSSE. 3. The reason for replacement of the cylinder No 1, 4 and 9 wasnÂt registered in the technical documentation.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIU Bulgaria Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Ministry of Transport, Aircraft Accident Investigation Unit Accident Report  Translation: Dmitriy Yertsov   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane was traveling down a taxiway toward the active runway, and upon reaching an intersection, the captain noticed a loose string of baggage carts moving rapidly toward the airplane in an angled path from left to right.  He swerved the airplane to the right of the centerline in an effort to avoid collision with the baggage carts.  The lead rolling baggage cart struck the airplane's left wing, and the airplane traveled about 150 feet further down the taxiway before coming to a complete stop.  The lead baggage cart came to rest wedged between the wing and taxiway surface.  The airplane sustained substantial damage.  The string of carts came from the direction of the concourse D gates 10 through 14.  The baggage carts were equipped with a manual towbar actuated front two-wheel brake system.  The parking brake is designed to activate by the operator raising the towbar to the vertical position.  To release the parking brake, the brake/towbar-latch is pushed down by foot while the top of the tow bar is pushed inward toward the cart until the brake/towbar-latch is unhooked.  Northwest Airlines, the owner of runaway carts, issued an employee memorandum after the accident reiterating the importance of ensuring that the braking system is engaged when leaving carts unattended.

Armavia flight 967 departed Yerevan (EVN) at 00:47 on a scheduled flight to Sochi (AER). Weather at Sochi was poor with rain and poor visibility. Radio contact with Sochi was established at 01:10. The flight crew discussed the current weather conditions at Sochi with the approach controller. At 01:26 the crew decided to return to Yerevan due to the below minima weather conditions at Sochi. At 01:30 the crew again requested the latest weather information. Visibility now was reported as 3600 m with a cloud base at 170 m. The captain now decided to continue to Sochi instead. Clearance was give to descent to an altitude of 3600 m. At 02:00 further descent instructions for 1800 m were issued by the air traffic controller. Weather conditions for an approach to runway 06 were now equal to the airport minima. Sochi Tower then cleared the flight to descend to 600 m. The glideslope was captured and the gear was lowered at 02:10. The crew reported ready and where cleared for landing. Weather was reported as 4000 m visibility with a cloud base at 190 m. Weather deteriorated quickly and thirty seconds later the controller reported that the cloud base was now at 100 m. He instructed the flight to abort the approach and told the crew to make a climbing right hand turn to an altitude of 600 m. The aircraft was flying at 300 m and performed a climbing turn to 450 m. Simultaneously the groundspeed dropped and the Airbus descended until it contacted the water and broke up. Wreckage sank to a depth of 700 m. CONCLUSION: ""The fatal crash of the Armavia A-320 EK-32009 was a CFIT accident that happened due to collision with the water while carrying-out a climbing manoeuvre after an aborted approach to Sochi airport at night with weather conditions below the established minima for runway 06. While performing the climb with the autopilot disengaged, the Captain, being in a psychoemotional stress condition, made nose down control inputs due to the loss of pitch and roll awareness. This started the abnormal situation. Subsequently the Captain's inputs in the pitch channel were insufficient to prevent development of the abnormal situation into the catastrophic one. Along with the inadequate control inputs of the Captain, the contributing factors to development of the abnormal situation into the catastrophic one were also the lack of necessary monitoring of the aircraft descent parameters (pitch attitude, altitude, vertical speed) by the co-pilot and the absence of proper reaction by the crew to the EGPWS warning.METAR: 22:00 UTC / 02:00 local time: URSS 022200Z VRB01MPS 4000 -SHRA BR BKN006 OVC027CB 11/11 Q1018 TEMRO 1500 BR VV005 RMK G/~Z QFE762 SC05=wind variable at 1m/sec, visibility 4000m, light rain showers, mist 5-7 oktas cloud at 600ft, 8 oktas overcast cloud at 2700ft with thunder clouds, temperature 11C dewpoint 11C, QNH 1018hPa, visibility 1500m mist vertical visibility 500ftAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: - Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   Gazeta.ru  MAK Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC)  Ministry of Emergency Situations (MChS) of Russia History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  1 May 2005 EK32009 Armavia 0 Moskva-Vnukovo Airport (VKO) min Runway excursion Location  Images: photo (c) Avianet.de (Ralf Hoffmann); Amsterdam-Schiphol Airport (AMS); 16 October 2005 photo (c) Ger Buskermolen; Amsterdam-Schiphol Airport (AMS); 22 May 2005 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates18-Feb-2025 08:31 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Six minutes later, the crew declared an emergency due to a fire in the number 2 engine. The no. 2 engine quit and the crew tried to extinguish the fire by activating the fire bottles. This did not extinguish the fire. They feathered the no. 2 propeller and simultaneously the no. 1 propeller feathered. The crew decided to perform an off-field forced landing, but then the engine fire extinguished. They made it back to Norman Wells where an emergency landing on two engines was carried out. The aircraft departed the runway and came to a halt in deep snow some 60 feet from the edge of the runway. Findings as to Causes and Contributing Factors: 1. Airworthiness Directive AD 48-12-01 mandates the replacement of the potentially hazardous fuel line, but the line had not been replaced on this aircraft. 2. A fuel leak from the main fuel inlet line in the engine compartment of this cargo DC-4 caused an in-flight fire that spread into the nacelle and wing. 3. The fuel-fed fire burned for an extended period of time because turning the fuel selector off is not required as part of the primary Engine Fire Checklist.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: TSB Report A06W0002 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: CADORS Number: 2006C0041   Location  Images: photo (c) Peter Taylor, via Anson Chappell; Norman Wells Airport, NT (YVQ); 06 January 2001; (CC:by-nc-nd) photo (c) Peter Taylor, via Anson Chappell; Norman Wells Airport, NT (YVQ); 06 January 2001; (CC:by-nc-nd) photo (c) Peter Taylor, via Anson Chappell; Norman Wells Airport, NT (YVQ); 06 January 2001; (CC:by-nc-nd) photo (c) Peter Taylor, via Anson Chappell; Norman Wells Airport, NT (YVQ); 06 January 2001; (CC:by-nc-nd) photo (c) Dirk Septer; Hay River Airport, NT (YHY/CYHY); 16 July 2009 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The car collided with the right wing of the aircraft, which was stopped at the H1 holding point of runway 30. In the preceding minutes, an Alitalia aircraft, with call sign AZ085, had taken off for Milan. After takeoff, IB1343 was cleared to enter runway 30 and ANS8831 was cleared to taxi to the H1 holding point vacated by IB1343.  The Alitalia aircraft radioed, two minutes before the accident, to report a possible loss of an object during takeoff, advising a runway check. The controller called the signalman for an check of runway 12/30. The signalman moved with the car from the base house, along taxiway A to H1 to access the runway from there, and the accident occurred at this waiting point.  Causes It is considered that the collision of the signaling service vehicle with the EC-JEN aircraft, which was stopped at the H1 holding point, occurred because the signaller was not aware of the presence of the aircraft. The signaling car had been authorized by the Valencia Airport aerodrome control service to access the H1 holding point without having been informed of the presence of the EC-JEN aircraft, which in turn had been authorized to taxi to the same point minutes earlier. Possible influencing factors in the accident are considered to be: - Glare effect exerted by the road running to the left and converging with taxiway A when, in night light conditions, taxiing from the north apron to standby point H1. - Aircraft logo lights off, limiting visibility to the rear, especially in areas close to the runway. - Incorrect execution of runway inspection procedures. - Excessive speed of the signaling vehicle in the movement area. - Movement of the signaling vehicle along the edge of the taxiway. - Decreased visibility of the accident area from the control tower due to light conditions and the presence of trees. - Decreased attention in both controller and signalman due to: * A low workload environment, with perceived absence of threats and no demanding demands due to the high degree of experience on the job, and. * Work shifts that disrupt daytime cycles of activity.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIAIAC Report number: A-002/2006 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: CIAIAC Ref.

Airline station personnel had received authorization to call contract maintenance to investigate the oil leak from one of the airline's senior maintenance controllers.  As a result, three mechanics from a fixed base operator (FBO) at the airport were called by the airline station personnel.  The FBO had previously entered into an agreement with the airline to provide contract maintenance at the airport.   All of the airline's maintenance manuals were maintained at the airline's headquarters maintenance control base.  According to the airline's procedures, extracts of those manuals with specific procedures were required to be transmitted prior to the contractor performing maintenance, and only after authorization by the airline's maintenance control.   After becoming concerned about the delay in hearing back regarding the investigation into the engine leak, a senior maintenance controller for the airline attempted to contact airline station personnel, and the FBO, several times to determine what instructions and authorizations would be needed.  The investigation revealed that the FBO did not make contact with the airline to obtain the requested maintenance approval and required documentation to work on the engine.     Meanwhile, both sides of the engine fan cowl panels were opened by the mechanics to conduct the engine inspection and check for leaks.  The mechanics made a request to the captain (via ground-to-cockpit intercom system) for an engine run to check for the leak source.  One mechanic positioned himself on the inboard side of the right engine and the other mechanic on the outboard side of the engine.  The third mechanic was positioned clear of the engine because he was assigned to observe the procedure as part of his on-the-job training.   The engine was started and stabilized at idle RPM for approximately 3 minutes while the initial leak check was performed by the two journeymen mechanics that were working around the engine.  One of these two mechanics then called the captain on the ground intercom system and reported that a small oil leak was detected, and he requested that the captain run the engine at 70 percent power for 2 minutes to conduct further checks.  The captain complied with the request, after verifying with the mechanic that the area around the airplane was clear.   Witnesses on the ground and in the airplane stated that they saw the mechanic on the outboard side of the engine stand up, step into the inlet hazard zone, and become ingested into the intake of the engine.  This occurred about 90 seconds into the 70-percent-power engine run.  The mechanic was not wearing any type of safety equipment or lanyard to prevent the ingestion.  Upon sensing a buffet, the captain immediately retarded the power lever back to the idle position.  The first officer stated to the captain that something went into the engine and the captain immediately cut off the start lever to stop the engine run.   The mechanic who was fatally injured was hired by the FBO in November 1997, and had been a certified mechanic for 40 years.   He received maintenance training from the airline regarding on-call maintenance procedures in March 2004, nearly two years prior to the accident.  The airline provided training to contract maintenance stations in the form of classroom instruction, interactive computer based scenarios, and training videos.  Specific training (either initial or recurrent) regarding ground engine runs and associated hazards was not provided to the contract mechanics by the airline. According to the surviving contract mechanic that worked around the engine with the fatally injured mechanic, maintenance instructions were not needed for the engine run because engine oil leaks were a common occurrence, and because of his past experience as a mechanic. Under the section entitled ""Engine Run Rules - General"" i Probable Cause: the mechanic's failure to maintain proper clearance with the engine intake during a jet engine run, and the failure of contract maintenance personnel to follow written procedures and directives contained in the airline's general maintenance manual.  Factors contributing to the accident were the insufficient training provided to the contract mechanics by the airline, and the failure of the airport to disseminate a policy prohibiting ground engine runs above idle power in the terminal area.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DFW06FA056 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: NTSB: https://www.ntsb.gov/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/brief.aspx?ev_id=20060131X00140&key=1  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates30-Apr-2014 07:03 Katonk2014 Added 03-May-2014 10:29 Katonk2014 Updated [Total fatalities, ]21-Dec-2016 19:28 ASN Update Bot Updated [Time, Damage, Category, Investigating agency, ]05-Dec-2017 09:00 ASN Update Bot Updated [Cn, Operator, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, ]28-Aug-2024 16:11 Anon.

On board the aircraft were two Mozambican pilots, accompanied by two paramedics, an elderly male patient with a fractured hip secured to a stretcher and the patient's wife. The pilot-in-command who was also the pilot flying stated that after an uneventful flight, he executed a normal landing on Runway 06L at Lanseria International Aerodrome. He then selected reverse thrust on both engines but during the landing roll, the pilot not flying notified him that the left-hand main landing gear, down and locked light went out and the red landing gear unsafe warning light had illuminated. Shortly thereafter the left-hand wing started to drop and whilst the pilot attempted to maintain directional control, he requested the non flying pilot to shut down the engines. The aircraft veered off the runway onto the grass area next to the runway before coming to rest on the grass area. The pilots, passenger, paramedics and patient sustained no injuries during the accident however the aircraft sustained damage to the left-hand main landing gear, left-hand engine, left-hand propeller, left-hand landing gear doors and left-hand outboard and inboard flaps. The last Phase Inspection prior to the accident was certified on 27 March 2005 at 21152 airframe hours. At the time of the accident the aircraft had accumulated a further 186 airframe hours since the last phase inspection was certified. Probable Cause The left-hand undercarriage support arm draglink upper attachment bolt failed during the landing and the pilot was unable to maintain directional control of the aircraft.

The aircraft did not make it and crashed in the woods, some 10 km from the airport. CONCLUSIONS FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1. The engine lost power when a compressor turbine blade failed as a result of the overstress extension of a fatigue-generated crack. The fracture initiated at a metallurgical anomaly in the parent blade material and progressed, eventually resulting in blade failure due to overstress rupture. 2. The combination of aircraft position at the time of the engine failure, the lack of equipment enabling the pilot to locate and identify high terrain, and the resultant manoeuvring required to avoid entering instrument flight conditions likely prevented the pilot from attempting to glide to the nearest airfield. FINDINGS AS TO RISK: 1. Single-engine instrument flight rules (SEIFR) operations in designated mountainous regions have unique obstacle risks in the event of an engine failure. Canadian equipment requirements for such operations do not currently include independent terrain mapping, such as terrain awareness and warning systems (TAWS). 2. Airline operators are not currently required to conduct any additional route evaluation or structuring to ensure that the risk of an off-field landing is minimized during SEIFR operations. 3. Pilots involved in commercial SEIFR operations do not receive training in how to conduct a forced landing under instrument flight conditions; such training would likely improve a pilot's ability to respond to an engine failure when operating in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC). 4. Mean time between failure (MTBF) calculations do not take into account In Flight Shut Downs (IFSDs) not directly attributable to the engine itself; it may be more appropriate to monitor all IFSD events. 5. The design of the Cessna 208B Caravan fuel shutoff valves increases the risk that the valves will open on impact, allowing fuel spillage and increasing the potential for fire.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: TSB Report A06P001 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: CADORS Number: 2006P0080   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane climbed to its assigned cruising altitude of FL380, which was reached at about 06:06 MST. The descend for Carlsbad was started an hour later, at 06:06 PST. Air traffic control cleared the flightcrew for the ILS approach to runway 24, which was 4,897 feet long. The flightcrew then reported that they had the runway in sight, cancelled their IFR clearance, and executed a VFR approach in VFR conditions to the airport. The reported winds favoured a landing toward the east, onto the opposite runway (runway 6). During the approach, after a query from the first officer, the captain indicated to the first officer that he was going to ""...land to the east,"" consistent with the reported winds. However, the final approach and subsequent landing were made to runway 24, which produced a six-knot tailwind. During the approach sequence the captain maintained an airspeed that was approximately 30 knots higher than the correct airspeed for the aircraft's weight, resulting in the aircraft touching down about 1,500 feet further down the runway than normal, and much faster than normal. The captain then delayed the initiation of a go-around until the first officer asked if they were going around. Although the aircraft lifted off the runway surface prior to departing the paved overrun during the delayed go-around it impacted a localizer antenna platform, whose highest non-frangible structure was located approximately 304 feet past the end of the runway, and approximately two feet lower than the terrain at the departure end of the runway. The aircraft continued airborne as it flew over downsloping terrain for about 400 more feet before colliding with the terrain and a commercial storage building that was located at an elevation approximately 80 feet lower than the terrain at the end of the runway. The localizer antenna platform was located outside of the designated runway safety area, and met all applicable FAA siting requirements. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The captain's delayed decision to execute a balked landing (go-around) during the landing roll. Factors contributing to the accident include the captain's improper decision to land with a tailwind, his excessive airspeed on final approach, and his failure to attain a proper touchdown point during landing.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: SEA06MA047 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; GenÃ¨ve-Cointrin Airport (GVA/LSGG); June 1999 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

At Burnsville performed a ""touch-and-go."" Following the touch-and-go, at about 11:45, and upon raising the landing gear, they got an ""unsafe gear"" light. The crew cycled the gear back down and got a ""three green"" normal indication. They cycled the gear back up and again got the ""gear unsafe"" light. They cycled the gear three more times with the same results. The crew decided to return to Asheville, and upon extending the gear for a visual landing at Asheville, the right main landing gear green light did not illuminate. The crew stated that they performed all of the checklist procedures and asked the control tower personnel to visually look to see if the gear was down and that tower personnel reported that it was. The crew asked the tower personnel if the landing light was on, and tower personnel replied that is was not. According to the flight crew, they went through the emergency procedures again, but they had no luck in getting the landing gear to lock down. They said that there was no landing light and that they got the gear horn with the gear down and full flaps with the throttles at idle. The crew stated they were sure that the gear was out of the uplocks but not down and locked. The crew stated that, after talking with maintenance personnel on the ground at Asheville, they decided to divert to Greensboro/High Point-Piedmont Triad International Airport, NC (GSO), where there were better facilities to handle the situation. One of the passengers had noticed that after the crew had recycled the gear the last time, a panel on the right wing was pushed up. The flight continued to Greensboro, at 150 knots with the gear down. Greensboro tower personnel cleared the flight for a visual approach. According to the crew, the landing was normal for the first 2,000 feet of roll out, then the right main landing gear collapsed. The crew said that, when the gear collapsed, they shut down both engines and the airplane veered off the right side of the runway into the grass. Both crewmembers and passengers exited the airplane through the main door with no injuries.

Flights were planned to verify the fuel flow rates for those tanks. Prior to departure, both flight crews decided that they would join-up after departure in order to take video and still photography of each airplane. N3735W and N372AC departed Milwaukee (MKE) at 15:55 and 16:15, respectively. After departure and clearing MKE airspace, the flight crew of N372AC established radio and visual contact with N3735W. N3735W then proceeded to perform several fly-bys past N372AC who remained on constant headings and altitude. N3735W then came up along the other Shorts' left side and flew in formation with approximately 100-150 feet lateral separation. A pilot of N3735W then announced over the radio that they would turn right and descend below N372AC. During that manoeuver N3735W's left wing impacted the left wing and engine of the other plane. The captain of N372AC attempted to climb in an attempt to avoid impacting N3735W. The outboard 3/4 of the left wing of N3735W separated and the airplane crashed out of control, into a field southeast of the intersection of Highway Q and Highway 19 and caught fire. After the collision, N372AC rolled to the left and pitched down significantly before the flight crew regained control of the airplane. The flight crew declared an emergency and diverted to Juneau-Dodge County Airport, WI (UNU) for an emergency landing. N372AC experienced a complete hydraulic failure and was losing hydraulic fluid. The flight crew performed an emergency landing on runway 08 (5,069 feet by 100 feet, asphalt) with flaps retracted and a partially extended landing gear.

Flights were planned to verify the fuel flow rates for those tanks. Prior to departure, both flight crews decided that they would join-up after departure in order to take video and still photography of each airplane. N3735W and N372AC departed Milwaukee (MKE) at 15:55 and 16:15, respectively. After departure and clearing MKE airspace, the flight crew of N372AC established radio and visual contact with N3735W. N3735W then proceeded to perform several fly-bys past N372AC who remained on constant headings and altitude. N3735W then came up along the other Shorts' left side and flew in formation with approximately 100-150 feet lateral separation. A pilot of N3735W then announced over the radio that they would turn right and descend below N372AC. During that manoeuver N3735W's left wing impacted the left wing and engine of the other plane. The captain of N372AC attempted to climb in an attempt to avoid impacting N3735W. The outboard 3/4 of the left wing of N372AC separated and the airplane crashed out of control, into a field southeast of the intersection of Highway Q and Highway 19 and caught fire. After the collision, N372AC rolled to the left and pitched down significantly before the flight crew regained control of the airplane. The flight crew declared an emergency and diverted to Juneau-Dodge County Airport, WI (UNU) for an emergency landing. N372AC experienced a complete hydraulic failure and was losing hydraulic fluid. The flight crew performed an emergency landing on runway 08 (5,069 feet by 100 feet, asphalt) with flaps retracted and a partially extended landing gear. The airplane overran the end of the runway, coming to rest about 100 feet from the departure threshold.

The pilot said overhauled brake assemblies had been installed before the accident.  He complained that the brakes felt ""spongy"" and the pedals went ""almost to the floor, requiring two or three additional pumps for a hard pedal.""  He was told that this was ""normal"" since the airplane was not equipped with power brakes or anti-skid.  The brakes were removed and sent to the overhaul facility.  They found that both brake assemblies each had one return mechanism binding.  The return mechanism had a self adjusting friction bushing meant to slip along the return pin at a predetermined spring pressure.  As pressure was applied to the brake, the pressure plate extended toward the number one rotor, pulling the return pins through the swage and tube assemblies and compressing the return springs.  Although the swage should move through the tube, one swage on each brake was not moving freely.  The brake travel went further than normal because ""normal travel"" was never set. Probable Cause: mechanical binding of the normal brake system, rendering directional control impossible.  Contributing factors were the improper overhaul, inadequate quality control procedures by the overhaul facility, and the rough terrain.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: MIA06LA052 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: NTSB MIA06LA052 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates09-Oct-2022 07:08 ASN Update Bot Added 17-Nov-2022 00:01 Ron Averes Updated [Aircraft type, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The airplane again ""swerved"" to the right.  He then applied the emergency brake.  The airplane departed the right side of the runway and struck the concrete pad of a runway marker sign. An FAA inspector reported finding hydraulic fluid covering the left main landing gear.  He said the main and auxiliary left brake lines were both fractured, and the right main landing gear tire was ""shredded off the wheel.""  According to NTSB's Materials Laboratory Factual Report, the brake line transmits hydraulic fluid and the auxiliary brake line transmits compressed nitrogen.  Both brake line fractures were the result of fatigue cracking.  No mechanical or other damage was evident on the exterior of the line in the initiation area. Maintenance records dating back to the airplane's date of manufacture revealed the brake lines had never been removed or replaced. Probable Cause: Failure of both the left main and auxiliary brake lines due to fatigue cracking, rendering directional control impossible.

The member of ground staff whose responsibility it was to ensure that the stand was unobstructed, was unable to see the whole stand from his assigned position in the jetty. Members of ground staff who saw the potential conflict were unable to alert the pilots. Three safety recommendations were made. Conclusion The right wingtip of the aircraft struck a van which was parked in an area of the stand which should have been free from all obstructions. The driver of the van was aware that he should not park there and had intended to move to a different position prior to the arrival of the aircraft. Congestion in the baggage handling area of the stand prevented him from doing so. The pilots were aware that the van was parked incorrectly but elected to continue onto the stand, believing that it would not be an obstacle. This would have been the case if the aircraft had been lined up on the stand centreline before entering the stand. However, the commander, aware of the confined nature of the stand, made a tighter turn onto the stand than that indicated by the lead-in line painted on the ground and remained at all times to the right of the stand centreline.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: EW/C2006/02/02 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5422f94340f0b613420006a9/Boeing_737-45D__SP-LLB_01-07.pdf  https://www.jetphotos.com/photo/435550 (Photo) History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  26 May 2011 SP-LLB LOT Polskie Linie Lotnicze 0 Brussel-Zaventem Airport (BRU/EBBR) sub Gear collapse 29 December 2019 N803TJ Swift Air 0 NW of San Jose , CA min Engine failure Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates03-Feb-2025 07:10 Justanormalperson Added 03-Feb-2025 07:13 ASN Updated [Narrative, Accident report, ] Corrections or additions? ...

When the pilots, after several tries, did not manage to get normal function of the landing gear they requested to go back and land at the departure airport. During the return flight the pilots requested to make a low fly-by over the airport to try to get the position of the landing gear checked from the ground by airport personnel. This was accepted and the aircraft made an ILS approach 1 to runway 03 and levelled out at 200â300 above ground level. The low pass was made parallel to runway 03 and approximately halfway between the runway and the control tower. After the fly-by, during which the pilots heard that staff on the ground thought that all the landing gear was lowered, they decided to land on runway 03. A smooth landing was achieved on the main gear at about 100 knots IAS and with the nose wheel in the air. The nose wheel remained extended for about 2.5 seconds after its first contact with the ground, and then the nose wheel gear folded forwards towards its retracted state. The nose of the aircraft hit the runway and the aircraft slid further, supported by its nose and the main landing gear for about 300 meters before it stopped. No one onboard was injured and the evacuation was made via slides.  During the evacuation one of the cabin crew, a female, had difficulties to lock the rear left door in full open position which made the evacuation difficult. The technical investigation has showed that a grease-nipple on the nose wheel locking mechanism was blocked resulting in insufficient lubrication causing the mechanism to jam. Furthermore the Board has noted that the certification requirements for emergency evacuation from an inclined aircraft do not contain a requirement for the door to be capable of being secured in the open position. The accident was caused by seizure of the nose wheel locking mechanism as a result of a blocked grease nipple, which prevented correct lubrication.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: SHK Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SHK Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates14-Dec-2024 15:34 ASN Added Corrections or additions? ...

The operator reported that after the airplane's engines had been started, it was discovered that a baby stroller had not been off-loaded.  The station agents notified the captain, who shut down the left engine.  An agent accessed the cargo compartment, located at the left, rear portion of the airplane.  While he was exiting the compartment, the station agent lost his balance and dropped the stroller onto the ramp.  The stroller landed on its wheels and was blown under the fuselage by the wind and into the right main landing gear.  The stroller was subsequently blown forward into the right propeller arc, where the operating propeller struck it.  Fragments from the stroller impacted the airplane's fuselage, puncturing three holes and causing several dents in the pressurized fuselage.  The wind speed was about 20 knots, gusting to 31 knots, at the time of the accident. Probable Cause: The station agent's inability to maintain control of the stroller when he lost his balance exiting the airplane's cargo compartment, allowing it to be blown into the operating right propeller.  A factor was the high, gusty winds.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CHI06LA092 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB CHI06LA092 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  24 March 2016 VP-CKI Cayman Airways Express 0 Grand Cayman Island-Owen Roberts International Airport (GCM/MWCR) min Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates09-Oct-2022 06:15 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

One flight attendant located in the aft galley sustained serious injuries.  The passengers and remaining crew were not injured.  The aircraft was not damaged.  The captain reported that the airplane was established in cruise at FL390 with smooth air conditions.  She stated that the turbulence encounter began with a ""slight buffet"" and ""rapidly increasing"" airspeed.  She attempted to maintain cruise airspeed by decreasing engine power and climbing to a higher altitude.  She noted that as she initiated the climb, the aircraft experienced moderate turbulence.  She reported that as the airplane reached FL400, the airspeed began a ""rapid decrease"" and she initiated a descent back to FL390.  The flight subsequently descended to FL350 before the conditions smoothed out.  She noted that the turbulence was encountered ""suddenly and without warning.""  The flight data recorder indicated that the airspeed increased from 236 knots to 273 knots during the encounter.  A vertical acceleration spike of 1.81 g's, followed by 0.61 g's, was recorded 64 seconds after the initial increase in airspeed. The weather forecast provided to the crew listed a risk of moderate turbulence between 20,000  and 38,000 feet. While ATC communications were describing light turbulence and moderate chop at lower altitudes, no reports from ATC, company dispatch, or other aircraft were received regarding mountain wave activity or turbulence at 39,000 feet. Probable Cause: An inadvertent encounter with unforecast mountain wave turbulence during cruise flight.  A contributing factor was the mountain wave (terrain induced) turbulence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CHI06LA099 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB CHI06LA099  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates25-Mar-2024 09:10 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

The aircraft was cleared for the VOR B approach to Butte at 14:48. A weather front had been approaching the area from the south to the north/northeast. Weather conditions included icing conditions followed by heavy snow fall with poor visibility and variable winds in the mountains.  According to the approach plate, the transition to the approach is via a DME arc at 9,000 feet with no procedure turn. The flight is to track inbound on the 127 degree radial, descending down to, but no lower than, 7,700 feet to the initial approach fix (IAF). After crossing the IAF, the flight is to turn to 097 degrees for 10 nautical miles and descend to 6,900 feet. The remainder of the 1.5 nautical miles to the runway is to be flown under visual conditions.  During the descent the airplane collided with trees and subsequently the mountainous terrain on a heading of approximately 127 degrees and about 6,900 feet mean sea level. The initial impact point was located approximately nine nautical miles on a magnetic bearing of 130 degrees from the IAF. Documentation of the horizontal situation indicator (HSI) on the left side instrument panel indicated that the course arrow was positioned to approximately 127 degrees, the inbound heading to the IAF. The co-pilot (right side) course arrow was positioned to 115 degrees. The location of the wreckage and the 127 degree heading on the HSI indicate that the pilots failed to follow the approach procedure and turn to a heading of 097 degrees after crossing the IAF.

The weather in Seville at the time of arrival was forecast to be stormy with variable rain and winds. The visibility, reduced by the heavy rain, was in excess of 2,000 m (RVR) at the runway 27 threshold. The runway in use at Seville was runway 27, which had CAT I visual and precision radio navigation landing aids. While in autopilot, the aircraft captured the ILS localizer as it neared Seville, at a distance of 11 NM from the runway 27 threshold. Flight 2652 was cleared to land on runway 27 some nine minutes prior to its arrival time and before descending below the transition level, which was at 7,500 ft above sea level. The control tower reported the wind about three minutes prior to landing, which at that time was from 240Â° at 15 kt. The runway was wet and it was raining heavily. The crew was told to proceed on course to Seville at their discretion and in accordance with their procedures. With the tower's clearance, they captured the glideslope early, far above the 2,000 ft specified in the published AIP procedure and descended along the ILS glideslope without significant deviations from the localize and glidepath until they were below 1,000 ft AGL and with the runway in sight. Established on the glideslope with the gear down and flaps 30Â°, they disengaged the autopilot at about 700 ft and shortly thereafter they started to climb above the glideslope. The aircraft then descended to the runway at very high descent rates. The EGPWS SINK RATE and PULL-UP warnings sounded shortly before touchdown. The airplane landed in the middle of an intense rain storm. Personnel in the control tower saw a flame or glow on the right side of the aircraft. During the hard impact with the runway at the aiming point, some 300 m beyond the threshold, the right main gear leg collapsed, pivoting backwards and partially detaching. The crew was able to maintain steering control of the aircraft, which came to a stop after a 900-m landing run. Full reverse thrusters were used to decelerate the airplane. The entire landing roll took place on the paved runway surface. Only at the end of the run did part of the airplane, the right wingtip, touch the ground in an area beyond the paved asphalt. After coming to a stop, and lacking the support from the right leg, the aircraft was being held up by its left leg and right engine, which is forward of the airplane's center of gravity, as a result of which the aircraft tilted backwards until the tail touched the ground during the final seconds of braking. There was no fuel leak and no fire. The captain gave the evacuation order, which was carried out using the four doors on both sides of the airplane. Due to the final nose-up pitch of the aircraft, the front doors were at a significant height above the ground. As a result, the emergency evacuation ramps were inclined at an excessive angle that hindered the exit of the airplane's occupants. Causes: ""The accident was caused by a very hard landing of the aircraft, during which the right main landing gear was broken, as a consequence of a non stabilized approach. The aircraft became unstabilized during the approach, which was conducted under stormy weather conditions with heavy rains and lightning, and the crew did not adhere to the applicable standard procedures.""METAR: 09:00 UTC / 10:00 local time: LEZL 180900Z 17011G22KT 3000 TSRA FEW015CB BKN020 15/15 Q1001 NOSIG=09:30 UTC / 10:30 local time: LEZL 180930Z 24011G22KT 3000 +TSRA SCT008 FEW015CB BKN020 14/14 Q1001 NOSIG=10:00 UTC / 11:00 local time: LEZL 181000Z 17005G16KT 140V240 3000 TSRA SCT008 FEW015CB BKN020 13/13 Q1001 NOSIG=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIAIAC Report number: A-011/2006 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 years and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: CIAIAC   Location  Images: photo (c) Jose MuÃ±oz; Sevilla Airport (SVQ); 19 March 2006 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

During the approach to runway 32R at Domodedovo Airport the airspeed was higher than recommended. The aircraft crossed the threshold at an altitude of 12 m and a speed of 304 km/h. During the flare, at an altitude of about 5 meters, the captain instructed the flight engineer to bring back the thrust levers to idle. The flight engineer confirmed selected all four engines to idle. The captain subsequently called for the thrust reversers to be deployed but the flight engineer did not confirm this instruction but asked again: ""Turn on the reverse?"".  The reverser buckets were then deployed, but the engines were not brought to the maximum reverse thrust. It is possible that at this moment the flight engineer was distracted. The aircraft floated at an altitude of 1-0.5 m over the runway. As a result, the landing of the aircraft occurred at a distance of 1100 m from the threshold end of the runway at a speed of 258 km/h. Before landing, the captain again instructed to turn on the reverse of the engines. A misunderstanding between the captain and flight engineer and subsequent actions by the flight engineer caused the two engines to be operated at full power with reversers stowed. The aircraft overran the end of the runway of runway 32R and continued for 680 meters before it collided with a slope of the ravine. The accident occurred as a result of erroneous actions by the flight engineer during operations to turn on the engine reverse when landing the plane, expressed in shifting the reverse buckets to direct thrust and putting the 1st and 4th engines to take-off mode after landing. The Commission concluded that the flight engineerÂs erroneous actions were facilitated by: - a low level of technological discipline in the crew due to the weak role of the captain as a leader in the crew, which was manifested in the crew members not fully fulfilling the ""Instructions for the interaction and technology of the crew members of the IL-62M aircraft"" and Aircraft Flight Manual during descent, approach and landing; - emotional relaxation of the crew at the end of a business trip and return to base; - lack of effective control, including according to the data of flight recorders over flight operations with LIBAVIA; - in the ""Instructions for the interaction and technology of the crew of the IL-62M aircraft"" there are no control functions on the part of other crew members for the actions of the flight engineer at the stage of aircraft landing and the status of the reverse  on/off alarm; - the absence in the training programs of the simulator of exercises for practicing the actions of crew members in case of erroneous actions by the flight engineer when the reverse is turned on; - lack of equipment for the flight engineerÂs workplace with a radio headset, lack of procedures in the ""Instructions for Interaction and the Work Technology of the Crew Members of the Il-62M Aircraft"" for the use of a radio headset for flight personnel in flights with a reduced crew; - excessive volume of the SSU speakers broadcasting external radio communications, which created additional difficulties when listening to the commands given by the captain; - fuzziness (illegibility) of the commands given by the PIC and the lack of response of the PIC to the non-confirmation of the commands given by him to the flight engineer.METAR: 16:30 UTC / 20:30 local time: UUDD 291630Z 17002MPS 2400 -RA BR BKN004 OVC100 03/02 Q1002 TEMPO 0500 FG =17:00 UTC / 21:00 local time: UUDD 291700Z 19002MPS 160V230 1800 -RA BR BKN004 OVC10003/02 Q1002 EMPO 0500 FG = Sources: MAK Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC)  Russian Ministry of Transport   Location  Images: photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; ?; January 2001 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane was expected to arrive at 18:02. After takeoff the crew requested cancellation of their IFR flight plan ant to continue under visual flight rules at FL45. This was approved. Upon request, the flight was cleared to descend to 2000 feet to avoid an area of poor weather. About 17:39 a left turn was initiated towards the coast line for the same reason. The airplane struck trees near the top of Pico da Pedra Bonita at an elevation of 1920 feet. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS (translated from Portuguese) 1. Human factors Psychological - Contributed It was found that the decision of the crew to cancel the IFR plan to continue VFR at low altitude and when visibility is not favorable, has been inadequate, with compliance of the pilots with such a decision. It is possible that the knowledge of the region obtained by the instructor captain caused over-confidence, influencing the decision. The organizational culture of the company proved to be complacent by not inhibiting the adoption of procedures incompatible with flight safety, such as the low altitude flights made by the instructor captain. Operational Aspect a. Judgement - Contributed There was inadequate assessment of the situation by the crew, causing them to fly at a lower altitude than the safe limits under visual conditions unsuitable for visual flight, resulting in the collision of the aircraft with high ground. b. Coordination Cabin - Contributed The use of human resources for the operation of the aircraft was unsuitable because of failure to comply with operational standards, leading the crew to perform a passenger flight to the lower altitude limits of safety, under inadequate visual conditions. c. Planning - Contributed The preparation for the flight proved inadequate because the crew did not have a meteorological analysis of the appropriate level of flight performed, considering that the conditions for the region were overshadowing the Serra do Mar and surrounding areas of low clouds and / or mist, especially on the slopes of the mountain. d. Adverse weather conditions - Contributors The weather conditions prevailing in the region made visual flight impossible, resulting in the concealment of the elevation at which the aircraft crashed. e. Flight indiscipline - Contributed The pilots intentionally not complying with rules of air traffic and civil aviation rules, without grounds, performing flight at low altitude, under conditions of visibility below the limits established for VFR flight, colliding with high ground. f Supervision - Contributed The company has not taken appropriate supervisory measures, enabling the existence of a culture of undeveloped flight safety, which prevented advance identification of actions taken by the crew and injured misconception exists in the CRM business, which represented a potential risk to their operations, as well as by the failure of some educational measures provided for in its PPAA (Plan for the Prevention of Aeronautical Accidents). 2 Material Factor Not contributed.

About ten minutes after takeoff the aircrew observed a No. 2 engine ""Thrust Reverser Not Locked"" indication light. They shut down the No. 2 engine as a precaution and decided to return to Dover. During the return the pilots and flight engineers continued to use the shut-down No. 2 engineÂs throttle while leaving the fully-operational No. 3 engine in idle. Also, the wrong flap setting was used. On final approach to runway 32, the airplane descended below the normal glidepath. The C-5 stalled , hit a utility pole and crashed into a field.

Fragments from the burst disk partially severed the LPT case and struck the fuselage in multiple locations. The airframe vibration increased to a severe level until the LPT rotor separated from the engine, about 14 minutes 30 seconds after the uncontained LPT stage 1 disk burst, when the high pressure turbine aft shaft and the fan mid shaft failed due to contact damage and torsional loading. Metallurgical examination of the portion of the LPT stage 1 disk that was imbedded in the right wing found that the disk burst due to a mixture of high cycle and low cycle fatigue. The fracture was located in the vicinity of the forward seal tooth serration, although the exact fracture origin could not be identified because the entire seal tooth and part of the seal tooth arm were missing at the fracture location. Examination of the forward seal tooth serration revealed the presence of two previous weld repairs that extended into the forward arm. Review of the manufacturing records revealed that the disk had been dabber weld repaired twice to correct anomalies and non-conformances found during the original manufacturing process. The dabber weld procedures did not authorize welding in the forward seal tooth serration, therefore, the weld repair performed on the failed LPT stage 1 disk did not conform to the approved repair instructions. Based on testing and analysis of sample, post-manufacture dabber weld repaired disks, the suspect population of CF6 disks was confined to those that had been repaired at original manufacture. Records indicated that, in addition to the accident disk, four other disks had been dabber weld repaired at original manufacture to correct forward seal tooth serration anomalies and non-conformances. None of these disks are any longer in service. Based on the estimated crack propagation rate, it is likely that either no crack existed at the last inspection of the disk or the crack size was below the reasonably detectable threshold. After the disk burst, the flight crew completed all required checklists; however, the crew could not manually shutdown the affected engine because the burst disk fragments had severed the fire shutoff valve cable, the power off cable, and the emergency shutoff cable. The engine eventually shutdown on its own due to airflow disruptions within the engine. The flight crewâs procedural coordination and use of available resources, consistent with cockpit resource management best practices, helped to ensure the safe landing of the airplane. Probable Cause: The rupture of a fatigue crack in the forward air seal tooth serration of the No. 3 engine low pressure turbine stage 1 disk that initiated due to an improper weld repair performed during original manufacture. The improper weld repair changed the material properties of the disk near the weld feature, resulting in an accelerated crack propagation rate that allowed the crack to grow to rupture before the next inspection interval. Contributing to the severity of the accident was the inability of the flight crew to shutdown the engine as a result of the damage caused by a liberated piece of the low pressure turbine stage 1 disk when it punctured the right wing.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA06FA033 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: NTSB: https://www.ntsb.gov/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/brief.aspx?ev_id=20060504X00511&key=1 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates03-May-2014 10:28 Katonk2014 Added 05-Dec-2017 10:12 ASN Update Bot Updated [Time, Cn, Operator, Other fatalities, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

Before the 12th takeoff the pilot allowed to two unauthorized persons to go on board, an 11-year old boy, who occupied a right seat, and a 22-year old man, who was standing behind the seats. Takeoff was performed at 14:51. During the left turn at a speed of 140-150 km/h the An-2 descended from altitude of 5-10 m, struck the ground, left lower wing first, crashed and was destroyed by fire. Both adult men were killed while the boy suffered the serious injures. MAIN CAUSE: Demonstrated self-sufficiency and lack of self-discipline by the aircraft commander, lead to violation of the flight rules during AW, defined in Aerial Works Instruction, due to which the complicated flight conditions became dangerous and in the specific circumstances the situation created developed to a catastrophic one. IMMEDIATE CAUSE: Collision with the terrain. The commission considered that for the occurrence contributed the following contributory factors: 1. Negligence of the requirements for available regular flying staff by Air Operator for the established by AOM flight conditions for minimum crew during AW. 2. Degraded level of control by Air Operator on the activities, character and quality of the aerial work performed. 3. Lack of in-depth analysis of the personal and professional abilities of the flight personnel of the Air Operator and passivity displayed in cases directly influencing the safe performing of the flights. During the process of the cause about the accident the commission disclosed also the following deficiencies: 1. Formal attitude of the inspector during the fulfillment of the control list of the aircraft commander for the flight proficiency and navigation check. 2. Lack of record in the aircraft engine technical book for installation of a plug No 105975 into the altitude corrector during the technical measures for PSSE. 3. The reason for replacement of the cylinder No 1, 4 and 9 wasnÂt registered in the technical documentation.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIU Bulgaria Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Ministry of Transport, Aircraft Accident Investigation Unit Accident Report  Translation: Dmitriy Yertsov   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

However, the aircraft bounced three times during the landing roll and the left-hand main undercarriage collapsed. Due to the friction caused by the collapsed left undercarriage, the aircraft began to veer to the left. It appeared as if the pilot was able to control the aircraft and recover to the right. However, the aircraft then veered to the left again and the left wing struck an embankment. The aircraft skidded for approximately 200 m before the left wing and left engine separated from the fuselage. The main fuselage structure collided with a water furrow and skidded for 40 m before coming to a rest in an inverted attitude. A post impact fire erupted, which destroyed the aircraft. All the occupants onboard the aircraft were fatally injured. The airplane carried telecom equipment on behalf of the Vodacom company.Sources: CAA S.A.

The airplane was traveling down a taxiway toward the active runway, and upon reaching an intersection, the captain noticed a loose string of baggage carts moving rapidly toward the airplane in an angled path from left to right.  He swerved the airplane to the right of the centerline in an effort to avoid collision with the baggage carts.  The lead rolling baggage cart struck the airplane's left wing, and the airplane traveled about 150 feet further down the taxiway before coming to a complete stop.  The lead baggage cart came to rest wedged between the wing and taxiway surface.  The airplane sustained substantial damage.  The string of carts came from the direction of the concourse D gates 10 through 14.  The baggage carts were equipped with a manual towbar actuated front two-wheel brake system.  The parking brake is designed to activate by the operator raising the towbar to the vertical position.  To release the parking brake, the brake/towbar-latch is pushed down by foot while the top of the tow bar is pushed inward toward the cart until the brake/towbar-latch is unhooked.  Northwest Airlines, the owner of runaway carts, issued an employee memorandum after the accident reiterating the importance of ensuring that the braking system is engaged when leaving carts unattended. Probable Cause: The failure of ground service personnel to properly set the parking brake on the lead baggage cart.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: LAX06LA154 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 12 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB LAX06LA154 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates08-Oct-2022 18:08 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

Armavia flight 967 departed Yerevan (EVN) at 00:47 on a scheduled flight to Sochi (AER). Weather at Sochi was poor with rain and poor visibility. Radio contact with Sochi was established at 01:10. The flight crew discussed the current weather conditions at Sochi with the approach controller. At 01:26 the crew decided to return to Yerevan due to the below minima weather conditions at Sochi. At 01:30 the crew again requested the latest weather information. Visibility now was reported as 3600 m with a cloud base at 170 m. The captain now decided to continue to Sochi instead. Clearance was give to descent to an altitude of 3600 m. At 02:00 further descent instructions for 1800 m were issued by the air traffic controller. Weather conditions for an approach to runway 06 were now equal to the airport minima. Sochi Tower then cleared the flight to descend to 600 m. The glideslope was captured and the gear was lowered at 02:10. The crew reported ready and where cleared for landing. Weather was reported as 4000 m visibility with a cloud base at 190 m. Weather deteriorated quickly and thirty seconds later the controller reported that the cloud base was now at 100 m. He instructed the flight to abort the approach and told the crew to make a climbing right hand turn to an altitude of 600 m. The aircraft was flying at 300 m and performed a climbing turn to 450 m. Simultaneously the groundspeed dropped and the Airbus descended until it contacted the water and broke up. Wreckage sank to a depth of 700 m. CONCLUSION: ""The fatal crash of the Armavia A-320 EK-32009 was a CFIT accident that happened due to collision with the water while carrying-out a climbing manoeuvre after an aborted approach to Sochi airport at night with weather conditions below the established minima for runway 06. While performing the climb with the autopilot disengaged, the Captain, being in a psychoemotional stress condition, made nose down control inputs due to the loss of pitch and roll awareness. This started the abnormal situation. Subsequently the Captain's inputs in the pitch channel were insufficient to prevent development of the abnormal situation into the catastrophic one. Along with the inadequate control inputs of the Captain, the contributing factors to development of the abnormal situation into the catastrophic one were also the lack of necessary monitoring of the aircraft descent parameters (pitch attitude, altitude, vertical speed) by the co-pilot and the absence of proper reaction by the crew to the EGPWS warning.METAR: 22:00 UTC / 02:00 local time: URSS 022200Z VRB01MPS 4000 -SHRA BR BKN006 OVC027CB 11/11 Q1018 TEMRO 1500 BR VV005 RMK G/~Z QFE762 SC05=wind variable at 1m/sec, visibility 4000m, light rain showers, mist 5-7 oktas cloud at 600ft, 8 oktas overcast cloud at 2700ft with thunder clouds, temperature 11C dewpoint 11C, QNH 1018hPa, visibility 1500m mist vertical visibility 500ftAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: - Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   Gazeta.ru  MAK Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC)  Ministry of Emergency Situations (MChS) of Russia History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  1 May 2005 EK32009 Armavia 0 Moskva-Vnukovo Airport (VKO) min Runway excursion Location  Images: photo (c) Avianet.de (Ralf Hoffmann); Amsterdam-Schiphol Airport (AMS); 16 October 2005 photo (c) Ger Buskermolen; Amsterdam-Schiphol Airport (AMS); 22 May 2005 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates18-Feb-2025 08:31 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The Adamair flight went missing during a domestic flight to Manado. Last contact was at 14:07 when the flight was enroute at FL350. Initial reports indicate that the flight changed course twice as a result of severe (130 km/h) crosswind. The airplane crashed into the sea. On January 11 part of a jetliner's tail, food trays and other debris was pulled from the sea. On January 25 a U.S. navy ship detected signals coming from the flight recorder. The FDR was recovered from a depth of on 2000 m August 27. The CVR was recovered on August 28 from a depth of 1900 m. Investigators found that, during the flight from Surabaya to Manado, the Inertial Reference System (IRS) malfunctioned. Both pilots became engrossed with trouble shooting the IRS anomalies for at least the last 13 minutes of the flight, with minimal regard to other flight requirements. The pilots selected Attitude in the IRS, which disengaged the autopilot. After the autopilot disengaged and the aircraft rolled right and exceeded 35 degrees right bank, the pilots appeared to have become spatially disoriented. Control was lost and the airplane broke up and crashed into the sea. CAUSES:  1) Flight crew coordination was less than effective. The PIC did not manage the task sharing; crew resource management practices were not followed. 2) The crew focused their attention on trouble shooting the Inertial Reference System (IRS) failure and neither pilot was flying the aircraft. 3) After the autopilot disengaged and the aircraft exceeded 30 degrees right bank, the pilots appeared to have become spatially disoriented. 4) The AdamAir syllabus of pilot training did not cover complete or partial IRS failure. 5) The pilots had not received training in aircraft upset recovery, including spatial disorientation. OTHER CAUSAL FACTORS: 1) At the time of the accident, AdamAir had not resolved the airworthiness problems with the IRS that had been reoccurring on their Boeing 737 fleet for more than 3 months. 2) The AdamAir maintenance engineering supervision and oversight was not effective and did not ensure that repetitive defects were rectified.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSC Report number: KNKT/07.01/08.01.36 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   Confusion over missing Indonesian airplane (Int.

At 19:48, air traffic control cleared TW350 out of controlled airspace via the Sandy Bay runway 05 non-directional beacon approach. The crew flew the approach straight-in to runway 05 and initiated a go-around from the landing flare. The aircraft did not maintain a positive rate of climb during the go-around and collided with trees just beyond the departure end of the runway. All four occupants survived the impact and evacuated the aircraft. The captain died of his injuries before rescuers arrived. Both emergency medical technicians were seriously injured, and the first officer received minor injuries. The aircraft sustained substantial damage from impact forces and was subsequently destroyed by a post-impact fire. FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1. The crew was unable to work effectively as a team to avoid, trap, or mitigate errors and safely manage the risks associated with flight TW350. 2. Transwest Air (TWA) managers had identified and addressed some crew pairing issues with respect to this crew, but were unaware of the degree to which these factors could impair their effective crew coordination. 3. The crew's lack of coordination was, in part, because they had not received recent crew resource management (CRM) training. 4. Contrary to company policy, the approach to Sandy Bay, Saskatchewan, was flown by the less experienced crew member. 5. The crew members did not assess the aircraft performance and did not identify runway length as a threat. Consequently, they did not discuss and agree on a point at which a safe landing was no longer possible and were unprepared to make and execute a timely go-around decision. 6. The first officer suggested a go-around at an appropriate time. However, inadequate preparation and coordination by the crew members resulted in the captain rejecting this suggestion and they continued the approach past the point at which the aircraft could be safely stopped on the runway. 7. The captain decided to initiate a go-around, but his communication of this decision to the first officer was non-standard and did not have the desired effect of triggering the correct sequence of go-around actions required. 8. The captain very likely took control of the aircraft from the first officer using the non-standard transfer of control practice the crew had developed, thereby causing confusion, which further eroded the limited opportunity to achieve a positive climb. 9. The discrepancy in the standard operating procedures (SOPs) describing the selection of flaps during go-around likely led to both pilots independently operating the flap control lever, distracting them from monitoring the climb performance during the go-around. 10. It is likely that a somatogravic illusion caused the pilot flying (PF) to lower the nose of the aircraft. Consequently, the aircraft did not maintain a positive rate of climb and collided with the trees. 11. Deficiencies in TWA's supervisory activities permitted the undetected development and persistence of substantial and widespread deviations from SOPs within the King Air operation. 12. The company management structure and workload, combined with the location of managers away from the remote bases of operations, reduced the effectiveness of operational control.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A07C0001 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Flight PE905 departed Grande Prairie (CYQU) at 10:40 MST on the first leg of a scheduled run to Fort St. John (CYXJ), Fort Nelson, BC, and Grande Prairie.  Air traffic control (ATC) cleared the flight to maintain 12 000 feet above sea level (asl), and to hold on the TAYLOR non directional beacon (NDB), which forms the final approach fix for the instrument landing system (ILS) approach to runway 29 at St. John. At 11:09, Flight PE905 was cleared for an ILS approach to runway 29. The first approach was discontinued due to the aircraft being too high on the final approach leg, and clearance was given to return to the TAYLOR NDB at 6000 feet. At 11:23, ATC cleared the flight for another ILS approach to runway 29. The second approach was conducted as a full procedure with the outbound leg extended to ensure that the aircraft was positioned to follow the correct vertical approach profile. The final approach course was flown with a flap setting of 20Âº and at the company standard operating procedure (SOP) recommended airspeed of 130 knots. At approximately 300 feet above ground level, the first officer informed the captain that he had the ground in sight. The approach lights were visual shortly thereafter. The captain discontinued his instrument scan and confirmed the appearance of the approach lights. The captain made the decision to land, and called for the full flap setting of 35Âº. The first officer diverted his attention to setting flaps, and to the Vref reference cards clipped to the instrument panel. When he looked up, the aircraft was almost on the ground, but short of the runway. There was insufficient time to warn the captain. The aircraft initially touched down in a nearly wings-level attitude, 320 feet short of the threshold in about 16 inches of packed snow. The left main gear contacted the surface first, followed by the right main gear, and then the nose wheel. The aircraft then struck the last set of approach lights, bounced slightly, and touched down again 180 feet short of the threshold. After sliding through the threshold lights, the aircraft came to rest on the right edge of the runway, 380 feet beyond the threshold. The right main gear had broken off, and the nose gear had collapsed rearward. Both propellers were damaged by ground contact. The aircraft was equipped with a belly-mounted cargo pod, which supported the fuselage during impact. FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1. A late full flap selection at 300 feet above ground level (agl) likely destabilized the aircraft's pitch attitude, descent rate and speed in the critical final stage of the precision approach, resulting in an increased descent rate before reaching the runway threshold. 2. After the approach lights were sighted at low altitude, both pilots discontinued monitoring of instruments including the glide slope indicator. A significant deviation below the optimum glide slope in low visibility went unnoticed by the crew until the aircraft descended into the approach lights. FINDING AS TO RISK: 1. The crew rounded the decision height (DH) figure for the instrument landing system (ILS) approach downward, and did not apply a cold temperature correction factor. The combined error could have resulted in a descent of 74 feet below the DH on an ILS approach to minimums, with a risk of undershoot. OTHER FINDING: 1. The cockpit voice recorder (CVR) was returned to service following an intelligibility test that indicated that the first officer's hot boom microphone intercom channel did not record. Although the first officer voice was recorded by other means, a potential existed for loss of information, which was key to the investigation.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: TSB Report A07W0005 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: TSB   Location  Images: photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Calgary International Airport, AB (YYC/CYYC); 19 July 1994 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft departed from Balikpapan at 23:00 UTC with a planned flight time of 55 minutes at an altitude of 7000 feet. There were 13 people on board; two pilots, a maintenance engineer, and 10 passengers. The pilot in command (PIC) was the pilot flying for the sector to Tanjung Bara, and the copilot was the monitoring pilot. The flight was normal until 5 minutes before landing when the number 1 (left engine) generator malfunctioned. The pilot in command (PIC) asked the maintenance engineer on board the aircraft, who advised that there was no problem for the aircraft operations. The aircraft made its final approach to runway 04 at Tanjung Bara at 23:50. The aircraft touched down to the right of the centreline, then diverged right into soft wet ground, impacting a channel embankment and subsequently a barbed-wire airport perimeter fence. The investigation determined that aircraft was not being flown on a stabilized approach and subsequently touched down to the right of the runway centerline. It then veered to the right of centerline after touchdown and the PICs effort to bring the aircraft back to the runway centreline by using aileron was ineffective. There was no evidence that visibility affecting visual acquisition of the runway was a factor. However, the investigation considered that a visual approach guidance system such as Visual Approach System Indication (VASI), may have provided additional visual cues to alert the pilots to the prevent the unstabilized approach. Causes: 1. The pilot in command (PIC) continued to land the aircraft from an unstabilized approach. 2. The PIC did not maintain effective and appropriate control of the aircraft on the ground.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSC Report number: KNKT/07.01.03.04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  26 January 2008 PK-VSE Dirgantara Air Services 3 6,3 km Se of Long Apung Airport (LPU) w/o CFIT Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airportâs ground service company was requested to send a special vehicle to embark passengers with reduced mobility. At 15:30, with some 30 passengers already aboard the aircraft, three female passengers were atop the vehicleâs front platform, along with the driver, who was responsible for raising and lowering the platform, and an assistant who was helping the passengers board the airplane. At that moment the frame that held the platform to the truck broke loose from its upper horizontal and lateral braces (Figure 1), leaving a gap between the platform and the aircraft through which the three passengers fell, resulting in serious injuries to two and slight injuries to the third. The operators were able to hold on to the side rails, and one of them was even able to briefly hold on to the passenger who ended up being slightly injured.

During the ground tests performed by the crew in Valladolid, the flaps extended and retracted normally, and so the captain decided to continue with the flights as scheduled. During the flight, the crew went over the abnormal procedures to be followed in case of a repeat failure of the flaps system. After taking off from Valladolid, the flaps were retracted normally and remained retracted during the cruise and descent phases until the initial approach to Barcelona, at which time they failed to extend to the 8-degree position when commanded, resulting in a ""flap fail"" warning on the EICAS (Engine Indication and Crew Alerting System). The copilot noted the discrepancy between the commanded 8Â° position on the flaps lever and the 0Â° indicated position. At that time they were below the clouds and under ATC radar control. In the zero-flaps configuration, the ILS approach speed, in accordance with the relevant procedure, had to be maintained above 180 kt. ATC cleared them for the runway 25R approach and informed of a moderate intensity crosswind of 14 kt from 320Â°. The aircraft descended until it touched down at an IAS of 172 kt, at which time the crew realized they had not lowered the landing gear. After a long slide on the runway, the aircraft stopped 240 m before the end of the runway. There was no fire, though high temperatures and kerosene leaks were detected. A firefighting vehicle that was on the tarmac immediately reported to the scene, and sprayed the part of the aircraft in contact with the ground with fire retardant foam. The aircraft, which was stranded in the middle of the runway, was evacuated using the two front doors 1L and 1R, and the 2R overwing exit. The emergency window on the left side was not opened. Two passengers were slightly bruised during the evacuation. The remaining occupants were not injured. CAUSES: ""It is considered that the omission to actuate the landing gear extension lever, before touchdown, was the direct cause of the accident. Consequently, a belly landing in a gear-up configuration followed. A contributing factor was the presence of certain technical anomalies in the operation of the flaps system which detracted from the attention of the crew.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIAIAC Report number: A-003/2007 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Hawaii Island Air, d.b.a. Island Air, was operating the airplane as a positioning flight under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 91.  The airline transport pilot licensed captain, first officer, one flight attendant, and two deadheading pilot crew members were not injured; one deadheading pilot sustained serious injuries.  The airplane was not damaged.  The cross-country repositioning flight departed Honolulu, Hawaii, about 1515, with a planned destination of Kahului, Hawaii.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan had been filed.  The approximate global positioning system (GPS) coordinates of the event were 21 degrees 09.02 minutes north latitude and 157 degrees 05.8 minutes west longitude.The airplane encountered severe turbulence during an en route descent and a captain who was deadheading was not secured in his seat and received serious injuries.  The airplane was being positioned to another airport, and had a deadheading flight crew on board.  Prior to the descent, the captain noted an airspeed anomaly for the existing power setting.  He also observed that the flap indicator showed a ""slight"" deployment of the flaps.  He requested that the deadheading captain look out a cabin window, and verify the flap position.  The deadheading captain reported to the flying captain that the flaps were in the fully retracted position.  About this time, ATC personnel requested that a descent be initiated, which the flight crew initiated by reducing the power to slow down the airplane.  As the deadheading captain was making his way back to his cabin seat, the airplane encountered severe turbulence, which lasted about 5 to 10 seconds.  He was thrown about the cabin and injured.  The flying captain declared an emergency.  The flight landed without incident, and taxied to the gate where the injured crewmember was transported to the hospital.  A review was conducted of the ATC air-ground recordings between Maui approach control (APCON), two other airplanes flying in the area, and the accident airplane (Moku 979).  Prior to Moku 979 checking in with Maui approach, the two other airplanes reported moderate turbulence at 4,000 feet, and moderate to occasional severe turbulence between 2,000 and 2,500 feet.  Both airplanes were about 15 miles east of Maui, in the general vicinity of the accident airplane.  The controller contacted FSS, and advised them of the PIREP's.  About 75 seconds later, Moku 979 reported in to the approach control.  The controller told them to ""expect lower in 5 miles.""  The controller did not advise Moku 979 of the reported turbulence in the area.  Ninety-five seconds later the controller instructed Moku 979 to begin a descent to 1,500 feet.  Fifteen seconds later Moku 979 declared an emergency and reported the injury.an in-flight encounter with clear air turbulence, which resulted in a serious injury to a deadheading crewmember.Sources: ICAO  NTSB Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates25-Sep-2024 11:24 ASN Added 26-Sep-2024 06:39 ASN Updated [Source, ] Corrections or additions? ...

Members Hersman and Sumwalt did not approve this probable cause. Member Hersman filed a dissenting statement, with which Member Sumwalt concurred. Hersman stated that the fracturing of the windshield should be cited as a contributing cause of this accident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CHI07LA063 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Cape Girardeau Airport, MO (CGI/KCGI); February 2007; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Cape Girardeau Airport, MO (CGI/KCGI); February 2007; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Cape Girardeau Airport, MO (CGI/KCGI); February 2007; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Cape Girardeau Airport, MO (CGI/KCGI); February 2007; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

On board were one pilot and five passengers. The pilot received fatal injuries in the accident; the passengers mostly suffered serious injuries. Weather conditions at the time were good, but it was after nightfall; the moon had not risen and there was little cultural lighting in the area. The aircraft crashed into a shallow lagoon approximately one nautical mile south-east of North Caicos Airport. Wreckage was spread along a trail that extended in excess of 370 m along a track of 220Â°(M). The aircraft's fuselage had come to rest comparatively intact, although lying in an inverted attitude. Evidence from the accident site indicated that the aircraft had struck the water in a nominally upright attitude, with only a moderate rate of descent but at relatively high forward speed. From a detailed examination of the wreckage and the circumstances of the accident, it was concluded that the aircraft was structurally intact and probably under control when it struck the surface. The evidence indicated that each engine was producing power throughout the short flight and at the time of impact. Although anomalies were found which suggested that a possible power asymmetry may have existed, this should not have been sufficient to cause the pilot serious control difficulties. None of the passengers described an obvious problem with the aircraft during the flight, and most remained unaware of the impending crash. The circumstances of the accident suggested that the pilot became spatially disorientated, to the extent that the aircraft diverged from its intended flight path and reached an irrecoverable situation. The environmental conditions were conducive to a disorientation event, and a postmortem toxicological examination showed that the pilot had a level of blood alcohol which, although below the prescribed limit, was significant in terms of piloting an aircraft and would have made him more prone to disorientation. The evidence indicated that the pilot had probably started a recovery to normal flight, but too late to prevent the accident. However, his actions had the effect of reducing the descent rate and placing the aircraft in a nearly level attitude at impact. This lessened the impact damage and helped preserve the fuselage structure relatively intact, increasing the passengers' chance of survival. The investigation identified the following causal factors: 1. The aircraft adopted an excessive degree of right bank soon after takeoff. This led to a descending, turning flight path which persisted until the aircraft was too low to make a safe recovery. 2. The pilot probably became spatially disorientated and was unable to recognise or correct the situation in time to prevent the accident. Contributory factors: 1. The environmental conditions were conducive to a spatial disorientation event. 2. The pilot had probably consumed alcohol prior to the flight, which made him more prone to becoming disorientated.  3. The flight was operated single-pilot when two pilots were required under applicable regulations.  The presence of a second pilot would have provided a significant measure of protection against the effects of the flying pilot becoming disorientated.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: 2/2010 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) AAIB; near North Caicos Airport (NCA); February 2007 photo (c) AAIB Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane sustained substantial damage and the three occupants, an airline transport pilot, flight paramedic and flight nurse, were killed. The Emergency Medical Services (EMS) positioning flight departed Great Falls International Airport, MT (GTF), at 20:40. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the departure airport and dark night visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the destination airport. The airplane was approximately 42 nautical miles from the tower-controlled destination airport, when the pilot was cleared for the visual approach. The flight did not arrive at the airport and reports were received that it had crashed. The wreckage was located later that evening approximately 80 feet below the peak of a ridge that rose to an elevation of approximately 5,700 feet.  The airport is located in a large valley and is surrounded by rising mountainous terrain. At night, clouds and terrain are difficult for pilots to see, and a gradual loss of visual cues can occur as flight is continued toward darker terrain. Additionally, the horizon is less visible and less distinct at night than during the day. Because the pilot was descending the airplane over rural, mountainous terrain that provided few visual ground reference cues, and because the overcast cloud layer would have prevented moonlight from illuminating the terrain, it is likely that the pilot did not see the rising terrain as the airplane continued toward it. The airplane was equipped with an Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System; however, impact damage to the unit precluded post accident testing. It is not known how the unit was configured during the flight or what type of alerts the pilot received prior to impact. Post accident examination of the wreckage, to include both engines, did not disclose evidence of a mechanical malfunction prior to impact. Additionally, no evidence was found to suggest an in-flight structural failure.

Weather at the TLZ was good, with a visibility of 25 km, no significant cloud and a light surface wind. The flight to the TLZ was routine and at approx 17:00 UTC the Hercules began to make its approach to the TLZ. Comms had already been established between ZH876 and the Tactical Air Traffic Controller (Tac ATC) at the TLZ, and the aircraft was subsequently cleared to land. An uneventful approach followed flown by the co-pilot. At 17:10:15 UTC, as the aircraft was about to touchdown at the TLZ, the crew experienced a load bang and a bright flash. The flash temporarily blinded the flight-deck crew. Virtually simultaneously, the aircraft touched down. The first flash was followed, a second later, by another flash and louder bang. The aircraft slewed off the left-hand side of the runway. The captain took over control of the aircraft. On regaining vision, the captain tried to steer the aircraft back onto the runway. However, the crew became aware of a fire on the port side, which was confirmed as a wing fire. The captain brought the aircraft to an immediate halt. The aircraft came to rest 50 m from the runway edge, some 700 m after touchdown.  The aircraft sustained substantial damage and it was decided to blow up the plane because the damage was too difficult to repair and there was also a potential risk that anti-Iraqi forces might obtain information on specialist equipment. CONCLUSIONS: ""The evidence recovered from the incident site revealed that two IED [improvised explosive device] arrays had exploded in the near vicinity of ZH876's touchdown point at the TLZ. The Board quickly ruled out aircraft systems failure and other possible causes. The Board concluded that this deliberate enemy action was the sole cause of the damage sustained to ZH876 in this incident.  The Board further concluded that there was a lack of understanding, by the Force Protection personnel, of TLZ sweep procedures and they had not received the appropriate training. This meant that the sweep procedures applied at the TLZ were inadequate to discover the IED arrays.""Accident investigation:   Report number: final reoport Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: Hercules plane destroyed in Iraq (BBC 13-2-2007)  Lyneham Herc kept out of enemy hands (Swindon Advertiser, 13-2-2007)  Military Aircraft Accident Summary (MAAS), Aircraft","Rolls-Royce AE2100D3",NA,"https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20070212-0"

At 14:30 hours the aircraft was rolled out of a heated hangar and towed to the apron of the Vnukovo-3 business terminal. At 15:57 the crew radioed a request to start the engines. This was allowed by ATC and the crew read back:  ""CK, start up approved and we will be ready in 10 to 15 minutes for taxi and take off due to deicing procedure"". At 16:01 the aircraft was towed to the anti-icing platform, where, at the request of the captain, it was processed in two stages by type I and type IV fluids. At 16:18 after the anti-icing treatment of the aircraft was completed, it was towed to the beginning of taxiway 14, where the engines were started. After working the necessary checklists the flight was cleared to taxi to runway 06 for departure. At 16:36 the flight was cleared for takeoff.  The airplane lifted off runway 06 about 1,500 meters from the threshold, and immediately banked sharply to the left. It then banked sharply to the right, hitting the runway with the right wingtip. The airplane continued to roll to the right until it was inverted, and veered off the right side of the runway. It came to rest 1,950 meters from the runway threshold, about 35 meters to the right of the runway's edge. PROBABLE CAUSE (translated from Russian): The accident with the aircraft CRJ100-SE registration number N168CK occurred as a result of loss of the lifting properties of the wing during the take-off phase, which led to the stalling of the aircraft immediately after detachment from the runway, collision of the right wing tip with the surface of the runway, subsequent destruction and fire.  The reason for the loss of the bearing properties of the wing under the actual meteorological conditions (moderate to strong rainfall, temperature minus 6Â°C, dew point minus 7Â°C) was the effect of ground icing, despite the anti-icing treatment that could be caused by a combination of the following factors: - deficiencies in the guidance documents defining the procedure for de-icing aircraft in a two-stage procedure, which resulted in the possibility of a different interpretation of the requirements for the start of a 3-minute interval between the first and second stages of processing;  - non-receipt by the crew of meteorological documentation in full in preparation for the flight and, as a consequence, inability to correctly determine the protective action time of the LOA and failure to take measures to re-process the aircraft;  - violation of the airway route recommended by the AFM, and non-retention of the recommended 3-minute interval between the first and second stages of treatment; - lack of proper control by crew members and / or airline representatives for the completeness and quality of anti-icing treatment;  - non-inclusion by the crew of the PIC wing before take-off, which is a mandatory requirement of the AFM for the actual weather conditions.  The protuberance of the sealant on the upper and lower surfaces of the wing by an amount significantly exceeding the limitation of the current technical conditions, as well as the beginning of the nose wheel lift of the aircraft at a speed of 12 knots less than the recommended one, reduced the margin for the stall angle of attack. The existing procedural method for monitoring the aerodynamic surfaces of the aircraft before departure, along with the inefficiency at the take-off stage of the existing stall protection system, because of the increased sensitivity of the wing, even to a slight contamination of the leading edge, can not fully guarantee the prevention of such incidents in the future.METAR: 13:36 UTC / 16:36 local time: UUWW 131330Z 13005MPS 1000 R06/1000N SHSN VV003 M06/M07 Q1009 TEMPO 0700 +SHSN RMK 06511040 QBB100=wind 130 degrees at 10 kts, visibility 1000 m in snow showers with a 300 ft.vertical visibility, Temperature -6Â°C, Dewpoint -7Â°C,QNH 1009 hPaAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB id NYC07RA064   Location  Images: photo (c) albspotter; Frankfurt International Airport (FRA); 16 November 2006; (CC:by-nc) photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Frankfurt International Airport (FRA/EDDF); November 2006 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The DHC-8-400 had stopped short of the runway, at intersection Holding Position JA1, prior to taking off. The following Boeing 777 was cleared to Holding Position J1, at the beginning of the runway, which involved taxiing beyond JA1. The crew of the B777 were cautioned about the presence of the DHC-8 as they continued towards J1. As the B777 passed behind the DHC-8, its right wingtip struck the DHC-8âs rudder.  The B777 suffered minor scratching to its wingtip. The DHC-8âs rudder was damaged and required replacement. AAIB Analysis Whilst the crew of G-JEDR reported that they had stopped âon the lineâ at the holding position, analysis showed that if the aircraft had been stopped with its nose precisely above the relevant marking, and that AP-BGY had been following the taxiway centreline, the two aircraft would not have collided. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that G-JEDR had stopped a few metres short of the holding position, which was consistent with allowing the crew a view of the stop bar, as is normal aviation practice. The decision by the commander of AP-BGY to deviate slightly from the taxiway centreline, as he passed G-JEDR, was to increase what he considered would be a small miss-distance between the two aircraft. The method used by the GMC controller when directing departing aircraft for either full length or intersection departures, in order to present the Tower controller with opportunities to expedite the flow of traffic, was in accordance with normal ATC practice. Both controllers had expected AP-BGY to hold short of the link to JA1, until G-JEDR had moved forward. The clearances issued, for AP-BGY to taxi to J1, were correct. However, the cautions to the flight crew, which represented essential aerodrome information âto assist him [the pilot] in preventing collisions with parked aircraftâ, as described in MATs Part 1, were not understood by them as meaning that there was a risk of a collision if they taxied past G-JEDR.

The first officer was flying the airplane. The captain reported they were cleared for the ILS runway 24R approach. Approximately 10 minutes prior to landing, air traffic control changed the landing runway to runway 28. The captain stated they were informed that the runway visual range (RVR) was 6,000 feet and that the braking action was fair. Also, the glideslope for the ILS runway 28 approach was unusable at the time of the accident due to the snow. After passing the final approach fix, they were informed that the RVR had decreased to 2,000 feet. The captain had the approach lights in sight and at 50 feet above the ground, he had the runway in sight. The first officer then turned off the autopilot to land. At 30 feet above the ground the captain momentarily lost sight of the runway. He then regained sight of the runway and the airplane was landed. They encountered strong gusty winds during the landing flare and after touchdown they could barely see the runway lights and taxiway turn-offs. Despite the use of full reverse and braking, the airplane did not seem to slow down. The airplane traveled off the runway and into the snow covered grass and went partially through the fence before coming to a stop more than 150 feet past the end of the runway. Runway 28 is 6017 feet long. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the failure of the flight crew to execute a missed approach when visual cues for the runway were not distinct and identifiable. Contributing to the accident were (1) the crewÂs decision to descend to the instrument landing system decision height instead of the localizer (glideslope out) minimum descent altitude; (2) the first officerÂs long landing on a short contaminated runway and the crewÂs failure to use reverse thrust and braking to their maximum effectiveness; (3) the captainÂs fatigue, which affected his ability to effectively plan for and monitor the approach and landing; and (4) Shuttle AmericaÂs failure to administer an attendance policy that permitted flight crewmembers to call in as fatigued without fear of reprisals.""METAR: 20:17 UTC / 15:17 local time: KCLE 182017Z 33013G19KT 1/4SM +SN BKN003 BKN010 OVC015 M08/M11 A3003 RMK AO2 P000020:33 UTC / 15:33 local time: KCLE 182033Z 32013KT 1 1/2SM -SN SCT003 BKN011 OVC028 M08/M11 A3004 RMK AO2 P0000Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NTSB/AAR-08-01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   NTSB/AAR-08/01   Location  Images: photo (c) Chuck Slusarczyk Jr; Cleveland-Hopkins International Airport, OH (CLE/KCLE); 18 February 2007 photo (c) NTSB; Cleveland-Hopkins International Airport, OH (CLE/KCLE); February 2007; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Cleveland-Hopkins International Airport, OH (CLE/KCLE); February 2007; (publicdomain) photo (c) aeroprints.com; Rantoul, KS; 30 April 2013; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) aeroprints.com; Rantoul, KS; 30 April 2013; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The international air carrier flight was in cruise flight at the time of the accident.  The captain stated the flight ""encountered a brief (2-3 second) but very intense moderate-to-severe turbulence event"" at flight level 340.  He noted that continuous moderate turbulence continued for approximately 30 seconds, and periods of occasional-to-continuous moderate chop continued for about 10 minutes after the initial encounter.  He added that there were no returns on the weather radar, and no pilot reports or adverse ride reports received from air traffic control.  The fasten seat belt sign was on at the time of the encounter because the flight had encountered light chop after leveling off at cruise altitude.  He reported that the ride had been smooth for approximately 10 minutes prior to the turbulence event.

After the right generator came online an electrical failure occurred in the right main bus. The failure resulted in severe internal arcing and short circuits inside the two main power contactors of the right main bus. The heat generated during the failure resulted in the contactor casings becoming compromised, causing molten metal droplets to fall down onto the insulation blankets below. The insulation blankets ignited and a fire spread underneath a floor panel to the opposite electrical panel (P205), causing heat and fire damage to structure, cooling ducts and wiring. The flight crew responded to the bus failure and a burning smell by shutting down the right engine and taxiing to a nearby stand. The Airfield Fire Service attended the aircraft when it arrived on stand and entered the Main Equipment Centre where they discovered significant smoke but no fire. The passengers were evacuated uneventfully via steps. CAUSAL FACTORS: 1. An internal failure of the Right Generator Circuit Breaker or Right Bus Tie Breaker contactor on the P200 power panel inside the Main Equipment Centre resulted in severe internal arcing and short-circuits which melted the contactor casings. The root cause of contactor failure could not be determined. 2. The open base of the P200 power panel allowed molten metal droplets from the failed contactors to drop down onto the insulation blankets and ignite them. 3. The aircraftÂs electrical protection system was not designed to detect and rapidly remove power from a contactor suffering from severe internal arcing and short-circuits. 4. The contactors had internal design features that probably contributed to the uncontained failures.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: AAIB AAR 2/2009 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ  History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  13 December 1999 N786UA United Airlines 0 NW of London-Heathrow Airport (LHR/EGLL) non Turbulence 13 September 2023 N786UA United Airlines 0 30 nm W of Yarmouth, NS non Loss of pressurization Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight that had been initially planned for 26th February 2007, was postponed several times due to adverse meteorological conditions, causing problems with provision supply on Ruhnu island. On Friday, 3rd March, pilot checked the weather at 15:00 and at 16:00. Based on the received information the pilot decided to depart for Ruhnu at 16:00. At 16:08, the aircraft took off from PÃ¤rnu airport with a pilot, two passengers and 520 kg of cargo on board. According to the weather briefing received by the pilot via telephone from Kuressaare, at 16:00 the cloud height in Kuressaare (EEKE, 36 Nm northwest of Ruhnu) was 600 ft. and 180 m (approximately 540 ft.) in Ruhnu. During the uneventful flight on the altitude 1500 ft., the coast and the ice border were clearly visible. The aircraft stayed clear from the clouds and no signs of icing were noticed by persons on board. Approaching the island from the northeast it was intended by the pilot to use runway 32 for landing. The pilot decided to fly low from east to west across the runway to check the windsock and runway condition. While approaching the island, the pilot descended at the rate of 150 ft/min with low power settings and flaps extended by 1 notch. During descent the horizontal and vertical visibility deteriorated and the flight was continued in IMC. The descent was continued in clouds; therefore the pilot had no visual contact with the ground and horizon. The aircraft broke through the clouds over the coast at a very low altitude (100-120 feet). Trying to maintain safe altitude and speed pilot added power, at the same time stall warning signal activated and seconds later the lower part of aircraft's fuselage touched the treetops and collided with the terrain at 16:36.  The passengers and pilot escaped the aircraft without assistance and with no injuries. Causes of the accident: The investigation established the following causes of the accident: 1. The pilot could not maintain safe flight altitude when approaching Ruhnu aerodrome. 2. The pilot continued the descent in spite of IMC. Contributing factors to the accident The investigation established the following factors contributing to the accident: 1. High motivation to perform the flight. 2. Inadequate weather information from ground services of Ruhnu aerodrome. 3. Inadequate aeronautical oversight in the destination airport.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MinEcon Report number: EE030/030307 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 years and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Delfi  Images: photo (c) Karl KrÃ¤mer, via Werner Fischdick; Harle Airport (EDXP); August 2003 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Garuda flight 200 was an early morning service from Jakarta (CGK) to Yogyakarta (JOG). The pilot in command (PIC) was the pilot flying, and the copilot was the support/monitoring pilot. The PIC intended to make an instrument landing system (ILS) approach to runway 09 at Yogyakarta and briefed the copilot accordingly. Yogya Approach cleared the aircraft for a visual approach, with a requirement to proceed to long final and report runway in sight. Although the crew acknowledged the visual approach clearance, they continued with the ILS approach, but did not inform the controller. The descent and approach were conducted in visual meteorological conditions. At 07:55:33, when the aircraft was 10.1 miles from the runway, it was 1,427 feet above the initial fix of 2,500 feet published in the approach chart, and the airspeed was 283 knots. The pilot in command descended the aircraft steeply in an attempt to reach the runway, but in doing so, the airspeed increased excessively. As the aircraft was being flown at speeds that were in excess of the wing flaps operation speed, the copilot elected not to extend the flaps as instructed by the PIC. During the approach, the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) alerts and warnings sounded 15 times and the copilot called for the PIC to go around. The PIC continued the approach with flaps 5 degrees, and the aircraft attained the glideslope near the runway 09 threshold. Flaps 5 degrees is not a landing flap setting. The aircraft crossed the threshold, 89 feet above the runway, at an airspeed of 232 knots, 98 knots faster than the required landing speed for flaps 40 degrees. The wind was north easterly at 9 knots. The groundspeed was 235 knots. The aircraft touched down at an airspeed of 221 knots, 87 knots faster than landing speed for 40 degrees flap. Shortly after touching down, the copilot called, with high intonation, for the PIC to go around. The aircraft overran the departure end of runway 09, to the right of the centerline at 110 knots. The aircraft crossed a road, and impacted an embankment before stopping in a rice paddy field 252 meters from the threshold of runway 27 (departure end of runway 09). The aircraft destroyed by the impact forces and an intense, fuel-fed, post-impact fire. CAUSES:  ""1. Flight crew communication and coordination was less than effective after the aircraft passed 2,336 feet on descent after flap 1 was selected. Therefore the safety of the flight was compromized.  2. The PIC flew the aircraft at an excessively high airspeed and steep descent during the approach. The crew did not abort the approach when stabilized approach criteria were not met. 3. The pilot in command did not act on the 15 GPWS alerts and warnings, and the two calls from the copilot to go around. 4. The copilot did not follow company instructions and take control of the aircraft from the pilot in command when he saw that the pilot in command repeatedly ignored warnings to go around. 5. Garuda did not provide simulator training for its Boeing 737 flight crews covering vital actions and required responses to GPWS and EGPWS alerts and warnings such as ÂTOO LOW TERRAINÂ and ÂWHOOP, WHOOP PULL UPÂ.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSC Report number: KNKT.07.03.05.04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   KNKT  NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) I.

There were 56 passengers and four crew members on board. There were no injuries. All Nippon Airways flight 1603 took off from Osaka (ITM) at 08:21 on a regular domestic flight to Kochi. At 08:47 the flight was given clearance to land on runway 32. However, when configuring the aircraft for landing, it appeared that the nose landing gear would not deploy. The approach was abandoned and the airplane entered a holding pattern. The crew members attempted to deploy the nose undercarriage but the attempts failed. Two low passes were flown, at 500 feet over the runway. The crew then attempted to extend the nose landing gear by utilizing acceleration force during a steep turn. When this did not work, a touch-and-go was made so as to apply an impact to the nose landing gear. The flight crew when concluded that they had to make a landing with the nose gear retracted. The captain directed the cabin attendants to move some passengers to aft cabin and fire extinguishing agent was sprayed on the runway. At 10:54 a landing was carried out. The airplane sustained structural damage on the lower part of the forward fuselage. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""It is recognized that this accident was caused by that, in spite of gear down operations in flight by normal and alternative procedures, the nose landing gear could not be extended because the doors of the nose landing gear remained closed, and when the Aircraft landed in this configuration, the lower part of the forward fuselage contacted the runway surface and was damaged. It is recognized that the doors of the nose landing gear remained closed because the spacer migrated out from the hinge part of the toggle link assy, which was part of the nose landing gear door linkage mechanism, interfered with the support fitting, thereby prevented the movement of the toggle link assy, which resulted in restraining the movement of the entire nose landing gear door linkage mechanism. It is estimated that the spacer migrated out because the bolt, nut and the like were not installed, and the spacer was gradually pulled aft out of the toggle link assy under the influence of retractions/extensions of the nose landing gear, airframe vibration, aircraft acceleration and so on, during operations of the Aircraft. Regarding that the bolt, nut and the like were not installed, it is considered that these parts were not re-installed at the time of the repair in the manufacturing process of the Aircraft.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JTSB Report number: AA2008-5 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  17 March 2019 RA-67252 Aurora 0 Kupol Airport (KPX) non 8 July 2020 RA-67252 Aurora 0 Yuzhno-Kurilsk Mendeleyevo Airport non Taxiway excursion 8 January 2025 RA-67252 Aurora 0 near Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Airport (UUS/UHSS), Sakhalin Oblast non 22 February 2025 RA-67252 Aurora 0 near Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Airport (UUS/UHSS), Sakhalin Oblast non Bird strike Location  Images: photo (c) JTSB; Kochi Airport (KCZ/RJOK); March 2007 photo (c) JTSB; Kochi Airport (KCZ/RJOK); March 2007 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The captain reported that the landing lights illuminated the ducks and in less than a second the airplane struck the ducks. The left engine fan blade was struck by 3-5 ducks at the midspan shroud liberating the fan blade tip, which was contained.  The impact resulted in movement of the variable stator vanes and 2.5 bleed valves. The engine then made an uncommanded shutdown. The hydraulic pressure supply manifold broke due to high vibratory fatigue after the impact, which also resulted in minimizing the amount of fuel released into the engine nacelle. The airplane returned for landing at the departure airport without further incident.

Tambo International Airport (FAJS) to Durban International Airport (FADN) and arrived at FADN at 1915Z. According to the pilot, they used the aircraft's weather radar to help them avoid adverse weather during the descent to FADN. The radar operated satisfactorily during the descent and approach for landing. After landing at FADN, the aircraft was turned around in 45 minutes for the return flight SA6582 to FAJS. The crew taxied to runway 06, the active runway at the time, but just prior to take-off, ATC advised the pilot that a Boeing B737-800 had had to execute a go-round due to a tailwind component with the surface wind at 240/15kt. The pilot and co-pilot repositioned the aircraft and prepared to take off from runway 24. The fire crew reported that there was no standing water on the runway, although it was raining quite heavily. From their position at the threshold of runway 24, the pilot carefully scanned the area with the weather radar but this showed no returns. The Boeing B737-800 which approached from that direction supported the radar information that it was safe for take-off. After the co-pilot (pilot-flying) concurred with the pilot (pilot non-flying) that it was safe for take-off, they obtained take-off clearance from the ATC. Maximum thrust on both engines was selected and the aircraft climbed away steeply. As there were no radar returns indicated ahead or to the right of the aircraft, the co-pilot commenced the right-hand turn towards the Greytown VOR (GYV) at an IAS of 280 kts. The pilot and co-pilot individually checked that the weather radar settings were correct and adjusted the tilt, gain, range and stab settings but no green, yellow or red returns appeared on the radar. At 9 000ft AMSL, light hail was encountered and the crew selected the 'Engine Anti-Ice'? as well as the 'Low Ignition'? switches to the ON position. The hail seemed to lessen but shortly thereafter, it became much worse with the radar screen still remaining completely clear. The co-pilot then made a 30 degree turn to the right and the captain asked ATC if they had any weather returns on their radar, but due to the noise of the hail on the fuselage, ATC was unable to hear the transmission clearly. Some moderate turbulence was experienced which became severe in short bursts. At this stage, the captain and co-pilot had to communicate using hand signals. The captain scanned the radar in an attempt to find a clear path through the clouds and also monitored the co-pilot's flying. All engine parameters remained normal. The aircraft continued climbing in a north-easterly direction and at 15 000 ft AMSL, cleared the clouds and continued to its destination without further incident.  Probable Cause The aircraft encountered severe hail during climb-out after taking off from Durban International Airport. The aircraft's weather radar did not show any hail on the radar screen.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CAA S.A.

None of the four crewmembers or two passengers were injured. The air ambulance flight was flying a GPS runway 16 approach at Beverly (BVY). After passing the initial approach fix they entered a cloud, and noticed that there was ""quite a bit of wind"" which they had to compensate for. Moments later, the first officer noticed that they were picking up a trace amount of rime ice on the windscreen; however, since neither pilot saw any ice on the wings, the de-icing boots were never activated. As they neared the final approach fix (FAF), they ""added a notch"" of approach flaps, and then added full flaps when they crossed the FAF. After reaching the minimum descent altitude, they acquired the field and the visual approach slope indicator (VASI). Once established on the VASI, the approach to landing seemed normal until reaching approximately 100 feet above ground level. The crew then experienced what they described as a ""burble,"" and the airplane rolled ""steeply"" to the right, striking the surface of the runway overrun area. After landing and taxiing to the ramp, the flight crew conducted a postflight inspection of the airplane. They noted that approximately 4 feet of the right wing was bent upward about 10 degrees, and ""Light rime ice"" was present on the leading edges of the wings, horizontal stabilizer and radome. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The inadequate guidance and procedures provided by the airplane manufacturer regarding operation of the pneumatic de-icing boots.

Upon departure from Surgut, the weather at Samara was below minima with a visibility of 200 m in fog. An improvement was expected to a visibility of 3000 m upon arrival. The Tupolev Tu-134 took off at 04:08 UTC, climbing to the cruising altitude of 10600 m. En route weather reports showed an improvement to a visibility of 1500 m at Samara.  At 06:18 UTC (11:18 local time), shortly after contacting Samara Control, the captain briefed the crew about the arrival procedures for Samara. During the briefing he incorrectly stated that the altitude at which they would capture the glide slope was 500 m (the actual height is 400 m according to the approach charts). About 06:22, Samara Control cleared the flight to descend to 5400 m. During their descent, about 06:30, the ground wind at Samara Airport changed direction from west (270-290Â°) to southeast (120Â°) with fog again worsening the visibility. Samara Approach cleared the flight further down to 2400 m and reported of 1200 m with haze and fog. At 06:35 the crew received further clearances in preparation for an approach to runway 23 and the controller reported pressure at the airfield being 745 mm Hg. At 06:37 visibility dropped to 800 m. The meteorological station officer did not inform air traffic control, although he was aware of this significant drop in visibility. Shortly afterward a visibility of 608 m was registered, which was below airport landing minima. This value was not noted by the met station officer and thus not passed on to ATC. At 06:38:53 the flight reported at 400 m. The crew was then instructed to contact the Samara Landing controller, which they did. At 06:40 UCT air traffic control contacted the met station to inquire about the cloud base and horizontal visibility. The met officer reported fog with 800 m visibility but did not mention the cloud base. The cloud base according to the latest ATIS information was 490 m. The actual cloud base measured at the time of the approach was about 30 m. At 06:40:10, at a speed of 380 km/h, the flight engineer lowered the landing gear and the captain trimmed the stabilizer. At 06:40:43, at a speed of 350 km/h, the flaps were extended to 20 degrees. At the same time, the Tu-134 was 10 km on finals, the controller reported the (incorrect) visibility of ""800 m in fog"". At 06:41:09., 8 km out, at a speed of 320 km/h, the flaps were set at 30 degrees.  At 06:41:45 the airplane passed the Outer Marker at 200 m. The navigator failed to inform the crew that they had passed the Outer Marker. Thus the pilot did not inform the controller, in order to obtain landing clearance. When the controller inquired about their position, the crew reported ready for landing. At 06:41:55 they were cleared to land. The vertical rate of descent was 6 m/s, which exceeded the recommended rate of descent. The aircraft passed the Inner Marker at a height of 60 m, and a vertical rate of descent of 5,5 m/s with a lateral deviation from the runway axis to the right, no less than 40 m with a further tendency to the right. At decision height the crew had not established positive visual contact with the approach lights. The approach was continued until the airplane contacted the ground, at 06:42:33, 300 m short of the runway and 100 m to the right of the extended centreline. The left wing separated from the fuselage and the plane rolled on its back. The Technical Commission came to the following conclusion: The reason for the crash of TU-134A RA-65021 during the approach to landing at Kurumoch Airport, Samara, in weather conditions significantly below minima for the airport, aircraft, and crew, was the destruction of the aircraft during its travel over the ground after a hard touchdown 300 meters short of the runway and 100 meters to the right of the approach course. The accident resulted from organizational, technical, and procedural deficiencies in the work and interaction of the weather and air traffic control services, as well as from crew errors. Deficiencies in the standards and technical documentation of the Samara Airport made it impossible for Air Traffic Control to inform the crew on a timely basis of the readings from the KRAMS-4 weather station, which indicated a deterioration of weather conditions below airport minima. At decision height, in the absence of reliable visual contact with the approach lights and airport environment, the flight crew did not make a timely decision to execute a missed approach. The air traffic controllerÂs failure to use the full capability of the radar equipment because of contradictions in the relevant standards and procedures documents, as well as poor coordination among the flight crew and their delay in executing a missed approach, made it impossible to avoid a tragedy. The lack of unified federal regulations covering flight operations, Air Traffic Control, and weather and other services, taking into account both domestic and international experience in flight safety, contributed to this aviation accident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: ITAR-TASS  MAK Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC)   Location  Images: photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Praha-Ruzyne International Airport (PRG/LKPR); June 1999 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The crew reported the en route portion of the flight was uneventful. As the airplane approached RIL, the crew checked the automated surface observing system (ASOS) report which reported the sky overcast at 4,000 feet and no rain. During the downwind leg to runway 26, the crew could see the runway. Prior to the final approach fix for the ILS approach to runway 26 and approximately 8 miles from the airport, the crew had the runway in sight. The crew communicated their intentions on the RIL common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF). The pilot flew the airplane on the glideslope approximately Vref (Final Approach Speed) 128 knots plus 10-15 knots, then below 1,000 feet, Vref plus 10 knots. The pilot stated that the airplane touched down approximately 1,500 feet from the approach end of runway 26. The co-pilot reported the airbrake was in the #2 position and they had ""good anti-skid indication"" after touchdown. The pilot ""began braking, deployed the thrust reverser, and continued to increase brake pressure as it didn't seem like a normal deceleration rate. With approximately 2,500 feet of runway remaining, the airplane continued to not decelerate normally, and the pilot knew they did not have enough runway to execute a go-around. With approximately 1,000 feet of runway remaining, the pilot pulled the parking brake to the second detent, and the aircraft slid off the end of the runway into the dirt and muddy terrain. It came to rest 268 feet past the runway end. The right main landing gear trunnion had sheared from its attach points, rotated up and punctured wing skin. The main landing gear strut impacted the aft spar and sheared rib 3, which compromised the wing fuel tank. The forward main landing gear trunnion exited the forward trunnion bore, and the aft spar was fractured. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The pilot's improper decision to land with excessive airspeed during the approach and failure to obtain the proper touchdown point, which resulted in a runway overrun.

The airplane received substantial damage. One passenger received minor injuries.  The flight originated from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, at 12:55.  The flight crew was in cruise flight when a master caution light illuminated indicating a loss of the right hydraulic system pressure and hydraulic fluid. The crew used the checklist to trouble shoot the system and attempted to manually extend the main and nose landing gear (NLG) using the alternate extension control lever. Both main gear extended and locked into place; however the NLG did not extend. The airplane was landed with the NLG in the retracted position. Initial inspection of the airplane revealed that a B-nut to the check valve on the rudder power hydraulic shut off valve, was separated from the valve resulting in a total loss of right hydraulic quantity and pressure. Examination of the hydraulic tube, including the B-nut and check valve, did not reveal any abnormalities. Examination of the cockpit revealed the landing gear handle was in the stowed position. A placard on the alternate landing gear extension lever stated, ""Pull up forcibly Full Stroke."" The airplane was placed on jacks and maintenance personnel successfully extended the nose landing gear. The alternate gear extension control system was also inspected and no defects were noted.

CONCLUSION The cause of the accident during the engine start-up process was the displacement of the aircraft forward and toward the left due to a higher power setting in the engines of the right wing, which caused the No. 3 engine to strike the ground power unit that was positioned in front of the right wing. It was a series of events that contributed to the incident: a) The removal of chocks by ground personnel without having taken them as a precaution and safety measure first, which led to the decision to move the ground power unit that was in front of the right wing of the aircraft. b) Not using ground-to-cabin communication headsets between the cabin crew and the ground technical staff. c) Failing to provide a training course to the ground staff by PHOENIX to GIRAG on the operational procedures on the ground for their aircraft. d) Not taking immediate precautions by the crew concerning the limits that the aircraft had when it lost hydraulic pressure. e) Not ensuring that the parking brakes were set and engaged. f) Not operating the air emergency brake lever by the crew members (Captain or Co-pilot) when they noticed that the aircraft started moving forward for no apparent reason, despite having two levers, one in front of each crew member.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAC El Salvador Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: https://portal.aeronautica.gob.pa/upia/archivo/54245_XA-AEG_-29.08.2024_informe_final.pdf Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates18-Jan-2025 17:29 ASN Updated [Time, Source, Damage, Narrative, Accident report, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight was due to land at Hoskins and Rabaul. An area forecast for the flight indicated that there were areas of rain and scattered cloud from 1500-5000 feet with deteriorating conditions forecast for the period between 0400-0800 hours. Last radio contact with the flight was at 05:06 when the crew advised Port Moresby Flight Service that they were overhead Maran. The airplane was declared missing when it failed to arrive at Hoskins and the wreckage was located later that day in a wooded area at an elevation of 238 m. An investigation revealed that the right engine had been shut down and the fire extinguisher for the engine had been activated. However, there was no evidence of in-flight fire in the engine. The airplane descended below the en-route lowest safe altitude of 8,300 feet. At some point the undercarriage was extended. In total darkness, at 05:23, the airplane struck tree tops on gentle sloping terrain. The right wing broke off and the aircraft slid for another 300 m before coming to rest.

The airplane was near the eastern shore of Lake Michigan, about 35 miles west-northwest of Grand Rapids, Michigan, when the accident occurred.  The flight crew received a left thrust reverser unlock indication while holding for takeoff. The captain cycled the reverser, and had decided to return to the gate when the messages cleared. With the issue apparently resolved, he elected to takeoff. The captain reported experiencing a small vibration on climb out and, a short time later, he heard a ""loud bang"" and the ""aircraft pitched and yawed/rolled to [the] left."" The autopilot disengaged and the left thrust lever moved to idle during the event. The first officer ran the checklist to stow the reverser. The captain decided to continue to the intended destination because the thrust reverser messages had cleared and the vibrations had stopped. The flight subsequently landed uneventfully. The flight data recorder (FDR) indicated that the left engine vibration levels were elevated during the accident flight. Approximately 3 minutes into the flight, the left engine thrust reverser unlocked parameter changed to ""On"" for about 1 second. About 11 minutes and 20 seconds after takeoff, the left engine vibration level increased momentarily, and both the left and right engine speeds and fuel flows began to decrease. As the decrease in fuel flows was occurring, the airplane rolled right, left, and right again over about a 4-second period. The decrease in engine parameters lasted over 3 minutes before returning to normal. The left engine thrust reverser unlock parameter indicated ""On"" for about 4 seconds during that time. The left engine vibration levels decreased after the event, below the levels previously recorded during the flight, and approximately to the level of the right engine vibration. The vibration and engine speed variations suggested separation of the left engine translating cowling at that point. The left engine thrust reverser deploy parameter remained in the ""Off"" state for the entire flight. Additionally, the FDR data revealed that the left engine vibration levels were elevated and left engine thrust reverser did not deploy on the two previous flights. The post accident inspection revealed that the left engine translating cowl had separated from the engine assembly and damaged the empennage. Damage to the thrust reverser components was consistent with prior operation with the reverser out of alignment and jamming of the translating structure. In-flight separation of the left engine thrust reverser translating cowling due to intermittent binding and jamming of the reverser on the accident flight and on previous flights. Contributing factors were the inadequate maintenance action by the operator due to their failure to properly resolve the prior reverser malfunctions, the failure of the pilots of previous flights in not referring earlier reverser deployment failures for maintenance action, and incomplete company/manufacturer's procedures because they did not address anomalous reverser indications during ground operations.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CHI07FA107 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft was extensively damaged as a result of the collapse. No injuries were sustained by the pilot or passengers from the accident.  Approximately two hours earlier, the aircraft was chartered to fly from Perth to Mount Hale, WA when shortly after takeoff from Perth the aircraft experienced a malfunction of the landing gear system. The main wheels and nose gear had become jammed and were unable to fully retract when selected up by the pilot.  The pilot completed the emergency checklist actions contained in the Aircraft Flight Manual, but was unable to retract or extend the gear using either the automated control or the manual emergency system. The pilot then requested assistance from a passenger to operate the manual emergency extension system.  The landing gear remained jammed despite the additional force applied to the lever from the passenger.  The pilot contacted air traffic services and requested further assistance from company engineering personnel to visually assess the extension state of the landing gear. Two aerodrome passes were completed throughout the troubleshooting exercise and the pilot remained in radio contact with both groups during this phase.  Following the flyovers and after holding over Rottnest Island at 5,000 ft for a period of approximately two hours, the pilot flew the King Air back to Perth airport.  With the gear still jammed in the partially retracted position, both the left and right main landing gear assemblies collapsed after the aircraft touched down on runway 24. The aircraft was substantially damaged as a result of the collapse. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau investigation revealed that two major system components had failed which could have prevented the landing gear from properly retracting/extending; the geared components within the right main landing gear actuator had fractured, and the left torque tube support bearing had seized from contamination and lack of lubrication. Although each component failure was apparently unrelated, the examination was not able to conclusively establish which failure had been the primary contributing factor in this landing occurrence. The Super King Air 200 aircraft landing gear system configuration was such that should either one of these component assemblies cease to function, extension or retraction of the landing gear would not have been possible.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ATSB Report number: 200702171 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: ATSB History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  18 January 2005 VH-SGT Network Aviation Australia 0 Perth Airport, WA (PER) sub Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

After the landing gear was in up-position, the vibration disappeared. The flight crew continued the flight normally to the destination. During flight, the flight crew was notified by another company aircraft departed after GA602, that they observed tire debris left on the runway. There was no abnormality during cruise.   During approach briefing, the PIC also  briefed the possibility of landing with one tire has burst. Although landing at maximum landing weight was permitted, the PIC requested a 30 minutes holding to the ATC in order to reduce landing weight.

Automatic weather observation data indicated at 00:30, the visibility was one-half mile in snow, with indefinite ceiling and vertical visibility of 200 feet. Snow removal operations were in progress at the airport, and the flight crew communicated directly with airport operations regarding the runway conditions. After landing, the airplane overran the departure end of runway 28, which is 6,501 feet long, with an additional 200 feet of pavement.

This poor decision-making likely reflected the effects of fatigue produced by a long, demanding duty day; and, for the captain, the duties associated with check airman functions. Contributing to the accident were 1) the Federal Aviation Administration pilot flight and duty time regulations that permitted the pilotsÂ long, demanding duty day and 2) the TVC operations supervisorÂs use of ambiguous and unspecific radio phraseology in providing runway braking information.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NTSB/AAR-08-02 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   NTSB press release April 24, 2007  Pinnacle Airlines Flight 4712 (Pinnacle Airlines news release 12-4-2007)   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Traverse City Airport, MI (TVC/KTVC); 12 April 2007; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The captain advised the flight attendants to have the cabin secured and be in their seats within 15 minutes.  The first officer gave the 'prepare for landing' announcement in the descent around flight level FL250 (25,000 feet), which was after the captain had notified the flight attendants to prepare the cabin, but before the end of the stated 15 minutes.  While descending through 15,500 feet, the airplane experienced a moderate 'jolt' lasting 1-2 seconds.  By this time it had been more than 15 minutes since the captain gave the flight attendants the secure cabin instructions.  The cabin crew reported injuries to all flight attendants and no injuries to passengers.  All six flight attendants received medical attention after landing.  One flight attendant was seriously injured with a closed fibular fracture; the five other flight attendants had minor injuries.  The first officer said that turbulence during their departure had been very bad, therefore, in order to mitigate any passenger anxiety, when he made the 'prepare for landing' announcement, he added that the turbulence would not be as bad as it was on departure.  He understood the captain's instructions to the flight attendants, and this announcement was aimed solely at the passengers. The flight attendants confirmed that they understood the captain's instructions to have the cabin cleaned up and be seated within 15 minutes.  As they were finishing the cabin clean up, the first officer's 'prepare for landing' announcement indicated that the turbulence would not be as bad as they had been told to expect.  The flight attendants may have interpreted this added information concerning turbulence as a relaxation of the captain's earlier instructions.  The Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR) indicated the turbulence occurred as the aircraft was coming out of a 12-degree right bank and descending through 15,400 pressure altitude.  The event lasted approximately 10-11 seconds.  The bank angle of the aircraft was between 8 and 1 degrees right wing down during the event.  Vertical acceleration fluctuated between .5 and 2.06 G's.  Longitudinal acceleration spiked up to .2 G's about the same time as the 2 G vertical spike.  Lateral acceleration fluctuated between .1 G left and .05 G's to the right during the incident.  The data showed that the autopilot was engaged and in control of the aircraft during the incident. Probable Cause: The flight's encounter with a turbulence event that occurred while the flight attendants were unseated.  Contributing to the accident was the apparent conflicting information provided by the flight deck to the flight attendants and the flight attendants' interpretation of that information.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: LAX07LA127 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB LAX07LA127  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates25-Mar-2024 08:44 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

At the same time, the two people assigned to the push-back vehicle were busy disconnecting the towbar connected to the aircraft. A mechanic, in contact with the pilot by wire, removed the steering lock pin. At this point, the Ground controller authorised the crew to taxi behind a B 777. They started taxiing while the push-back vehicle and the three people were still under the aircraft. A few seconds later, engine number 3 hit the pushback vehicle, which was dragged for about twenty metres. The three people on the ground moved away from the area. The aircraft was flown to Tel Aviv on April 16 and resumed regular service on April 18. CONCLUSION Taxiing was started without the procedures for ensuring that the safety zone had been cleared having been applied.

The fire was probably caused by either an electrical spark, or arc from a faulty light, or by an electrostatic discharge from paint spraying equipment while the aircraft was in interior painting works. Contributory factors: (i) The painting process could have generated a layer of flammable vapor close to the cabin floor which may have led to creating flammable vapor pockets under the polythene sheets. (ii) The spread of the fire was probably exacerbated by the lack of fire extinguishers and the quantity of used paint cans, rags, polythene sheets and chemicals existent in the aircraft.

All 108 passengers and six crew members were killed in the accident. The airplane was operated by Kenya Airways as flight KQ507 from Abidjan Airport (ABJ), Ivory Coast to Nairobi (NBO), Kenya via Douala (DLA), Cameroon. The flight from Abidjan to Douala was reportedly conducted without incident.  The flight arrived about 22:00 hours local time, May 4. The scheduled departure time of 23:00 was delayed due to weather which consisted of thunderstorms with heavy rain showers. When the weather improved, flight 507 taxied to runway 12. The aircraft took off and climbed into the dark night. There were no external visual references, yet no instrument scanning was done by the crew. At 1000 feet climbing, the pilot flying released the flight controls for 55 seconds without having engaged the autopilot. The bank angle of the airplane increased continuously by itself very slowly up to 34 degrees right and the captain appeared unaware of the airplaneÂs changing attitude. Just before the ""Bank Angle"" warning sounds, the captain grabbed the controls, appeared confused about the attitude of the airplane, and made corrections in an erratic manner increasing the bank angle to 50 degrees right. At about 50 degrees bank angle, the autopilot was engaged and the inclination tended to stabilize; then movements of the flight controls by the pilot resumed and the bank angle increased towards 70 degrees right. A prolonged right rudder input brought the bank angle to beyond 90 degrees. The airplane descended in a spiral dive and crashed into a mangrove swamp. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The airplane crashed after loss of control by the crew as a result of spatial disorientation (non recognized or subtle type transitioning to recognized spatial disorientation), after a long slow roll, during which no instrument scanning was done, and in the absence of external visual references in a dark night.  Inadequate operational control, lack of crew coordination, coupled with the non-adherence to procedures of flight monitoring, confusion in the utilization of the AP, have also contributed to cause this situation.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CCAA Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Kenya Airways press release  Kenya Airways plane crashes in Cameroon: radio (AP, 5-5-2007)  Reconstructing the last moments of Kenya Airways Flight 507 (AP, 12-5-2007)  Cameroon Civil Aviation Authority press release   Location  Images: photo (c) Tom Lo; London-Heathrow Airport (LHR/EGLL); 29 October 2006 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight crew donned their oxygen masks and diverted to the closest airport in point of time, and landed uneventfully. Postflight inspection of the accident airplane revealed a 12-inch by 5-inch fuselage skin tear, approximately 6 feet forward of the forward cargo door. During the course of the investigation it was revealed that at some point during the aircraft luggage off-loading or loading process, the engine of the belt loader quit operating. The senior of three ground agents working the flight decided to move the belt loader away from the airplane by pushing the belt loader with a luggage tug; however, during the attempt to move the belt loader, the tugâs cab contacted the fuselage. The senior ground agent then advised âdonât say anythingâ to one of the other employees who was working the flight with him, and the airplane departed and later depressurized.

The pilot, the sole occupant in the airplane, was not injured. The pilot was flying on an activated instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan, which had an intended destination of Kalispell, Montana. The pilot said that he had departed from Billings, Montana, and had climbed to 12,000 feet. About 40 nautical miles northwest of Billings, he heard a ""clunk"" and the red unsafe light in the gear handle came on. He verified that all systems were functioning normally, and he cycled the landing gear up and down to see if that would solve the problem. The unsafe light remained illuminated. The pilot returned to Billings and circled for several hours to burn his fuel load down. He said that at one point he flew low over the runway so the company mechanic, with the aid of a light from an airport vehicle, could visually check the nose gear position. It was hanging out of the wheel well at approximately a 45-degree angle. Upon landing at Billings, the airplane settled to its nose during landing rollout.  Examination of the airplane by an FAA inspector revealed that the nose gear actuator mount bracket area was bent and wrinkled. The nose gear actuator shaft had fractured just above the clevis bolt, which attaches to the drag brace. The failed actuator had been installed on July 26, 2006. The Beech B99 maintenance manual states that the hydraulic actuator needs to be overhauled or replaced every 10,000 hours; maintenance records indicate that this one had 231.4 hours on it at the time of the accident. Metallurgists from both the National Transportation Safety Board and Hawker Beechcraft Corporation examined the failed actuator. Both concluded that all of the fractures were overstress, and no preexisting fatigue signatures were evident.

There were no injuries to any crew or passengers.  Flight 8911 departed Moncton (YQM) on a domestic flight to Toronto. The aircraft landed on runway 06Rwith a 90 degree crosswind from the left, gusting from 13 to 23 knots. The aircraft first contacted the runway in a left-wing-down sideslip. The left main landing gear struck the runway first and the aircraft sustained a sharp lateral side load before bouncing. Once airborne again, the flight and ground spoilers deployed and the aircraft landed hard. Both main landing gear trunnion fittings failed and the landing gear collapsed. The aircraft remained upright, supported by the landing gear struts and wheels. The aircraft slid down the runway and exited via the Delta 3 taxiway, where the passengers deplaned. There was no fire. There were no injuries to the crew; some passengers reported minor injuries as a result of the hard landing. FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1. On final approach, the captain diverted his attention from monitoring the flight, leaving most of the decision making and control of the aircraft to the first officer, who was significantly less experienced on the aircraft type. As a result, the first officer was not fully supervised during the late stages of the approach. 2. The first officer did not adhere to the Air Canada Jazz standard operating procedures (SOPs) in the handling of the autopilot and thrust levers on short final, which left the aircraft highly susceptible to a bounce, and without the bounce protection normally provided by the ground lift dump (GLD) system. 3. Neither the aircraft operating manual nor the training that both pilots had received mentioned the importance of conducting a balked or rejected landing when the aircraft bounces. Given the low-energy state of the aircraft at the time of the bounce, the first officer attempted to salvage the landing. 4. When the thrust levers were reduced to idle after the bounce, the GLD system activated. The resultant sink rate after the GLD system deployed was beyond the certification standard for the landing gear and resulted in the landing gear trunnion fitting failures. 5. There was insufficient quality control at the landing gear overhaul facility, which allowed non-airworthy equipment to enter into service. The condition of the shock struts would have contributed to the bounce.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A07O0124 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources: CADORS Number: 2007O081   Location  Images: photo (c) Never Was An Arrow II; Toronto-Pearson International Airport, ON (YYZ/CYYZ); 20 May 2007; (CC:by-nc-nd) photo (c) Never Was An Arrow II; Toronto-Pearson International Airport, ON (YYZ/CYYZ); 20 May 2007; (CC:by-nc-nd) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The Adamair flight went missing during a domestic flight to Manado. Last contact was at 14:07 when the flight was enroute at FL350. Initial reports indicate that the flight changed course twice as a result of severe (130 km/h) crosswind. The airplane crashed into the sea. On January 11 part of a jetliner's tail, food trays and other debris was pulled from the sea. On January 25 a U.S. navy ship detected signals coming from the flight recorder. The FDR was recovered from a depth of on 2000 m August 27. The CVR was recovered on August 28 from a depth of 1900 m. Investigators found that, during the flight from Surabaya to Manado, the Inertial Reference System (IRS) malfunctioned. Both pilots became engrossed with trouble shooting the IRS anomalies for at least the last 13 minutes of the flight, with minimal regard to other flight requirements. The pilots selected Attitude in the IRS, which disengaged the autopilot. After the autopilot disengaged and the aircraft rolled right and exceeded 35 degrees right bank, the pilots appeared to have become spatially disoriented. Control was lost and the airplane broke up and crashed into the sea. CAUSES:  1) Flight crew coordination was less than effective. The PIC did not manage the task sharing; crew resource management practices were not followed. 2) The crew focused their attention on trouble shooting the Inertial Reference System (IRS) failure and neither pilot was flying the aircraft. 3) After the autopilot disengaged and the aircraft exceeded 30 degrees right bank, the pilots appeared to have become spatially disoriented. 4) The AdamAir syllabus of pilot training did not cover complete or partial IRS failure. 5) The pilots had not received training in aircraft upset recovery, including spatial disorientation. OTHER CAUSAL FACTORS: 1) At the time of the accident, AdamAir had not resolved the airworthiness problems with the IRS that had been reoccurring on their Boeing 737 fleet for more than 3 months. 2) The AdamAir maintenance engineering supervision and oversight was not effective and did not ensure that repetitive defects were rectified.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSC Report number: KNKT/07.01/08.01.36 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   Confusion over missing Indonesian airplane (Int.

At 19:48, air traffic control cleared TW350 out of controlled airspace via the Sandy Bay runway 05 non-directional beacon approach. The crew flew the approach straight-in to runway 05 and initiated a go-around from the landing flare. The aircraft did not maintain a positive rate of climb during the go-around and collided with trees just beyond the departure end of the runway. All four occupants survived the impact and evacuated the aircraft. The captain died of his injuries before rescuers arrived. Both emergency medical technicians were seriously injured, and the first officer received minor injuries. The aircraft sustained substantial damage from impact forces and was subsequently destroyed by a post-impact fire. FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1. The crew was unable to work effectively as a team to avoid, trap, or mitigate errors and safely manage the risks associated with flight TW350. 2. Transwest Air (TWA) managers had identified and addressed some crew pairing issues with respect to this crew, but were unaware of the degree to which these factors could impair their effective crew coordination. 3. The crew's lack of coordination was, in part, because they had not received recent crew resource management (CRM) training. 4. Contrary to company policy, the approach to Sandy Bay, Saskatchewan, was flown by the less experienced crew member. 5. The crew members did not assess the aircraft performance and did not identify runway length as a threat. Consequently, they did not discuss and agree on a point at which a safe landing was no longer possible and were unprepared to make and execute a timely go-around decision. 6. The first officer suggested a go-around at an appropriate time. However, inadequate preparation and coordination by the crew members resulted in the captain rejecting this suggestion and they continued the approach past the point at which the aircraft could be safely stopped on the runway. 7. The captain decided to initiate a go-around, but his communication of this decision to the first officer was non-standard and did not have the desired effect of triggering the correct sequence of go-around actions required. 8. The captain very likely took control of the aircraft from the first officer using the non-standard transfer of control practice the crew had developed, thereby causing confusion, which further eroded the limited opportunity to achieve a positive climb. 9. The discrepancy in the standard operating procedures (SOPs) describing the selection of flaps during go-around likely led to both pilots independently operating the flap control lever, distracting them from monitoring the climb performance during the go-around. 10. It is likely that a somatogravic illusion caused the pilot flying (PF) to lower the nose of the aircraft. Consequently, the aircraft did not maintain a positive rate of climb and collided with the trees. 11. Deficiencies in TWA's supervisory activities permitted the undetected development and persistence of substantial and widespread deviations from SOPs within the King Air operation. 12. The company management structure and workload, combined with the location of managers away from the remote bases of operations, reduced the effectiveness of operational control.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A07C0001 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Flight PE905 departed Grande Prairie (CYQU) at 10:40 MST on the first leg of a scheduled run to Fort St. John (CYXJ), Fort Nelson, BC, and Grande Prairie.  Air traffic control (ATC) cleared the flight to maintain 12 000 feet above sea level (asl), and to hold on the TAYLOR non directional beacon (NDB), which forms the final approach fix for the instrument landing system (ILS) approach to runway 29 at St. John. At 11:09, Flight PE905 was cleared for an ILS approach to runway 29. The first approach was discontinued due to the aircraft being too high on the final approach leg, and clearance was given to return to the TAYLOR NDB at 6000 feet. At 11:23, ATC cleared the flight for another ILS approach to runway 29. The second approach was conducted as a full procedure with the outbound leg extended to ensure that the aircraft was positioned to follow the correct vertical approach profile. The final approach course was flown with a flap setting of 20Âº and at the company standard operating procedure (SOP) recommended airspeed of 130 knots. At approximately 300 feet above ground level, the first officer informed the captain that he had the ground in sight. The approach lights were visual shortly thereafter. The captain discontinued his instrument scan and confirmed the appearance of the approach lights. The captain made the decision to land, and called for the full flap setting of 35Âº. The first officer diverted his attention to setting flaps, and to the Vref reference cards clipped to the instrument panel. When he looked up, the aircraft was almost on the ground, but short of the runway. There was insufficient time to warn the captain. The aircraft initially touched down in a nearly wings-level attitude, 320 feet short of the threshold in about 16 inches of packed snow. The left main gear contacted the surface first, followed by the right main gear, and then the nose wheel. The aircraft then struck the last set of approach lights, bounced slightly, and touched down again 180 feet short of the threshold. After sliding through the threshold lights, the aircraft came to rest on the right edge of the runway, 380 feet beyond the threshold. The right main gear had broken off, and the nose gear had collapsed rearward. Both propellers were damaged by ground contact. The aircraft was equipped with a belly-mounted cargo pod, which supported the fuselage during impact. FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1. A late full flap selection at 300 feet above ground level (agl) likely destabilized the aircraft's pitch attitude, descent rate and speed in the critical final stage of the precision approach, resulting in an increased descent rate before reaching the runway threshold. 2. After the approach lights were sighted at low altitude, both pilots discontinued monitoring of instruments including the glide slope indicator. A significant deviation below the optimum glide slope in low visibility went unnoticed by the crew until the aircraft descended into the approach lights. FINDING AS TO RISK: 1. The crew rounded the decision height (DH) figure for the instrument landing system (ILS) approach downward, and did not apply a cold temperature correction factor. The combined error could have resulted in a descent of 74 feet below the DH on an ILS approach to minimums, with a risk of undershoot. OTHER FINDING: 1. The cockpit voice recorder (CVR) was returned to service following an intelligibility test that indicated that the first officer's hot boom microphone intercom channel did not record. Although the first officer voice was recorded by other means, a potential existed for loss of information, which was key to the investigation.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: TSB Report A07W0005 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: TSB   Location  Images: photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Calgary International Airport, AB (YYC/CYYC); 19 July 1994 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft departed from Balikpapan at 23:00 UTC with a planned flight time of 55 minutes at an altitude of 7000 feet. There were 13 people on board; two pilots, a maintenance engineer, and 10 passengers. The pilot in command (PIC) was the pilot flying for the sector to Tanjung Bara, and the copilot was the monitoring pilot. The flight was normal until 5 minutes before landing when the number 1 (left engine) generator malfunctioned. The pilot in command (PIC) asked the maintenance engineer on board the aircraft, who advised that there was no problem for the aircraft operations. The aircraft made its final approach to runway 04 at Tanjung Bara at 23:50. The aircraft touched down to the right of the centreline, then diverged right into soft wet ground, impacting a channel embankment and subsequently a barbed-wire airport perimeter fence. The investigation determined that aircraft was not being flown on a stabilized approach and subsequently touched down to the right of the runway centerline. It then veered to the right of centerline after touchdown and the PICs effort to bring the aircraft back to the runway centreline by using aileron was ineffective. There was no evidence that visibility affecting visual acquisition of the runway was a factor. However, the investigation considered that a visual approach guidance system such as Visual Approach System Indication (VASI), may have provided additional visual cues to alert the pilots to the prevent the unstabilized approach. Causes: 1. The pilot in command (PIC) continued to land the aircraft from an unstabilized approach. 2. The PIC did not maintain effective and appropriate control of the aircraft on the ground.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSC Report number: KNKT/07.01.03.04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  26 January 2008 PK-VSE Dirgantara Air Services 3 6,3 km Se of Long Apung Airport (LPU) w/o CFIT Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airportâs ground service company was requested to send a special vehicle to embark passengers with reduced mobility. At 15:30, with some 30 passengers already aboard the aircraft, three female passengers were atop the vehicleâs front platform, along with the driver, who was responsible for raising and lowering the platform, and an assistant who was helping the passengers board the airplane. At that moment the frame that held the platform to the truck broke loose from its upper horizontal and lateral braces (Figure 1), leaving a gap between the platform and the aircraft through which the three passengers fell, resulting in serious injuries to two and slight injuries to the third. The operators were able to hold on to the side rails, and one of them was even able to briefly hold on to the passenger who ended up being slightly injured.

Onboard the aircraft were 40 passengers and a crew of 4. On the two previous flights, there had been problems with extending the flaps before landing, first in Paris and then in Valladolid, where the aircraft had to land with the flaps retracted. During the ground tests performed by the crew in Valladolid, the flaps extended and retracted normally, and so the captain decided to continue with the flights as scheduled. During the flight, the crew went over the abnormal procedures to be followed in case of a repeat failure of the flaps system. After taking off from Valladolid, the flaps were retracted normally and remained retracted during the cruise and descent phases until the initial approach to Barcelona, at which time they failed to extend to the 8-degree position when commanded, resulting in a ""flap fail"" warning on the EICAS (Engine Indication and Crew Alerting System). The copilot noted the discrepancy between the commanded 8Â° position on the flaps lever and the 0Â° indicated position. At that time they were below the clouds and under ATC radar control. In the zero-flaps configuration, the ILS approach speed, in accordance with the relevant procedure, had to be maintained above 180 kt. ATC cleared them for the runway 25R approach and informed of a moderate intensity crosswind of 14 kt from 320Â°. The aircraft descended until it touched down at an IAS of 172 kt, at which time the crew realized they had not lowered the landing gear. After a long slide on the runway, the aircraft stopped 240 m before the end of the runway. There was no fire, though high temperatures and kerosene leaks were detected. A firefighting vehicle that was on the tarmac immediately reported to the scene, and sprayed the part of the aircraft in contact with the ground with fire retardant foam. The aircraft, which was stranded in the middle of the runway, was evacuated using the two front doors 1L and 1R, and the 2R overwing exit. The emergency window on the left side was not opened. Two passengers were slightly bruised during the evacuation. The remaining occupants were not injured. CAUSES: ""It is considered that the omission to actuate the landing gear extension lever, before touchdown, was the direct cause of the accident. Consequently, a belly landing in a gear-up configuration followed. A contributing factor was the presence of certain technical anomalies in the operation of the flaps system which detracted from the attention of the crew.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIAIAC Report number: A-003/2007 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Hawaii Island Air, d.b.a. Island Air, was operating the airplane as a positioning flight under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 91.  The airline transport pilot licensed captain, first officer, one flight attendant, and two deadheading pilot crew members were not injured; one deadheading pilot sustained serious injuries.  The airplane was not damaged.  The cross-country repositioning flight departed Honolulu, Hawaii, about 1515, with a planned destination of Kahului, Hawaii.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan had been filed.  The approximate global positioning system (GPS) coordinates of the event were 21 degrees 09.02 minutes north latitude and 157 degrees 05.8 minutes west longitude.The airplane encountered severe turbulence during an en route descent and a captain who was deadheading was not secured in his seat and received serious injuries.  The airplane was being positioned to another airport, and had a deadheading flight crew on board.  Prior to the descent, the captain noted an airspeed anomaly for the existing power setting.  He also observed that the flap indicator showed a ""slight"" deployment of the flaps.  He requested that the deadheading captain look out a cabin window, and verify the flap position.  The deadheading captain reported to the flying captain that the flaps were in the fully retracted position.  About this time, ATC personnel requested that a descent be initiated, which the flight crew initiated by reducing the power to slow down the airplane.  As the deadheading captain was making his way back to his cabin seat, the airplane encountered severe turbulence, which lasted about 5 to 10 seconds.  He was thrown about the cabin and injured.  The flying captain declared an emergency.  The flight landed without incident, and taxied to the gate where the injured crewmember was transported to the hospital.  A review was conducted of the ATC air-ground recordings between Maui approach control (APCON), two other airplanes flying in the area, and the accident airplane (Moku 979).  Prior to Moku 979 checking in with Maui approach, the two other airplanes reported moderate turbulence at 4,000 feet, and moderate to occasional severe turbulence between 2,000 and 2,500 feet.  Both airplanes were about 15 miles east of Maui, in the general vicinity of the accident airplane.  The controller contacted FSS, and advised them of the PIREP's.  About 75 seconds later, Moku 979 reported in to the approach control.  The controller told them to ""expect lower in 5 miles.""  The controller did not advise Moku 979 of the reported turbulence in the area.  Ninety-five seconds later the controller instructed Moku 979 to begin a descent to 1,500 feet.

Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The flight crew reported they depressurized the airplane after a cracked/shattered windshield. They then donned their oxygen masks but were unable to obtain oxygen from the oxygen system resulting in their loss of consciousness. They later regained consciousness, recovered from the descent, and landed without further incident at Cape Girardeau Regional Airport, Cape Girardeau, Missouri. The 14 CFR Part 91 business flight was operating on an instrument flight rules plan. The pilot and copilot were uninjured. The flight originated from Rogers Municipal Airport-Carter Field (ROG), Rogers, Arkansas, at 0839. The business flight was a positioning flight with no passengers aboard. The pilot had the copilot accompany him on the positioning flight so that the copilot could accumulate flight time. The copilot was not a company pilot and had not attended or completed an initial/recurrent training course for the airplane or received a checkout in the airplane. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The company pilot's poor judgment before and during the flight, including turning the oxygen system ready switch to the OFF position after he conducted the preflight inspection and using an unapproved checklist, which did not provide guidance for a fractured windshield and resulted in his depressurizing the airplane.""  Members Hersman and Sumwalt did not approve this probable cause. Member Hersman filed a dissenting statement, with which Member Sumwalt concurred. Hersman stated that the fracturing of the windshield should be cited as a contributing cause of this accident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CHI07LA063 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Cape Girardeau Airport, MO (CGI/KCGI); February 2007; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Cape Girardeau Airport, MO (CGI/KCGI); February 2007; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Cape Girardeau Airport, MO (CGI/KCGI); February 2007; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Cape Girardeau Airport, MO (CGI/KCGI); February 2007; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

On board were one pilot and five passengers. The pilot received fatal injuries in the accident; the passengers mostly suffered serious injuries. Weather conditions at the time were good, but it was after nightfall; the moon had not risen and there was little cultural lighting in the area. The aircraft crashed into a shallow lagoon approximately one nautical mile south-east of North Caicos Airport. Wreckage was spread along a trail that extended in excess of 370 m along a track of 220Â°(M). The aircraft's fuselage had come to rest comparatively intact, although lying in an inverted attitude. Evidence from the accident site indicated that the aircraft had struck the water in a nominally upright attitude, with only a moderate rate of descent but at relatively high forward speed. From a detailed examination of the wreckage and the circumstances of the accident, it was concluded that the aircraft was structurally intact and probably under control when it struck the surface. The evidence indicated that each engine was producing power throughout the short flight and at the time of impact. Although anomalies were found which suggested that a possible power asymmetry may have existed, this should not have been sufficient to cause the pilot serious control difficulties. None of the passengers described an obvious problem with the aircraft during the flight, and most remained unaware of the impending crash. The circumstances of the accident suggested that the pilot became spatially disorientated, to the extent that the aircraft diverged from its intended flight path and reached an irrecoverable situation. The environmental conditions were conducive to a disorientation event, and a postmortem toxicological examination showed that the pilot had a level of blood alcohol which, although below the prescribed limit, was significant in terms of piloting an aircraft and would have made him more prone to disorientation. The evidence indicated that the pilot had probably started a recovery to normal flight, but too late to prevent the accident. However, his actions had the effect of reducing the descent rate and placing the aircraft in a nearly level attitude at impact. This lessened the impact damage and helped preserve the fuselage structure relatively intact, increasing the passengers' chance of survival. The investigation identified the following causal factors: 1. The aircraft adopted an excessive degree of right bank soon after takeoff. This led to a descending, turning flight path which persisted until the aircraft was too low to make a safe recovery. 2. The pilot probably became spatially disorientated and was unable to recognise or correct the situation in time to prevent the accident. Contributory factors: 1. The environmental conditions were conducive to a spatial disorientation event. 2. The pilot had probably consumed alcohol prior to the flight, which made him more prone to becoming disorientated.  3. The flight was operated single-pilot when two pilots were required under applicable regulations.  The presence of a second pilot would have provided a significant measure of protection against the effects of the flying pilot becoming disorientated.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: 2/2010 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) AAIB; near North Caicos Airport (NCA); February 2007 photo (c) AAIB Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane sustained substantial damage and the three occupants, an airline transport pilot, flight paramedic and flight nurse, were killed. The Emergency Medical Services (EMS) positioning flight departed Great Falls International Airport, MT (GTF), at 20:40. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the departure airport and dark night visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the destination airport. The airplane was approximately 42 nautical miles from the tower-controlled destination airport, when the pilot was cleared for the visual approach. The flight did not arrive at the airport and reports were received that it had crashed. The wreckage was located later that evening approximately 80 feet below the peak of a ridge that rose to an elevation of approximately 5,700 feet.  The airport is located in a large valley and is surrounded by rising mountainous terrain. At night, clouds and terrain are difficult for pilots to see, and a gradual loss of visual cues can occur as flight is continued toward darker terrain. Additionally, the horizon is less visible and less distinct at night than during the day. Because the pilot was descending the airplane over rural, mountainous terrain that provided few visual ground reference cues, and because the overcast cloud layer would have prevented moonlight from illuminating the terrain, it is likely that the pilot did not see the rising terrain as the airplane continued toward it. The airplane was equipped with an Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System; however, impact damage to the unit precluded post accident testing. It is not known how the unit was configured during the flight or what type of alerts the pilot received prior to impact. Post accident examination of the wreckage, to include both engines, did not disclose evidence of a mechanical malfunction prior to impact. Additionally, no evidence was found to suggest an in-flight structural failure.

Weather at the TLZ was good, with a visibility of 25 km, no significant cloud and a light surface wind. The flight to the TLZ was routine and at approx 17:00 UTC the Hercules began to make its approach to the TLZ. Comms had already been established between ZH876 and the Tactical Air Traffic Controller (Tac ATC) at the TLZ, and the aircraft was subsequently cleared to land. An uneventful approach followed flown by the co-pilot. At 17:10:15 UTC, as the aircraft was about to touchdown at the TLZ, the crew experienced a load bang and a bright flash. The flash temporarily blinded the flight-deck crew. Virtually simultaneously, the aircraft touched down. The first flash was followed, a second later, by another flash and louder bang. The aircraft slewed off the left-hand side of the runway. The captain took over control of the aircraft. On regaining vision, the captain tried to steer the aircraft back onto the runway. However, the crew became aware of a fire on the port side, which was confirmed as a wing fire. The captain brought the aircraft to an immediate halt. The aircraft came to rest 50 m from the runway edge, some 700 m after touchdown.  The aircraft sustained substantial damage and it was decided to blow up the plane because the damage was too difficult to repair and there was also a potential risk that anti-Iraqi forces might obtain information on specialist equipment. CONCLUSIONS: ""The evidence recovered from the incident site revealed that two IED [improvised explosive device] arrays had exploded in the near vicinity of ZH876's touchdown point at the TLZ. The Board quickly ruled out aircraft systems failure and other possible causes. The Board concluded that this deliberate enemy action was the sole cause of the damage sustained to ZH876 in this incident.  The Board further concluded that there was a lack of understanding, by the Force Protection personnel, of TLZ sweep procedures and they had not received the appropriate training. This meant that the sweep procedures applied at the TLZ were inadequate to discover the IED arrays.""Accident investigation:   Report number: final reoport Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: Hercules plane destroyed in Iraq (BBC 13-2-2007)  Lyneham Herc kept out of enemy hands (Swindon Advertiser, 13-2-2007)  Military Aircraft Accident Summary (MAAS), Aircraft","Rolls-Royce AE2100D3",NA,"https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20070212-0"

At 14:30 hours the aircraft was rolled out of a heated hangar and towed to the apron of the Vnukovo-3 business terminal. At 15:57 the crew radioed a request to start the engines. This was allowed by ATC and the crew read back:  ""CK, start up approved and we will be ready in 10 to 15 minutes for taxi and take off due to deicing procedure"". At 16:01 the aircraft was towed to the anti-icing platform, where, at the request of the captain, it was processed in two stages by type I and type IV fluids. At 16:18 after the anti-icing treatment of the aircraft was completed, it was towed to the beginning of taxiway 14, where the engines were started. After working the necessary checklists the flight was cleared to taxi to runway 06 for departure. At 16:36 the flight was cleared for takeoff.  The airplane lifted off runway 06 about 1,500 meters from the threshold, and immediately banked sharply to the left. It then banked sharply to the right, hitting the runway with the right wingtip. The airplane continued to roll to the right until it was inverted, and veered off the right side of the runway. It came to rest 1,950 meters from the runway threshold, about 35 meters to the right of the runway's edge. PROBABLE CAUSE (translated from Russian): The accident with the aircraft CRJ100-SE registration number N168CK occurred as a result of loss of the lifting properties of the wing during the take-off phase, which led to the stalling of the aircraft immediately after detachment from the runway, collision of the right wing tip with the surface of the runway, subsequent destruction and fire.  The reason for the loss of the bearing properties of the wing under the actual meteorological conditions (moderate to strong rainfall, temperature minus 6Â°C, dew point minus 7Â°C) was the effect of ground icing, despite the anti-icing treatment that could be caused by a combination of the following factors: - deficiencies in the guidance documents defining the procedure for de-icing aircraft in a two-stage procedure, which resulted in the possibility of a different interpretation of the requirements for the start of a 3-minute interval between the first and second stages of processing;  - non-receipt by the crew of meteorological documentation in full in preparation for the flight and, as a consequence, inability to correctly determine the protective action time of the LOA and failure to take measures to re-process the aircraft;  - violation of the airway route recommended by the AFM, and non-retention of the recommended 3-minute interval between the first and second stages of treatment; - lack of proper control by crew members and / or airline representatives for the completeness and quality of anti-icing treatment;  - non-inclusion by the crew of the PIC wing before take-off, which is a mandatory requirement of the AFM for the actual weather conditions.  The protuberance of the sealant on the upper and lower surfaces of the wing by an amount significantly exceeding the limitation of the current technical conditions, as well as the beginning of the nose wheel lift of the aircraft at a speed of 12 knots less than the recommended one, reduced the margin for the stall angle of attack. The existing procedural method for monitoring the aerodynamic surfaces of the aircraft before departure, along with the inefficiency at the take-off stage of the existing stall protection system, because of the increased sensitivity of the wing, even to a slight contamination of the leading edge, can not fully guarantee the prevention of such incidents in the future.METAR: 13:36 UTC / 16:36 local time: UUWW 131330Z 13005MPS 1000 R06/1000N SHSN VV003 M06/M07 Q1009 TEMPO 0700 +SHSN RMK 06511040 QBB100=wind 130 degrees at 10 kts, visibility 1000 m in snow showers with a 300 ft.vertical visibility, Temperature -6Â°C, Dewpoint -7Â°C,QNH 1009 hPaAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB id NYC07RA064   Location  Images: photo (c) albspotter; Frankfurt International Airport (FRA); 16 November 2006; (CC:by-nc) photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Frankfurt International Airport (FRA/EDDF); November 2006 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The DHC-8-400 had stopped short of the runway, at intersection Holding Position JA1, prior to taking off. The following Boeing 777 was cleared to Holding Position J1, at the beginning of the runway, which involved taxiing beyond JA1. The crew of the B777 were cautioned about the presence of the DHC-8 as they continued towards J1. As the B777 passed behind the DHC-8, its right wingtip struck the DHC-8âs rudder.  The B777 suffered minor scratching to its wingtip. The DHC-8âs rudder was damaged and required replacement. AAIB Analysis Whilst the crew of G-JEDR reported that they had stopped âon the lineâ at the holding position, analysis showed that if the aircraft had been stopped with its nose precisely above the relevant marking, and that AP-BGY had been following the taxiway centreline, the two aircraft would not have collided. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that G-JEDR had stopped a few metres short of the holding position, which was consistent with allowing the crew a view of the stop bar, as is normal aviation practice. The decision by the commander of AP-BGY to deviate slightly from the taxiway centreline, as he passed G-JEDR, was to increase what he considered would be a small miss-distance between the two aircraft. The method used by the GMC controller when directing departing aircraft for either full length or intersection departures, in order to present the Tower controller with opportunities to expedite the flow of traffic, was in accordance with normal ATC practice. Both controllers had expected AP-BGY to hold short of the link to JA1, until G-JEDR had moved forward. The clearances issued, for AP-BGY to taxi to J1, were correct. However, the cautions to the flight crew, which represented essential aerodrome information âto assist him [the pilot] in preventing collisions with parked aircraftâ, as described in MATs Part 1, were not understood by them as meaning that there was a risk of a collision if they taxied past G-JEDR.

The first officer was flying the airplane. The captain reported they were cleared for the ILS runway 24R approach. Approximately 10 minutes prior to landing, air traffic control changed the landing runway to runway 28. The captain stated they were informed that the runway visual range (RVR) was 6,000 feet and that the braking action was fair. Also, the glideslope for the ILS runway 28 approach was unusable at the time of the accident due to the snow. After passing the final approach fix, they were informed that the RVR had decreased to 2,000 feet. The captain had the approach lights in sight and at 50 feet above the ground, he had the runway in sight. The first officer then turned off the autopilot to land. At 30 feet above the ground the captain momentarily lost sight of the runway. He then regained sight of the runway and the airplane was landed. They encountered strong gusty winds during the landing flare and after touchdown they could barely see the runway lights and taxiway turn-offs. Despite the use of full reverse and braking, the airplane did not seem to slow down. The airplane traveled off the runway and into the snow covered grass and went partially through the fence before coming to a stop more than 150 feet past the end of the runway. Runway 28 is 6017 feet long. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the failure of the flight crew to execute a missed approach when visual cues for the runway were not distinct and identifiable. Contributing to the accident were (1) the crewÂs decision to descend to the instrument landing system decision height instead of the localizer (glideslope out) minimum descent altitude; (2) the first officerÂs long landing on a short contaminated runway and the crewÂs failure to use reverse thrust and braking to their maximum effectiveness; (3) the captainÂs fatigue, which affected his ability to effectively plan for and monitor the approach and landing; and (4) Shuttle AmericaÂs failure to administer an attendance policy that permitted flight crewmembers to call in as fatigued without fear of reprisals.""METAR: 20:17 UTC / 15:17 local time: KCLE 182017Z 33013G19KT 1/4SM +SN BKN003 BKN010 OVC015 M08/M11 A3003 RMK AO2 P000020:33 UTC / 15:33 local time: KCLE 182033Z 32013KT 1 1/2SM -SN SCT003 BKN011 OVC028 M08/M11 A3004 RMK AO2 P0000Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NTSB/AAR-08-01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   NTSB/AAR-08/01   Location  Images: photo (c) Chuck Slusarczyk Jr; Cleveland-Hopkins International Airport, OH (CLE/KCLE); 18 February 2007 photo (c) NTSB; Cleveland-Hopkins International Airport, OH (CLE/KCLE); February 2007; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Cleveland-Hopkins International Airport, OH (CLE/KCLE); February 2007; (publicdomain) photo (c) aeroprints.com; Rantoul, KS; 30 April 2013; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) aeroprints.com; Rantoul, KS; 30 April 2013; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The international air carrier flight was in cruise flight at the time of the accident.  The captain stated the flight ""encountered a brief (2-3 second) but very intense moderate-to-severe turbulence event"" at flight level 340.  He noted that continuous moderate turbulence continued for approximately 30 seconds, and periods of occasional-to-continuous moderate chop continued for about 10 minutes after the initial encounter.  He added that there were no returns on the weather radar, and no pilot reports or adverse ride reports received from air traffic control.  The fasten seat belt sign was on at the time of the encounter because the flight had encountered light chop after leveling off at cruise altitude.  He reported that the ride had been smooth for approximately 10 minutes prior to the turbulence event.  The injured flight attendant stated that she was working in the aft galley when the turbulence began.  She reported that she hit her head on the ceiling and landed on the galley floor with her leg bent under her.  The Flight Data Recorder (FDR) revealed that the airplane encountered a vertical acceleration ranging from 0.245 G to 1.246 G.  The data also indicated that the autopilot was engaged, and no pitch inputs were made from the cockpit at the time of the encounter.  Postaccident inspections did not reveal any damage to the airplane.

After the right generator came online an electrical failure occurred in the right main bus. The failure resulted in severe internal arcing and short circuits inside the two main power contactors of the right main bus. The heat generated during the failure resulted in the contactor casings becoming compromised, causing molten metal droplets to fall down onto the insulation blankets below. The insulation blankets ignited and a fire spread underneath a floor panel to the opposite electrical panel (P205), causing heat and fire damage to structure, cooling ducts and wiring. The flight crew responded to the bus failure and a burning smell by shutting down the right engine and taxiing to a nearby stand. The Airfield Fire Service attended the aircraft when it arrived on stand and entered the Main Equipment Centre where they discovered significant smoke but no fire. The passengers were evacuated uneventfully via steps. CAUSAL FACTORS: 1. An internal failure of the Right Generator Circuit Breaker or Right Bus Tie Breaker contactor on the P200 power panel inside the Main Equipment Centre resulted in severe internal arcing and short-circuits which melted the contactor casings. The root cause of contactor failure could not be determined. 2. The open base of the P200 power panel allowed molten metal droplets from the failed contactors to drop down onto the insulation blankets and ignite them. 3. The aircraftÂs electrical protection system was not designed to detect and rapidly remove power from a contactor suffering from severe internal arcing and short-circuits. 4. The contactors had internal design features that probably contributed to the uncontained failures.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: AAIB AAR 2/2009 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ  History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  13 December 1999 N786UA United Airlines 0 NW of London-Heathrow Airport (LHR/EGLL) non Turbulence 13 September 2023 N786UA United Airlines 0 30 nm W of Yarmouth, NS non Loss of pressurization Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight that had been initially planned for 26th February 2007, was postponed several times due to adverse meteorological conditions, causing problems with provision supply on Ruhnu island. On Friday, 3rd March, pilot checked the weather at 15:00 and at 16:00. Based on the received information the pilot decided to depart for Ruhnu at 16:00. At 16:08, the aircraft took off from PÃ¤rnu airport with a pilot, two passengers and 520 kg of cargo on board. According to the weather briefing received by the pilot via telephone from Kuressaare, at 16:00 the cloud height in Kuressaare (EEKE, 36 Nm northwest of Ruhnu) was 600 ft. and 180 m (approximately 540 ft.) in Ruhnu. During the uneventful flight on the altitude 1500 ft., the coast and the ice border were clearly visible. The aircraft stayed clear from the clouds and no signs of icing were noticed by persons on board. Approaching the island from the northeast it was intended by the pilot to use runway 32 for landing. The pilot decided to fly low from east to west across the runway to check the windsock and runway condition. While approaching the island, the pilot descended at the rate of 150 ft/min with low power settings and flaps extended by 1 notch. During descent the horizontal and vertical visibility deteriorated and the flight was continued in IMC. The descent was continued in clouds; therefore the pilot had no visual contact with the ground and horizon. The aircraft broke through the clouds over the coast at a very low altitude (100-120 feet). Trying to maintain safe altitude and speed pilot added power, at the same time stall warning signal activated and seconds later the lower part of aircraft's fuselage touched the treetops and collided with the terrain at 16:36.  The passengers and pilot escaped the aircraft without assistance and with no injuries. Causes of the accident: The investigation established the following causes of the accident: 1. The pilot could not maintain safe flight altitude when approaching Ruhnu aerodrome. 2. The pilot continued the descent in spite of IMC. Contributing factors to the accident The investigation established the following factors contributing to the accident: 1. High motivation to perform the flight. 2. Inadequate weather information from ground services of Ruhnu aerodrome. 3. Inadequate aeronautical oversight in the destination airport.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MinEcon Report number: EE030/030307 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 years and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Delfi  Images: photo (c) Karl KrÃ¤mer, via Werner Fischdick; Harle Airport (EDXP); August 2003 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Garuda flight 200 was an early morning service from Jakarta (CGK) to Yogyakarta (JOG). The pilot in command (PIC) was the pilot flying, and the copilot was the support/monitoring pilot. The PIC intended to make an instrument landing system (ILS) approach to runway 09 at Yogyakarta and briefed the copilot accordingly. Yogya Approach cleared the aircraft for a visual approach, with a requirement to proceed to long final and report runway in sight. Although the crew acknowledged the visual approach clearance, they continued with the ILS approach, but did not inform the controller. The descent and approach were conducted in visual meteorological conditions. At 07:55:33, when the aircraft was 10.1 miles from the runway, it was 1,427 feet above the initial fix of 2,500 feet published in the approach chart, and the airspeed was 283 knots. The pilot in command descended the aircraft steeply in an attempt to reach the runway, but in doing so, the airspeed increased excessively. As the aircraft was being flown at speeds that were in excess of the wing flaps operation speed, the copilot elected not to extend the flaps as instructed by the PIC. During the approach, the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) alerts and warnings sounded 15 times and the copilot called for the PIC to go around. The PIC continued the approach with flaps 5 degrees, and the aircraft attained the glideslope near the runway 09 threshold. Flaps 5 degrees is not a landing flap setting. The aircraft crossed the threshold, 89 feet above the runway, at an airspeed of 232 knots, 98 knots faster than the required landing speed for flaps 40 degrees. The wind was north easterly at 9 knots. The groundspeed was 235 knots. The aircraft touched down at an airspeed of 221 knots, 87 knots faster than landing speed for 40 degrees flap. Shortly after touching down, the copilot called, with high intonation, for the PIC to go around. The aircraft overran the departure end of runway 09, to the right of the centerline at 110 knots. The aircraft crossed a road, and impacted an embankment before stopping in a rice paddy field 252 meters from the threshold of runway 27 (departure end of runway 09). The aircraft destroyed by the impact forces and an intense, fuel-fed, post-impact fire. CAUSES:  ""1. Flight crew communication and coordination was less than effective after the aircraft passed 2,336 feet on descent after flap 1 was selected. Therefore the safety of the flight was compromized.  2. The PIC flew the aircraft at an excessively high airspeed and steep descent during the approach. The crew did not abort the approach when stabilized approach criteria were not met. 3. The pilot in command did not act on the 15 GPWS alerts and warnings, and the two calls from the copilot to go around. 4. The copilot did not follow company instructions and take control of the aircraft from the pilot in command when he saw that the pilot in command repeatedly ignored warnings to go around. 5. Garuda did not provide simulator training for its Boeing 737 flight crews covering vital actions and required responses to GPWS and EGPWS alerts and warnings such as ÂTOO LOW TERRAINÂ and ÂWHOOP, WHOOP PULL UPÂ.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSC Report number: KNKT.07.03.05.04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   KNKT  NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) I.

Two low passes were flown, at 500 feet over the runway. The crew then attempted to extend the nose landing gear by utilizing acceleration force during a steep turn. When this did not work, a touch-and-go was made so as to apply an impact to the nose landing gear. The flight crew when concluded that they had to make a landing with the nose gear retracted. The captain directed the cabin attendants to move some passengers to aft cabin and fire extinguishing agent was sprayed on the runway. At 10:54 a landing was carried out. The airplane sustained structural damage on the lower part of the forward fuselage. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""It is recognized that this accident was caused by that, in spite of gear down operations in flight by normal and alternative procedures, the nose landing gear could not be extended because the doors of the nose landing gear remained closed, and when the Aircraft landed in this configuration, the lower part of the forward fuselage contacted the runway surface and was damaged. It is recognized that the doors of the nose landing gear remained closed because the spacer migrated out from the hinge part of the toggle link assy, which was part of the nose landing gear door linkage mechanism, interfered with the support fitting, thereby prevented the movement of the toggle link assy, which resulted in restraining the movement of the entire nose landing gear door linkage mechanism. It is estimated that the spacer migrated out because the bolt, nut and the like were not installed, and the spacer was gradually pulled aft out of the toggle link assy under the influence of retractions/extensions of the nose landing gear, airframe vibration, aircraft acceleration and so on, during operations of the Aircraft. Regarding that the bolt, nut and the like were not installed, it is considered that these parts were not re-installed at the time of the repair in the manufacturing process of the Aircraft.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JTSB Report number: AA2008-5 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  17 March 2019 RA-67252 Aurora 0 Kupol Airport (KPX) non 8 July 2020 RA-67252 Aurora 0 Yuzhno-Kurilsk Mendeleyevo Airport non Taxiway excursion 8 January 2025 RA-67252 Aurora 0 near Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Airport (UUS/UHSS), Sakhalin Oblast non 22 February 2025 RA-67252 Aurora 0 near Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Airport (UUS/UHSS), Sakhalin Oblast non Bird strike Location  Images: photo (c) JTSB; Kochi Airport (KCZ/RJOK); March 2007 photo (c) JTSB; Kochi Airport (KCZ/RJOK); March 2007 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The captain reported that the landing lights illuminated the ducks and in less than a second the airplane struck the ducks. The left engine fan blade was struck by 3-5 ducks at the midspan shroud liberating the fan blade tip, which was contained.  The impact resulted in movement of the variable stator vanes and 2.5 bleed valves. The engine then made an uncommanded shutdown. The hydraulic pressure supply manifold broke due to high vibratory fatigue after the impact, which also resulted in minimizing the amount of fuel released into the engine nacelle. The airplane returned for landing at the departure airport without further incident.

Tambo International Airport (FAJS) to Durban International Airport (FADN) and arrived at FADN at 1915Z. According to the pilot, they used the aircraft's weather radar to help them avoid adverse weather during the descent to FADN. The radar operated satisfactorily during the descent and approach for landing. After landing at FADN, the aircraft was turned around in 45 minutes for the return flight SA6582 to FAJS. The crew taxied to runway 06, the active runway at the time, but just prior to take-off, ATC advised the pilot that a Boeing B737-800 had had to execute a go-round due to a tailwind component with the surface wind at 240/15kt. The pilot and co-pilot repositioned the aircraft and prepared to take off from runway 24. The fire crew reported that there was no standing water on the runway, although it was raining quite heavily. From their position at the threshold of runway 24, the pilot carefully scanned the area with the weather radar but this showed no returns. The Boeing B737-800 which approached from that direction supported the radar information that it was safe for take-off. After the co-pilot (pilot-flying) concurred with the pilot (pilot non-flying) that it was safe for take-off, they obtained take-off clearance from the ATC. Maximum thrust on both engines was selected and the aircraft climbed away steeply. As there were no radar returns indicated ahead or to the right of the aircraft, the co-pilot commenced the right-hand turn towards the Greytown VOR (GYV) at an IAS of 280 kts. The pilot and co-pilot individually checked that the weather radar settings were correct and adjusted the tilt, gain, range and stab settings but no green, yellow or red returns appeared on the radar. At 9 000ft AMSL, light hail was encountered and the crew selected the 'Engine Anti-Ice'? as well as the 'Low Ignition'? switches to the ON position. The hail seemed to lessen but shortly thereafter, it became much worse with the radar screen still remaining completely clear. The co-pilot then made a 30 degree turn to the right and the captain asked ATC if they had any weather returns on their radar, but due to the noise of the hail on the fuselage, ATC was unable to hear the transmission clearly. Some moderate turbulence was experienced which became severe in short bursts. At this stage, the captain and co-pilot had to communicate using hand signals. The captain scanned the radar in an attempt to find a clear path through the clouds and also monitored the co-pilot's flying. All engine parameters remained normal. The aircraft continued climbing in a north-easterly direction and at 15 000 ft AMSL, cleared the clouds and continued to its destination without further incident.  Probable Cause The aircraft encountered severe hail during climb-out after taking off from Durban International Airport. The aircraft's weather radar did not show any hail on the radar screen.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CAA S.A.

None of the four crewmembers or two passengers were injured. The air ambulance flight was flying a GPS runway 16 approach at Beverly (BVY). After passing the initial approach fix they entered a cloud, and noticed that there was ""quite a bit of wind"" which they had to compensate for. Moments later, the first officer noticed that they were picking up a trace amount of rime ice on the windscreen; however, since neither pilot saw any ice on the wings, the de-icing boots were never activated. As they neared the final approach fix (FAF), they ""added a notch"" of approach flaps, and then added full flaps when they crossed the FAF. After reaching the minimum descent altitude, they acquired the field and the visual approach slope indicator (VASI). Once established on the VASI, the approach to landing seemed normal until reaching approximately 100 feet above ground level. The crew then experienced what they described as a ""burble,"" and the airplane rolled ""steeply"" to the right, striking the surface of the runway overrun area. After landing and taxiing to the ramp, the flight crew conducted a postflight inspection of the airplane. They noted that approximately 4 feet of the right wing was bent upward about 10 degrees, and ""Light rime ice"" was present on the leading edges of the wings, horizontal stabilizer and radome. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The inadequate guidance and procedures provided by the airplane manufacturer regarding operation of the pneumatic de-icing boots.

Upon departure from Surgut, the weather at Samara was below minima with a visibility of 200 m in fog. An improvement was expected to a visibility of 3000 m upon arrival. The Tupolev Tu-134 took off at 04:08 UTC, climbing to the cruising altitude of 10600 m. En route weather reports showed an improvement to a visibility of 1500 m at Samara.  At 06:18 UTC (11:18 local time), shortly after contacting Samara Control, the captain briefed the crew about the arrival procedures for Samara. During the briefing he incorrectly stated that the altitude at which they would capture the glide slope was 500 m (the actual height is 400 m according to the approach charts). About 06:22, Samara Control cleared the flight to descend to 5400 m. During their descent, about 06:30, the ground wind at Samara Airport changed direction from west (270-290Â°) to southeast (120Â°) with fog again worsening the visibility. Samara Approach cleared the flight further down to 2400 m and reported of 1200 m with haze and fog. At 06:35 the crew received further clearances in preparation for an approach to runway 23 and the controller reported pressure at the airfield being 745 mm Hg. At 06:37 visibility dropped to 800 m. The meteorological station officer did not inform air traffic control, although he was aware of this significant drop in visibility. Shortly afterward a visibility of 608 m was registered, which was below airport landing minima. This value was not noted by the met station officer and thus not passed on to ATC. At 06:38:53 the flight reported at 400 m. The crew was then instructed to contact the Samara Landing controller, which they did. At 06:40 UCT air traffic control contacted the met station to inquire about the cloud base and horizontal visibility. The met officer reported fog with 800 m visibility but did not mention the cloud base. The cloud base according to the latest ATIS information was 490 m. The actual cloud base measured at the time of the approach was about 30 m. At 06:40:10, at a speed of 380 km/h, the flight engineer lowered the landing gear and the captain trimmed the stabilizer. At 06:40:43, at a speed of 350 km/h, the flaps were extended to 20 degrees. At the same time, the Tu-134 was 10 km on finals, the controller reported the (incorrect) visibility of ""800 m in fog"". At 06:41:09., 8 km out, at a speed of 320 km/h, the flaps were set at 30 degrees.  At 06:41:45 the airplane passed the Outer Marker at 200 m. The navigator failed to inform the crew that they had passed the Outer Marker. Thus the pilot did not inform the controller, in order to obtain landing clearance. When the controller inquired about their position, the crew reported ready for landing. At 06:41:55 they were cleared to land. The vertical rate of descent was 6 m/s, which exceeded the recommended rate of descent. The aircraft passed the Inner Marker at a height of 60 m, and a vertical rate of descent of 5,5 m/s with a lateral deviation from the runway axis to the right, no less than 40 m with a further tendency to the right. At decision height the crew had not established positive visual contact with the approach lights. The approach was continued until the airplane contacted the ground, at 06:42:33, 300 m short of the runway and 100 m to the right of the extended centreline. The left wing separated from the fuselage and the plane rolled on its back. The Technical Commission came to the following conclusion: The reason for the crash of TU-134A RA-65021 during the approach to landing at Kurumoch Airport, Samara, in weather conditions significantly below minima for the airport, aircraft, and crew, was the destruction of the aircraft during its travel over the ground after a hard touchdown 300 meters short of the runway and 100 meters to the right of the approach course. The accident resulted from organizational, technical, and procedural deficiencies in the work and interaction of the weather and air traffic control services, as well as from crew errors. Deficiencies in the standards and technical documentation of the Samara Airport made it impossible for Air Traffic Control to inform the crew on a timely basis of the readings from the KRAMS-4 weather station, which indicated a deterioration of weather conditions below airport minima. At decision height, in the absence of reliable visual contact with the approach lights and airport environment, the flight crew did not make a timely decision to execute a missed approach. The air traffic controllerÂs failure to use the full capability of the radar equipment because of contradictions in the relevant standards and procedures documents, as well as poor coordination among the flight crew and their delay in executing a missed approach, made it impossible to avoid a tragedy. The lack of unified federal regulations covering flight operations, Air Traffic Control, and weather and other services, taking into account both domestic and international experience in flight safety, contributed to this aviation accident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: ITAR-TASS  MAK Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC)   Location  Images: photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Praha-Ruzyne International Airport (PRG/LKPR); June 1999 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The crew reported the en route portion of the flight was uneventful. As the airplane approached RIL, the crew checked the automated surface observing system (ASOS) report which reported the sky overcast at 4,000 feet and no rain. During the downwind leg to runway 26, the crew could see the runway. Prior to the final approach fix for the ILS approach to runway 26 and approximately 8 miles from the airport, the crew had the runway in sight. The crew communicated their intentions on the RIL common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF). The pilot flew the airplane on the glideslope approximately Vref (Final Approach Speed) 128 knots plus 10-15 knots, then below 1,000 feet, Vref plus 10 knots. The pilot stated that the airplane touched down approximately 1,500 feet from the approach end of runway 26. The co-pilot reported the airbrake was in the #2 position and they had ""good anti-skid indication"" after touchdown. The pilot ""began braking, deployed the thrust reverser, and continued to increase brake pressure as it didn't seem like a normal deceleration rate. With approximately 2,500 feet of runway remaining, the airplane continued to not decelerate normally, and the pilot knew they did not have enough runway to execute a go-around. With approximately 1,000 feet of runway remaining, the pilot pulled the parking brake to the second detent, and the aircraft slid off the end of the runway into the dirt and muddy terrain. It came to rest 268 feet past the runway end. The right main landing gear trunnion had sheared from its attach points, rotated up and punctured wing skin. The main landing gear strut impacted the aft spar and sheared rib 3, which compromised the wing fuel tank. The forward main landing gear trunnion exited the forward trunnion bore, and the aft spar was fractured.

The airplane received substantial damage. One passenger received minor injuries.  The flight originated from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, at 12:55.  The flight crew was in cruise flight when a master caution light illuminated indicating a loss of the right hydraulic system pressure and hydraulic fluid. The crew used the checklist to trouble shoot the system and attempted to manually extend the main and nose landing gear (NLG) using the alternate extension control lever. Both main gear extended and locked into place; however the NLG did not extend. The airplane was landed with the NLG in the retracted position. Initial inspection of the airplane revealed that a B-nut to the check valve on the rudder power hydraulic shut off valve, was separated from the valve resulting in a total loss of right hydraulic quantity and pressure. Examination of the hydraulic tube, including the B-nut and check valve, did not reveal any abnormalities. Examination of the cockpit revealed the landing gear handle was in the stowed position. A placard on the alternate landing gear extension lever stated, ""Pull up forcibly Full Stroke."" The airplane was placed on jacks and maintenance personnel successfully extended the nose landing gear. The alternate gear extension control system was also inspected and no defects were noted.

CONCLUSION The cause of the accident during the engine start-up process was the displacement of the aircraft forward and toward the left due to a higher power setting in the engines of the right wing, which caused the No. 3 engine to strike the ground power unit that was positioned in front of the right wing. It was a series of events that contributed to the incident: a) The removal of chocks by ground personnel without having taken them as a precaution and safety measure first, which led to the decision to move the ground power unit that was in front of the right wing of the aircraft. b) Not using ground-to-cabin communication headsets between the cabin crew and the ground technical staff. c) Failing to provide a training course to the ground staff by PHOENIX to GIRAG on the operational procedures on the ground for their aircraft. d) Not taking immediate precautions by the crew concerning the limits that the aircraft had when it lost hydraulic pressure. e) Not ensuring that the parking brakes were set and engaged. f) Not operating the air emergency brake lever by the crew members (Captain or Co-pilot) when they noticed that the aircraft started moving forward for no apparent reason, despite having two levers, one in front of each crew member.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAC El Salvador Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: https://portal.aeronautica.gob.pa/upia/archivo/54245_XA-AEG_-29.08.2024_informe_final.pdf Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates18-Jan-2025 17:29 ASN Updated [Time, Source, Damage, Narrative, Accident report, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight was due to land at Hoskins and Rabaul. An area forecast for the flight indicated that there were areas of rain and scattered cloud from 1500-5000 feet with deteriorating conditions forecast for the period between 0400-0800 hours. Last radio contact with the flight was at 05:06 when the crew advised Port Moresby Flight Service that they were overhead Maran. The airplane was declared missing when it failed to arrive at Hoskins and the wreckage was located later that day in a wooded area at an elevation of 238 m. An investigation revealed that the right engine had been shut down and the fire extinguisher for the engine had been activated. However, there was no evidence of in-flight fire in the engine. The airplane descended below the en-route lowest safe altitude of 8,300 feet. At some point the undercarriage was extended. In total darkness, at 05:23, the airplane struck tree tops on gentle sloping terrain. The right wing broke off and the aircraft slid for another 300 m before coming to rest.

The airplane was near the eastern shore of Lake Michigan, about 35 miles west-northwest of Grand Rapids, Michigan, when the accident occurred.  The flight crew received a left thrust reverser unlock indication while holding for takeoff. The captain cycled the reverser, and had decided to return to the gate when the messages cleared. With the issue apparently resolved, he elected to takeoff. The captain reported experiencing a small vibration on climb out and, a short time later, he heard a ""loud bang"" and the ""aircraft pitched and yawed/rolled to [the] left."" The autopilot disengaged and the left thrust lever moved to idle during the event. The first officer ran the checklist to stow the reverser. The captain decided to continue to the intended destination because the thrust reverser messages had cleared and the vibrations had stopped. The flight subsequently landed uneventfully. The flight data recorder (FDR) indicated that the left engine vibration levels were elevated during the accident flight. Approximately 3 minutes into the flight, the left engine thrust reverser unlocked parameter changed to ""On"" for about 1 second. About 11 minutes and 20 seconds after takeoff, the left engine vibration level increased momentarily, and both the left and right engine speeds and fuel flows began to decrease. As the decrease in fuel flows was occurring, the airplane rolled right, left, and right again over about a 4-second period. The decrease in engine parameters lasted over 3 minutes before returning to normal. The left engine thrust reverser unlock parameter indicated ""On"" for about 4 seconds during that time. The left engine vibration levels decreased after the event, below the levels previously recorded during the flight, and approximately to the level of the right engine vibration. The vibration and engine speed variations suggested separation of the left engine translating cowling at that point. The left engine thrust reverser deploy parameter remained in the ""Off"" state for the entire flight. Additionally, the FDR data revealed that the left engine vibration levels were elevated and left engine thrust reverser did not deploy on the two previous flights. The post accident inspection revealed that the left engine translating cowl had separated from the engine assembly and damaged the empennage. Damage to the thrust reverser components was consistent with prior operation with the reverser out of alignment and jamming of the translating structure. In-flight separation of the left engine thrust reverser translating cowling due to intermittent binding and jamming of the reverser on the accident flight and on previous flights. Contributing factors were the inadequate maintenance action by the operator due to their failure to properly resolve the prior reverser malfunctions, the failure of the pilots of previous flights in not referring earlier reverser deployment failures for maintenance action, and incomplete company/manufacturer's procedures because they did not address anomalous reverser indications during ground operations.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CHI07FA107 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot contacted air traffic services and requested further assistance from company engineering personnel to visually assess the extension state of the landing gear. Two aerodrome passes were completed throughout the troubleshooting exercise and the pilot remained in radio contact with both groups during this phase.  Following the flyovers and after holding over Rottnest Island at 5,000 ft for a period of approximately two hours, the pilot flew the King Air back to Perth airport.  With the gear still jammed in the partially retracted position, both the left and right main landing gear assemblies collapsed after the aircraft touched down on runway 24. The aircraft was substantially damaged as a result of the collapse. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau investigation revealed that two major system components had failed which could have prevented the landing gear from properly retracting/extending; the geared components within the right main landing gear actuator had fractured, and the left torque tube support bearing had seized from contamination and lack of lubrication. Although each component failure was apparently unrelated, the examination was not able to conclusively establish which failure had been the primary contributing factor in this landing occurrence. The Super King Air 200 aircraft landing gear system configuration was such that should either one of these component assemblies cease to function, extension or retraction of the landing gear would not have been possible.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ATSB Report number: 200702171 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: ATSB History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  18 January 2005 VH-SGT Network Aviation Australia 0 Perth Airport, WA (PER) sub Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

After the landing gear was in up-position, the vibration disappeared. The flight crew continued the flight normally to the destination. During flight, the flight crew was notified by another company aircraft departed after GA602, that they observed tire debris left on the runway. There was no abnormality during cruise.   During approach briefing, the PIC also  briefed the possibility of landing with one tire has burst. Although landing at maximum landing weight was permitted, the PIC requested a 30 minutes holding to the ATC in order to reduce landing weight.   During visual approach to runway 13, the flight  crew requested to the Hasanuddin Tower for over-flying at an altitude of 400 feet, to verify the main landing gear tires condition.

Automatic weather observation data indicated at 00:30, the visibility was one-half mile in snow, with indefinite ceiling and vertical visibility of 200 feet. Snow removal operations were in progress at the airport, and the flight crew communicated directly with airport operations regarding the runway conditions. After landing, the airplane overran the departure end of runway 28, which is 6,501 feet long, with an additional 200 feet of pavement.

This poor decision-making likely reflected the effects of fatigue produced by a long, demanding duty day; and, for the captain, the duties associated with check airman functions. Contributing to the accident were 1) the Federal Aviation Administration pilot flight and duty time regulations that permitted the pilotsÂ long, demanding duty day and 2) the TVC operations supervisorÂs use of ambiguous and unspecific radio phraseology in providing runway braking information.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NTSB/AAR-08-02 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   NTSB press release April 24, 2007  Pinnacle Airlines Flight 4712 (Pinnacle Airlines news release 12-4-2007)   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Traverse City Airport, MI (TVC/KTVC); 12 April 2007; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The captain advised the flight attendants to have the cabin secured and be in their seats within 15 minutes.  The first officer gave the 'prepare for landing' announcement in the descent around flight level FL250 (25,000 feet), which was after the captain had notified the flight attendants to prepare the cabin, but before the end of the stated 15 minutes.  While descending through 15,500 feet, the airplane experienced a moderate 'jolt' lasting 1-2 seconds.  By this time it had been more than 15 minutes since the captain gave the flight attendants the secure cabin instructions.  The cabin crew reported injuries to all flight attendants and no injuries to passengers.  All six flight attendants received medical attention after landing.  One flight attendant was seriously injured with a closed fibular fracture; the five other flight attendants had minor injuries.  The first officer said that turbulence during their departure had been very bad, therefore, in order to mitigate any passenger anxiety, when he made the 'prepare for landing' announcement, he added that the turbulence would not be as bad as it was on departure.  He understood the captain's instructions to the flight attendants, and this announcement was aimed solely at the passengers. The flight attendants confirmed that they understood the captain's instructions to have the cabin cleaned up and be seated within 15 minutes.  As they were finishing the cabin clean up, the first officer's 'prepare for landing' announcement indicated that the turbulence would not be as bad as they had been told to expect.  The flight attendants may have interpreted this added information concerning turbulence as a relaxation of the captain's earlier instructions.  The Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR) indicated the turbulence occurred as the aircraft was coming out of a 12-degree right bank and descending through 15,400 pressure altitude.  The event lasted approximately 10-11 seconds.  The bank angle of the aircraft was between 8 and 1 degrees right wing down during the event.  Vertical acceleration fluctuated between .5 and 2.06 G's.  Longitudinal acceleration spiked up to .2 G's about the same time as the 2 G vertical spike.  Lateral acceleration fluctuated between .1 G left and .05 G's to the right during the incident.  The data showed that the autopilot was engaged and in control of the aircraft during the incident. Probable Cause: The flight's encounter with a turbulence event that occurred while the flight attendants were unseated.  Contributing to the accident was the apparent conflicting information provided by the flight deck to the flight attendants and the flight attendants' interpretation of that information.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: LAX07LA127 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB LAX07LA127  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates25-Mar-2024 08:44 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

At the same time, the two people assigned to the push-back vehicle were busy disconnecting the towbar connected to the aircraft. A mechanic, in contact with the pilot by wire, removed the steering lock pin. At this point, the Ground controller authorised the crew to taxi behind a B 777. They started taxiing while the push-back vehicle and the three people were still under the aircraft. A few seconds later, engine number 3 hit the pushback vehicle, which was dragged for about twenty metres. The three people on the ground moved away from the area. The aircraft was flown to Tel Aviv on April 16 and resumed regular service on April 18. CONCLUSION Taxiing was started without the procedures for ensuring that the safety zone had been cleared having been applied.

The fire was probably caused by either an electrical spark, or arc from a faulty light, or by an electrostatic discharge from paint spraying equipment while the aircraft was in interior painting works. Contributory factors: (i) The painting process could have generated a layer of flammable vapor close to the cabin floor which may have led to creating flammable vapor pockets under the polythene sheets. (ii) The spread of the fire was probably exacerbated by the lack of fire extinguishers and the quantity of used paint cans, rags, polythene sheets and chemicals existent in the aircraft.

All 108 passengers and six crew members were killed in the accident. The airplane was operated by Kenya Airways as flight KQ507 from Abidjan Airport (ABJ), Ivory Coast to Nairobi (NBO), Kenya via Douala (DLA), Cameroon. The flight from Abidjan to Douala was reportedly conducted without incident.  The flight arrived about 22:00 hours local time, May 4. The scheduled departure time of 23:00 was delayed due to weather which consisted of thunderstorms with heavy rain showers. When the weather improved, flight 507 taxied to runway 12. The aircraft took off and climbed into the dark night. There were no external visual references, yet no instrument scanning was done by the crew. At 1000 feet climbing, the pilot flying released the flight controls for 55 seconds without having engaged the autopilot. The bank angle of the airplane increased continuously by itself very slowly up to 34 degrees right and the captain appeared unaware of the airplaneÂs changing attitude. Just before the ""Bank Angle"" warning sounds, the captain grabbed the controls, appeared confused about the attitude of the airplane, and made corrections in an erratic manner increasing the bank angle to 50 degrees right. At about 50 degrees bank angle, the autopilot was engaged and the inclination tended to stabilize; then movements of the flight controls by the pilot resumed and the bank angle increased towards 70 degrees right. A prolonged right rudder input brought the bank angle to beyond 90 degrees. The airplane descended in a spiral dive and crashed into a mangrove swamp. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The airplane crashed after loss of control by the crew as a result of spatial disorientation (non recognized or subtle type transitioning to recognized spatial disorientation), after a long slow roll, during which no instrument scanning was done, and in the absence of external visual references in a dark night.  Inadequate operational control, lack of crew coordination, coupled with the non-adherence to procedures of flight monitoring, confusion in the utilization of the AP, have also contributed to cause this situation.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CCAA Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Kenya Airways press release  Kenya Airways plane crashes in Cameroon: radio (AP, 5-5-2007)  Reconstructing the last moments of Kenya Airways Flight 507 (AP, 12-5-2007)  Cameroon Civil Aviation Authority press release   Location  Images: photo (c) Tom Lo; London-Heathrow Airport (LHR/EGLL); 29 October 2006 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight crew donned their oxygen masks and diverted to the closest airport in point of time, and landed uneventfully. Postflight inspection of the accident airplane revealed a 12-inch by 5-inch fuselage skin tear, approximately 6 feet forward of the forward cargo door. During the course of the investigation it was revealed that at some point during the aircraft luggage off-loading or loading process, the engine of the belt loader quit operating. The senior of three ground agents working the flight decided to move the belt loader away from the airplane by pushing the belt loader with a luggage tug; however, during the attempt to move the belt loader, the tugâs cab contacted the fuselage.

The pilot, the sole occupant in the airplane, was not injured. The pilot was flying on an activated instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan, which had an intended destination of Kalispell, Montana. The pilot said that he had departed from Billings, Montana, and had climbed to 12,000 feet. About 40 nautical miles northwest of Billings, he heard a ""clunk"" and the red unsafe light in the gear handle came on. He verified that all systems were functioning normally, and he cycled the landing gear up and down to see if that would solve the problem. The unsafe light remained illuminated. The pilot returned to Billings and circled for several hours to burn his fuel load down. He said that at one point he flew low over the runway so the company mechanic, with the aid of a light from an airport vehicle, could visually check the nose gear position. It was hanging out of the wheel well at approximately a 45-degree angle. Upon landing at Billings, the airplane settled to its nose during landing rollout.  Examination of the airplane by an FAA inspector revealed that the nose gear actuator mount bracket area was bent and wrinkled. The nose gear actuator shaft had fractured just above the clevis bolt, which attaches to the drag brace. The failed actuator had been installed on July 26, 2006. The Beech B99 maintenance manual states that the hydraulic actuator needs to be overhauled or replaced every 10,000 hours; maintenance records indicate that this one had 231.4 hours on it at the time of the accident. Metallurgists from both the National Transportation Safety Board and Hawker Beechcraft Corporation examined the failed actuator. Both concluded that all of the fractures were overstress, and no preexisting fatigue signatures were evident.

There were no injuries to any crew or passengers.  Flight 8911 departed Moncton (YQM) on a domestic flight to Toronto. The aircraft landed on runway 06Rwith a 90 degree crosswind from the left, gusting from 13 to 23 knots. The aircraft first contacted the runway in a left-wing-down sideslip. The left main landing gear struck the runway first and the aircraft sustained a sharp lateral side load before bouncing. Once airborne again, the flight and ground spoilers deployed and the aircraft landed hard. Both main landing gear trunnion fittings failed and the landing gear collapsed. The aircraft remained upright, supported by the landing gear struts and wheels. The aircraft slid down the runway and exited via the Delta 3 taxiway, where the passengers deplaned. There was no fire. There were no injuries to the crew; some passengers reported minor injuries as a result of the hard landing. FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1. On final approach, the captain diverted his attention from monitoring the flight, leaving most of the decision making and control of the aircraft to the first officer, who was significantly less experienced on the aircraft type. As a result, the first officer was not fully supervised during the late stages of the approach. 2. The first officer did not adhere to the Air Canada Jazz standard operating procedures (SOPs) in the handling of the autopilot and thrust levers on short final, which left the aircraft highly susceptible to a bounce, and without the bounce protection normally provided by the ground lift dump (GLD) system. 3. Neither the aircraft operating manual nor the training that both pilots had received mentioned the importance of conducting a balked or rejected landing when the aircraft bounces. Given the low-energy state of the aircraft at the time of the bounce, the first officer attempted to salvage the landing. 4. When the thrust levers were reduced to idle after the bounce, the GLD system activated. The resultant sink rate after the GLD system deployed was beyond the certification standard for the landing gear and resulted in the landing gear trunnion fitting failures. 5. There was insufficient quality control at the landing gear overhaul facility, which allowed non-airworthy equipment to enter into service. The condition of the shock struts would have contributed to the bounce.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A07O0124 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources: CADORS Number: 2007O081   Location  Images: photo (c) Never Was An Arrow II; Toronto-Pearson International Airport, ON (YYZ/CYYZ); 20 May 2007; (CC:by-nc-nd) photo (c) Never Was An Arrow II; Toronto-Pearson International Airport, ON (YYZ/CYYZ); 20 May 2007; (CC:by-nc-nd) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The Adamair flight went missing during a domestic flight to Manado. Last contact was at 14:07 when the flight was enroute at FL350. Initial reports indicate that the flight changed course twice as a result of severe (130 km/h) crosswind. The airplane crashed into the sea. On January 11 part of a jetliner's tail, food trays and other debris was pulled from the sea. On January 25 a U.S. navy ship detected signals coming from the flight recorder. The FDR was recovered from a depth of on 2000 m August 27. The CVR was recovered on August 28 from a depth of 1900 m. Investigators found that, during the flight from Surabaya to Manado, the Inertial Reference System (IRS) malfunctioned. Both pilots became engrossed with trouble shooting the IRS anomalies for at least the last 13 minutes of the flight, with minimal regard to other flight requirements. The pilots selected Attitude in the IRS, which disengaged the autopilot. After the autopilot disengaged and the aircraft rolled right and exceeded 35 degrees right bank, the pilots appeared to have become spatially disoriented. Control was lost and the airplane broke up and crashed into the sea. CAUSES:  1) Flight crew coordination was less than effective. The PIC did not manage the task sharing; crew resource management practices were not followed. 2) The crew focused their attention on trouble shooting the Inertial Reference System (IRS) failure and neither pilot was flying the aircraft. 3) After the autopilot disengaged and the aircraft exceeded 30 degrees right bank, the pilots appeared to have become spatially disoriented. 4) The AdamAir syllabus of pilot training did not cover complete or partial IRS failure. 5) The pilots had not received training in aircraft upset recovery, including spatial disorientation. OTHER CAUSAL FACTORS: 1) At the time of the accident, AdamAir had not resolved the airworthiness problems with the IRS that had been reoccurring on their Boeing 737 fleet for more than 3 months. 2) The AdamAir maintenance engineering supervision and oversight was not effective and did not ensure that repetitive defects were rectified.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSC Report number: KNKT/07.01/08.01.36 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   Confusion over missing Indonesian airplane (Int.

At 19:48, air traffic control cleared TW350 out of controlled airspace via the Sandy Bay runway 05 non-directional beacon approach. The crew flew the approach straight-in to runway 05 and initiated a go-around from the landing flare. The aircraft did not maintain a positive rate of climb during the go-around and collided with trees just beyond the departure end of the runway. All four occupants survived the impact and evacuated the aircraft. The captain died of his injuries before rescuers arrived. Both emergency medical technicians were seriously injured, and the first officer received minor injuries. The aircraft sustained substantial damage from impact forces and was subsequently destroyed by a post-impact fire. FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1. The crew was unable to work effectively as a team to avoid, trap, or mitigate errors and safely manage the risks associated with flight TW350. 2. Transwest Air (TWA) managers had identified and addressed some crew pairing issues with respect to this crew, but were unaware of the degree to which these factors could impair their effective crew coordination. 3. The crew's lack of coordination was, in part, because they had not received recent crew resource management (CRM) training. 4. Contrary to company policy, the approach to Sandy Bay, Saskatchewan, was flown by the less experienced crew member. 5. The crew members did not assess the aircraft performance and did not identify runway length as a threat. Consequently, they did not discuss and agree on a point at which a safe landing was no longer possible and were unprepared to make and execute a timely go-around decision. 6. The first officer suggested a go-around at an appropriate time. However, inadequate preparation and coordination by the crew members resulted in the captain rejecting this suggestion and they continued the approach past the point at which the aircraft could be safely stopped on the runway. 7. The captain decided to initiate a go-around, but his communication of this decision to the first officer was non-standard and did not have the desired effect of triggering the correct sequence of go-around actions required. 8. The captain very likely took control of the aircraft from the first officer using the non-standard transfer of control practice the crew had developed, thereby causing confusion, which further eroded the limited opportunity to achieve a positive climb. 9. The discrepancy in the standard operating procedures (SOPs) describing the selection of flaps during go-around likely led to both pilots independently operating the flap control lever, distracting them from monitoring the climb performance during the go-around. 10. It is likely that a somatogravic illusion caused the pilot flying (PF) to lower the nose of the aircraft. Consequently, the aircraft did not maintain a positive rate of climb and collided with the trees. 11. Deficiencies in TWA's supervisory activities permitted the undetected development and persistence of substantial and widespread deviations from SOPs within the King Air operation. 12. The company management structure and workload, combined with the location of managers away from the remote bases of operations, reduced the effectiveness of operational control.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A07C0001 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Flight PE905 departed Grande Prairie (CYQU) at 10:40 MST on the first leg of a scheduled run to Fort St. John (CYXJ), Fort Nelson, BC, and Grande Prairie.  Air traffic control (ATC) cleared the flight to maintain 12 000 feet above sea level (asl), and to hold on the TAYLOR non directional beacon (NDB), which forms the final approach fix for the instrument landing system (ILS) approach to runway 29 at St. John. At 11:09, Flight PE905 was cleared for an ILS approach to runway 29. The first approach was discontinued due to the aircraft being too high on the final approach leg, and clearance was given to return to the TAYLOR NDB at 6000 feet. At 11:23, ATC cleared the flight for another ILS approach to runway 29. The second approach was conducted as a full procedure with the outbound leg extended to ensure that the aircraft was positioned to follow the correct vertical approach profile. The final approach course was flown with a flap setting of 20Âº and at the company standard operating procedure (SOP) recommended airspeed of 130 knots. At approximately 300 feet above ground level, the first officer informed the captain that he had the ground in sight. The approach lights were visual shortly thereafter. The captain discontinued his instrument scan and confirmed the appearance of the approach lights. The captain made the decision to land, and called for the full flap setting of 35Âº. The first officer diverted his attention to setting flaps, and to the Vref reference cards clipped to the instrument panel. When he looked up, the aircraft was almost on the ground, but short of the runway. There was insufficient time to warn the captain. The aircraft initially touched down in a nearly wings-level attitude, 320 feet short of the threshold in about 16 inches of packed snow. The left main gear contacted the surface first, followed by the right main gear, and then the nose wheel. The aircraft then struck the last set of approach lights, bounced slightly, and touched down again 180 feet short of the threshold. After sliding through the threshold lights, the aircraft came to rest on the right edge of the runway, 380 feet beyond the threshold. The right main gear had broken off, and the nose gear had collapsed rearward. Both propellers were damaged by ground contact. The aircraft was equipped with a belly-mounted cargo pod, which supported the fuselage during impact. FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1. A late full flap selection at 300 feet above ground level (agl) likely destabilized the aircraft's pitch attitude, descent rate and speed in the critical final stage of the precision approach, resulting in an increased descent rate before reaching the runway threshold. 2. After the approach lights were sighted at low altitude, both pilots discontinued monitoring of instruments including the glide slope indicator. A significant deviation below the optimum glide slope in low visibility went unnoticed by the crew until the aircraft descended into the approach lights. FINDING AS TO RISK: 1. The crew rounded the decision height (DH) figure for the instrument landing system (ILS) approach downward, and did not apply a cold temperature correction factor. The combined error could have resulted in a descent of 74 feet below the DH on an ILS approach to minimums, with a risk of undershoot. OTHER FINDING: 1. The cockpit voice recorder (CVR) was returned to service following an intelligibility test that indicated that the first officer's hot boom microphone intercom channel did not record. Although the first officer voice was recorded by other means, a potential existed for loss of information, which was key to the investigation.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: TSB Report A07W0005 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: TSB   Location  Images: photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Calgary International Airport, AB (YYC/CYYC); 19 July 1994 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft departed from Balikpapan at 23:00 UTC with a planned flight time of 55 minutes at an altitude of 7000 feet. There were 13 people on board; two pilots, a maintenance engineer, and 10 passengers. The pilot in command (PIC) was the pilot flying for the sector to Tanjung Bara, and the copilot was the monitoring pilot. The flight was normal until 5 minutes before landing when the number 1 (left engine) generator malfunctioned. The pilot in command (PIC) asked the maintenance engineer on board the aircraft, who advised that there was no problem for the aircraft operations. The aircraft made its final approach to runway 04 at Tanjung Bara at 23:50. The aircraft touched down to the right of the centreline, then diverged right into soft wet ground, impacting a channel embankment and subsequently a barbed-wire airport perimeter fence. The investigation determined that aircraft was not being flown on a stabilized approach and subsequently touched down to the right of the runway centerline. It then veered to the right of centerline after touchdown and the PICs effort to bring the aircraft back to the runway centreline by using aileron was ineffective. There was no evidence that visibility affecting visual acquisition of the runway was a factor. However, the investigation considered that a visual approach guidance system such as Visual Approach System Indication (VASI), may have provided additional visual cues to alert the pilots to the prevent the unstabilized approach. Causes: 1. The pilot in command (PIC) continued to land the aircraft from an unstabilized approach. 2. The PIC did not maintain effective and appropriate control of the aircraft on the ground.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSC Report number: KNKT/07.01.03.04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  26 January 2008 PK-VSE Dirgantara Air Services 3 6,3 km Se of Long Apung Airport (LPU) w/o CFIT Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airportâs ground service company was requested to send a special vehicle to embark passengers with reduced mobility. At 15:30, with some 30 passengers already aboard the aircraft, three female passengers were atop the vehicleâs front platform, along with the driver, who was responsible for raising and lowering the platform, and an assistant who was helping the passengers board the airplane. At that moment the frame that held the platform to the truck broke loose from its upper horizontal and lateral braces (Figure 1), leaving a gap between the platform and the aircraft through which the three passengers fell, resulting in serious injuries to two and slight injuries to the third. The operators were able to hold on to the side rails, and one of them was even able to briefly hold on to the passenger who ended up being slightly injured.

Onboard the aircraft were 40 passengers and a crew of 4. On the two previous flights, there had been problems with extending the flaps before landing, first in Paris and then in Valladolid, where the aircraft had to land with the flaps retracted. During the ground tests performed by the crew in Valladolid, the flaps extended and retracted normally, and so the captain decided to continue with the flights as scheduled. During the flight, the crew went over the abnormal procedures to be followed in case of a repeat failure of the flaps system. After taking off from Valladolid, the flaps were retracted normally and remained retracted during the cruise and descent phases until the initial approach to Barcelona, at which time they failed to extend to the 8-degree position when commanded, resulting in a ""flap fail"" warning on the EICAS (Engine Indication and Crew Alerting System). The copilot noted the discrepancy between the commanded 8Â° position on the flaps lever and the 0Â° indicated position. At that time they were below the clouds and under ATC radar control. In the zero-flaps configuration, the ILS approach speed, in accordance with the relevant procedure, had to be maintained above 180 kt. ATC cleared them for the runway 25R approach and informed of a moderate intensity crosswind of 14 kt from 320Â°. The aircraft descended until it touched down at an IAS of 172 kt, at which time the crew realized they had not lowered the landing gear. After a long slide on the runway, the aircraft stopped 240 m before the end of the runway. There was no fire, though high temperatures and kerosene leaks were detected. A firefighting vehicle that was on the tarmac immediately reported to the scene, and sprayed the part of the aircraft in contact with the ground with fire retardant foam. The aircraft, which was stranded in the middle of the runway, was evacuated using the two front doors 1L and 1R, and the 2R overwing exit. The emergency window on the left side was not opened. Two passengers were slightly bruised during the evacuation. The remaining occupants were not injured. CAUSES: ""It is considered that the omission to actuate the landing gear extension lever, before touchdown, was the direct cause of the accident. Consequently, a belly landing in a gear-up configuration followed. A contributing factor was the presence of certain technical anomalies in the operation of the flaps system which detracted from the attention of the crew.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIAIAC Report number: A-003/2007 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Hawaii Island Air, d.b.a. Island Air, was operating the airplane as a positioning flight under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 91.  The airline transport pilot licensed captain, first officer, one flight attendant, and two deadheading pilot crew members were not injured; one deadheading pilot sustained serious injuries.  The airplane was not damaged.  The cross-country repositioning flight departed Honolulu, Hawaii, about 1515, with a planned destination of Kahului, Hawaii.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan had been filed.  The approximate global positioning system (GPS) coordinates of the event were 21 degrees 09.02 minutes north latitude and 157 degrees 05.8 minutes west longitude.The airplane encountered severe turbulence during an en route descent and a captain who was deadheading was not secured in his seat and received serious injuries.  The airplane was being positioned to another airport, and had a deadheading flight crew on board.  Prior to the descent, the captain noted an airspeed anomaly for the existing power setting.  He also observed that the flap indicator showed a ""slight"" deployment of the flaps.  He requested that the deadheading captain look out a cabin window, and verify the flap position.  The deadheading captain reported to the flying captain that the flaps were in the fully retracted position.  About this time, ATC personnel requested that a descent be initiated, which the flight crew initiated by reducing the power to slow down the airplane.  As the deadheading captain was making his way back to his cabin seat, the airplane encountered severe turbulence, which lasted about 5 to 10 seconds.  He was thrown about the cabin and injured.  The flying captain declared an emergency.  The flight landed without incident, and taxied to the gate where the injured crewmember was transported to the hospital.  A review was conducted of the ATC air-ground recordings between Maui approach control (APCON), two other airplanes flying in the area, and the accident airplane (Moku 979).  Prior to Moku 979 checking in with Maui approach, the two other airplanes reported moderate turbulence at 4,000 feet, and moderate to occasional severe turbulence between 2,000 and 2,500 feet.  Both airplanes were about 15 miles east of Maui, in the general vicinity of the accident airplane.  The controller contacted FSS, and advised them of the PIREP's.  About 75 seconds later, Moku 979 reported in to the approach control.  The controller told them to ""expect lower in 5 miles.""  The controller did not advise Moku 979 of the reported turbulence in the area.  Ninety-five seconds later the controller instructed Moku 979 to begin a descent to 1,500 feet.

Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The flight crew reported they depressurized the airplane after a cracked/shattered windshield. They then donned their oxygen masks but were unable to obtain oxygen from the oxygen system resulting in their loss of consciousness. They later regained consciousness, recovered from the descent, and landed without further incident at Cape Girardeau Regional Airport, Cape Girardeau, Missouri. The 14 CFR Part 91 business flight was operating on an instrument flight rules plan. The pilot and copilot were uninjured. The flight originated from Rogers Municipal Airport-Carter Field (ROG), Rogers, Arkansas, at 0839. The business flight was a positioning flight with no passengers aboard. The pilot had the copilot accompany him on the positioning flight so that the copilot could accumulate flight time. The copilot was not a company pilot and had not attended or completed an initial/recurrent training course for the airplane or received a checkout in the airplane. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The company pilot's poor judgment before and during the flight, including turning the oxygen system ready switch to the OFF position after he conducted the preflight inspection and using an unapproved checklist, which did not provide guidance for a fractured windshield and resulted in his depressurizing the airplane.""  Members Hersman and Sumwalt did not approve this probable cause. Member Hersman filed a dissenting statement, with which Member Sumwalt concurred. Hersman stated that the fracturing of the windshield should be cited as a contributing cause of this accident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CHI07LA063 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Cape Girardeau Airport, MO (CGI/KCGI); February 2007; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Cape Girardeau Airport, MO (CGI/KCGI); February 2007; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Cape Girardeau Airport, MO (CGI/KCGI); February 2007; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Cape Girardeau Airport, MO (CGI/KCGI); February 2007; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

On board were one pilot and five passengers. The pilot received fatal injuries in the accident; the passengers mostly suffered serious injuries. Weather conditions at the time were good, but it was after nightfall; the moon had not risen and there was little cultural lighting in the area. The aircraft crashed into a shallow lagoon approximately one nautical mile south-east of North Caicos Airport. Wreckage was spread along a trail that extended in excess of 370 m along a track of 220Â°(M). The aircraft's fuselage had come to rest comparatively intact, although lying in an inverted attitude. Evidence from the accident site indicated that the aircraft had struck the water in a nominally upright attitude, with only a moderate rate of descent but at relatively high forward speed. From a detailed examination of the wreckage and the circumstances of the accident, it was concluded that the aircraft was structurally intact and probably under control when it struck the surface. The evidence indicated that each engine was producing power throughout the short flight and at the time of impact. Although anomalies were found which suggested that a possible power asymmetry may have existed, this should not have been sufficient to cause the pilot serious control difficulties. None of the passengers described an obvious problem with the aircraft during the flight, and most remained unaware of the impending crash. The circumstances of the accident suggested that the pilot became spatially disorientated, to the extent that the aircraft diverged from its intended flight path and reached an irrecoverable situation. The environmental conditions were conducive to a disorientation event, and a postmortem toxicological examination showed that the pilot had a level of blood alcohol which, although below the prescribed limit, was significant in terms of piloting an aircraft and would have made him more prone to disorientation. The evidence indicated that the pilot had probably started a recovery to normal flight, but too late to prevent the accident. However, his actions had the effect of reducing the descent rate and placing the aircraft in a nearly level attitude at impact. This lessened the impact damage and helped preserve the fuselage structure relatively intact, increasing the passengers' chance of survival. The investigation identified the following causal factors: 1. The aircraft adopted an excessive degree of right bank soon after takeoff. This led to a descending, turning flight path which persisted until the aircraft was too low to make a safe recovery. 2. The pilot probably became spatially disorientated and was unable to recognise or correct the situation in time to prevent the accident. Contributory factors: 1. The environmental conditions were conducive to a spatial disorientation event. 2. The pilot had probably consumed alcohol prior to the flight, which made him more prone to becoming disorientated.  3. The flight was operated single-pilot when two pilots were required under applicable regulations.  The presence of a second pilot would have provided a significant measure of protection against the effects of the flying pilot becoming disorientated.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: 2/2010 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) AAIB; near North Caicos Airport (NCA); February 2007 photo (c) AAIB Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane sustained substantial damage and the three occupants, an airline transport pilot, flight paramedic and flight nurse, were killed. The Emergency Medical Services (EMS) positioning flight departed Great Falls International Airport, MT (GTF), at 20:40. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the departure airport and dark night visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the destination airport. The airplane was approximately 42 nautical miles from the tower-controlled destination airport, when the pilot was cleared for the visual approach. The flight did not arrive at the airport and reports were received that it had crashed. The wreckage was located later that evening approximately 80 feet below the peak of a ridge that rose to an elevation of approximately 5,700 feet.  The airport is located in a large valley and is surrounded by rising mountainous terrain. At night, clouds and terrain are difficult for pilots to see, and a gradual loss of visual cues can occur as flight is continued toward darker terrain. Additionally, the horizon is less visible and less distinct at night than during the day. Because the pilot was descending the airplane over rural, mountainous terrain that provided few visual ground reference cues, and because the overcast cloud layer would have prevented moonlight from illuminating the terrain, it is likely that the pilot did not see the rising terrain as the airplane continued toward it. The airplane was equipped with an Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System; however, impact damage to the unit precluded post accident testing. It is not known how the unit was configured during the flight or what type of alerts the pilot received prior to impact. Post accident examination of the wreckage, to include both engines, did not disclose evidence of a mechanical malfunction prior to impact. Additionally, no evidence was found to suggest an in-flight structural failure.

Weather at the TLZ was good, with a visibility of 25 km, no significant cloud and a light surface wind. The flight to the TLZ was routine and at approx 17:00 UTC the Hercules began to make its approach to the TLZ. Comms had already been established between ZH876 and the Tactical Air Traffic Controller (Tac ATC) at the TLZ, and the aircraft was subsequently cleared to land. An uneventful approach followed flown by the co-pilot. At 17:10:15 UTC, as the aircraft was about to touchdown at the TLZ, the crew experienced a load bang and a bright flash. The flash temporarily blinded the flight-deck crew. Virtually simultaneously, the aircraft touched down. The first flash was followed, a second later, by another flash and louder bang. The aircraft slewed off the left-hand side of the runway. The captain took over control of the aircraft. On regaining vision, the captain tried to steer the aircraft back onto the runway. However, the crew became aware of a fire on the port side, which was confirmed as a wing fire. The captain brought the aircraft to an immediate halt. The aircraft came to rest 50 m from the runway edge, some 700 m after touchdown.  The aircraft sustained substantial damage and it was decided to blow up the plane because the damage was too difficult to repair and there was also a potential risk that anti-Iraqi forces might obtain information on specialist equipment. CONCLUSIONS: ""The evidence recovered from the incident site revealed that two IED [improvised explosive device] arrays had exploded in the near vicinity of ZH876's touchdown point at the TLZ. The Board quickly ruled out aircraft systems failure and other possible causes. The Board concluded that this deliberate enemy action was the sole cause of the damage sustained to ZH876 in this incident.  The Board further concluded that there was a lack of understanding, by the Force Protection personnel, of TLZ sweep procedures and they had not received the appropriate training. This meant that the sweep procedures applied at the TLZ were inadequate to discover the IED arrays.""Accident investigation:   Report number: final reoport Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: Hercules plane destroyed in Iraq (BBC 13-2-2007)  Lyneham Herc kept out of enemy hands (Swindon Advertiser, 13-2-2007)  Military Aircraft Accident Summary (MAAS), Aircraft","Rolls-Royce AE2100D3",NA,"https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20070212-0"

At 14:30 hours the aircraft was rolled out of a heated hangar and towed to the apron of the Vnukovo-3 business terminal. At 15:57 the crew radioed a request to start the engines. This was allowed by ATC and the crew read back:  ""CK, start up approved and we will be ready in 10 to 15 minutes for taxi and take off due to deicing procedure"". At 16:01 the aircraft was towed to the anti-icing platform, where, at the request of the captain, it was processed in two stages by type I and type IV fluids. At 16:18 after the anti-icing treatment of the aircraft was completed, it was towed to the beginning of taxiway 14, where the engines were started. After working the necessary checklists the flight was cleared to taxi to runway 06 for departure. At 16:36 the flight was cleared for takeoff.  The airplane lifted off runway 06 about 1,500 meters from the threshold, and immediately banked sharply to the left. It then banked sharply to the right, hitting the runway with the right wingtip. The airplane continued to roll to the right until it was inverted, and veered off the right side of the runway. It came to rest 1,950 meters from the runway threshold, about 35 meters to the right of the runway's edge. PROBABLE CAUSE (translated from Russian): The accident with the aircraft CRJ100-SE registration number N168CK occurred as a result of loss of the lifting properties of the wing during the take-off phase, which led to the stalling of the aircraft immediately after detachment from the runway, collision of the right wing tip with the surface of the runway, subsequent destruction and fire.  The reason for the loss of the bearing properties of the wing under the actual meteorological conditions (moderate to strong rainfall, temperature minus 6Â°C, dew point minus 7Â°C) was the effect of ground icing, despite the anti-icing treatment that could be caused by a combination of the following factors: - deficiencies in the guidance documents defining the procedure for de-icing aircraft in a two-stage procedure, which resulted in the possibility of a different interpretation of the requirements for the start of a 3-minute interval between the first and second stages of processing;  - non-receipt by the crew of meteorological documentation in full in preparation for the flight and, as a consequence, inability to correctly determine the protective action time of the LOA and failure to take measures to re-process the aircraft;  - violation of the airway route recommended by the AFM, and non-retention of the recommended 3-minute interval between the first and second stages of treatment; - lack of proper control by crew members and / or airline representatives for the completeness and quality of anti-icing treatment;  - non-inclusion by the crew of the PIC wing before take-off, which is a mandatory requirement of the AFM for the actual weather conditions.  The protuberance of the sealant on the upper and lower surfaces of the wing by an amount significantly exceeding the limitation of the current technical conditions, as well as the beginning of the nose wheel lift of the aircraft at a speed of 12 knots less than the recommended one, reduced the margin for the stall angle of attack. The existing procedural method for monitoring the aerodynamic surfaces of the aircraft before departure, along with the inefficiency at the take-off stage of the existing stall protection system, because of the increased sensitivity of the wing, even to a slight contamination of the leading edge, can not fully guarantee the prevention of such incidents in the future.METAR: 13:36 UTC / 16:36 local time: UUWW 131330Z 13005MPS 1000 R06/1000N SHSN VV003 M06/M07 Q1009 TEMPO 0700 +SHSN RMK 06511040 QBB100=wind 130 degrees at 10 kts, visibility 1000 m in snow showers with a 300 ft.vertical visibility, Temperature -6Â°C, Dewpoint -7Â°C,QNH 1009 hPaAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB id NYC07RA064   Location  Images: photo (c) albspotter; Frankfurt International Airport (FRA); 16 November 2006; (CC:by-nc) photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Frankfurt International Airport (FRA/EDDF); November 2006 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The DHC-8-400 had stopped short of the runway, at intersection Holding Position JA1, prior to taking off. The following Boeing 777 was cleared to Holding Position J1, at the beginning of the runway, which involved taxiing beyond JA1. The crew of the B777 were cautioned about the presence of the DHC-8 as they continued towards J1. As the B777 passed behind the DHC-8, its right wingtip struck the DHC-8âs rudder.  The B777 suffered minor scratching to its wingtip. The DHC-8âs rudder was damaged and required replacement. AAIB Analysis Whilst the crew of G-JEDR reported that they had stopped âon the lineâ at the holding position, analysis showed that if the aircraft had been stopped with its nose precisely above the relevant marking, and that AP-BGY had been following the taxiway centreline, the two aircraft would not have collided. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that G-JEDR had stopped a few metres short of the holding position, which was consistent with allowing the crew a view of the stop bar, as is normal aviation practice. The decision by the commander of AP-BGY to deviate slightly from the taxiway centreline, as he passed G-JEDR, was to increase what he considered would be a small miss-distance between the two aircraft. The method used by the GMC controller when directing departing aircraft for either full length or intersection departures, in order to present the Tower controller with opportunities to expedite the flow of traffic, was in accordance with normal ATC practice. Both controllers had expected AP-BGY to hold short of the link to JA1, until G-JEDR had moved forward. The clearances issued, for AP-BGY to taxi to J1, were correct. However, the cautions to the flight crew, which represented essential aerodrome information âto assist him [the pilot] in preventing collisions with parked aircraftâ, as described in MATs Part 1, were not understood by them as meaning that there was a risk of a collision if they taxied past G-JEDR.

The first officer was flying the airplane. The captain reported they were cleared for the ILS runway 24R approach. Approximately 10 minutes prior to landing, air traffic control changed the landing runway to runway 28. The captain stated they were informed that the runway visual range (RVR) was 6,000 feet and that the braking action was fair. Also, the glideslope for the ILS runway 28 approach was unusable at the time of the accident due to the snow. After passing the final approach fix, they were informed that the RVR had decreased to 2,000 feet. The captain had the approach lights in sight and at 50 feet above the ground, he had the runway in sight. The first officer then turned off the autopilot to land. At 30 feet above the ground the captain momentarily lost sight of the runway. He then regained sight of the runway and the airplane was landed. They encountered strong gusty winds during the landing flare and after touchdown they could barely see the runway lights and taxiway turn-offs. Despite the use of full reverse and braking, the airplane did not seem to slow down. The airplane traveled off the runway and into the snow covered grass and went partially through the fence before coming to a stop more than 150 feet past the end of the runway. Runway 28 is 6017 feet long. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the failure of the flight crew to execute a missed approach when visual cues for the runway were not distinct and identifiable. Contributing to the accident were (1) the crewÂs decision to descend to the instrument landing system decision height instead of the localizer (glideslope out) minimum descent altitude; (2) the first officerÂs long landing on a short contaminated runway and the crewÂs failure to use reverse thrust and braking to their maximum effectiveness; (3) the captainÂs fatigue, which affected his ability to effectively plan for and monitor the approach and landing; and (4) Shuttle AmericaÂs failure to administer an attendance policy that permitted flight crewmembers to call in as fatigued without fear of reprisals.""METAR: 20:17 UTC / 15:17 local time: KCLE 182017Z 33013G19KT 1/4SM +SN BKN003 BKN010 OVC015 M08/M11 A3003 RMK AO2 P000020:33 UTC / 15:33 local time: KCLE 182033Z 32013KT 1 1/2SM -SN SCT003 BKN011 OVC028 M08/M11 A3004 RMK AO2 P0000Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NTSB/AAR-08-01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   NTSB/AAR-08/01   Location  Images: photo (c) Chuck Slusarczyk Jr; Cleveland-Hopkins International Airport, OH (CLE/KCLE); 18 February 2007 photo (c) NTSB; Cleveland-Hopkins International Airport, OH (CLE/KCLE); February 2007; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Cleveland-Hopkins International Airport, OH (CLE/KCLE); February 2007; (publicdomain) photo (c) aeroprints.com; Rantoul, KS; 30 April 2013; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) aeroprints.com; Rantoul, KS; 30 April 2013; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The international air carrier flight was in cruise flight at the time of the accident.  The captain stated the flight ""encountered a brief (2-3 second) but very intense moderate-to-severe turbulence event"" at flight level 340.  He noted that continuous moderate turbulence continued for approximately 30 seconds, and periods of occasional-to-continuous moderate chop continued for about 10 minutes after the initial encounter.  He added that there were no returns on the weather radar, and no pilot reports or adverse ride reports received from air traffic control.  The fasten seat belt sign was on at the time of the encounter because the flight had encountered light chop after leveling off at cruise altitude.  He reported that the ride had been smooth for approximately 10 minutes prior to the turbulence event.  The injured flight attendant stated that she was working in the aft galley when the turbulence began.  She reported that she hit her head on the ceiling and landed on the galley floor with her leg bent under her.  The Flight Data Recorder (FDR) revealed that the airplane encountered a vertical acceleration ranging from 0.245 G to 1.246 G.  The data also indicated that the autopilot was engaged, and no pitch inputs were made from the cockpit at the time of the encounter.  Postaccident inspections did not reveal any damage to the airplane.

After the right generator came online an electrical failure occurred in the right main bus. The failure resulted in severe internal arcing and short circuits inside the two main power contactors of the right main bus. The heat generated during the failure resulted in the contactor casings becoming compromised, causing molten metal droplets to fall down onto the insulation blankets below. The insulation blankets ignited and a fire spread underneath a floor panel to the opposite electrical panel (P205), causing heat and fire damage to structure, cooling ducts and wiring. The flight crew responded to the bus failure and a burning smell by shutting down the right engine and taxiing to a nearby stand. The Airfield Fire Service attended the aircraft when it arrived on stand and entered the Main Equipment Centre where they discovered significant smoke but no fire. The passengers were evacuated uneventfully via steps. CAUSAL FACTORS: 1. An internal failure of the Right Generator Circuit Breaker or Right Bus Tie Breaker contactor on the P200 power panel inside the Main Equipment Centre resulted in severe internal arcing and short-circuits which melted the contactor casings. The root cause of contactor failure could not be determined. 2. The open base of the P200 power panel allowed molten metal droplets from the failed contactors to drop down onto the insulation blankets and ignite them. 3. The aircraftÂs electrical protection system was not designed to detect and rapidly remove power from a contactor suffering from severe internal arcing and short-circuits. 4. The contactors had internal design features that probably contributed to the uncontained failures.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: AAIB AAR 2/2009 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ  History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  13 December 1999 N786UA United Airlines 0 NW of London-Heathrow Airport (LHR/EGLL) non Turbulence 13 September 2023 N786UA United Airlines 0 30 nm W of Yarmouth, NS non Loss of pressurization Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight that had been initially planned for 26th February 2007, was postponed several times due to adverse meteorological conditions, causing problems with provision supply on Ruhnu island. On Friday, 3rd March, pilot checked the weather at 15:00 and at 16:00. Based on the received information the pilot decided to depart for Ruhnu at 16:00. At 16:08, the aircraft took off from PÃ¤rnu airport with a pilot, two passengers and 520 kg of cargo on board. According to the weather briefing received by the pilot via telephone from Kuressaare, at 16:00 the cloud height in Kuressaare (EEKE, 36 Nm northwest of Ruhnu) was 600 ft. and 180 m (approximately 540 ft.) in Ruhnu. During the uneventful flight on the altitude 1500 ft., the coast and the ice border were clearly visible. The aircraft stayed clear from the clouds and no signs of icing were noticed by persons on board. Approaching the island from the northeast it was intended by the pilot to use runway 32 for landing. The pilot decided to fly low from east to west across the runway to check the windsock and runway condition. While approaching the island, the pilot descended at the rate of 150 ft/min with low power settings and flaps extended by 1 notch. During descent the horizontal and vertical visibility deteriorated and the flight was continued in IMC. The descent was continued in clouds; therefore the pilot had no visual contact with the ground and horizon. The aircraft broke through the clouds over the coast at a very low altitude (100-120 feet). Trying to maintain safe altitude and speed pilot added power, at the same time stall warning signal activated and seconds later the lower part of aircraft's fuselage touched the treetops and collided with the terrain at 16:36.  The passengers and pilot escaped the aircraft without assistance and with no injuries. Causes of the accident: The investigation established the following causes of the accident: 1. The pilot could not maintain safe flight altitude when approaching Ruhnu aerodrome. 2. The pilot continued the descent in spite of IMC. Contributing factors to the accident The investigation established the following factors contributing to the accident: 1. High motivation to perform the flight. 2. Inadequate weather information from ground services of Ruhnu aerodrome. 3. Inadequate aeronautical oversight in the destination airport.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MinEcon Report number: EE030/030307 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 years and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Delfi  Images: photo (c) Karl KrÃ¤mer, via Werner Fischdick; Harle Airport (EDXP); August 2003 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Garuda flight 200 was an early morning service from Jakarta (CGK) to Yogyakarta (JOG). The pilot in command (PIC) was the pilot flying, and the copilot was the support/monitoring pilot. The PIC intended to make an instrument landing system (ILS) approach to runway 09 at Yogyakarta and briefed the copilot accordingly. Yogya Approach cleared the aircraft for a visual approach, with a requirement to proceed to long final and report runway in sight. Although the crew acknowledged the visual approach clearance, they continued with the ILS approach, but did not inform the controller. The descent and approach were conducted in visual meteorological conditions. At 07:55:33, when the aircraft was 10.1 miles from the runway, it was 1,427 feet above the initial fix of 2,500 feet published in the approach chart, and the airspeed was 283 knots. The pilot in command descended the aircraft steeply in an attempt to reach the runway, but in doing so, the airspeed increased excessively. As the aircraft was being flown at speeds that were in excess of the wing flaps operation speed, the copilot elected not to extend the flaps as instructed by the PIC. During the approach, the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) alerts and warnings sounded 15 times and the copilot called for the PIC to go around. The PIC continued the approach with flaps 5 degrees, and the aircraft attained the glideslope near the runway 09 threshold. Flaps 5 degrees is not a landing flap setting. The aircraft crossed the threshold, 89 feet above the runway, at an airspeed of 232 knots, 98 knots faster than the required landing speed for flaps 40 degrees. The wind was north easterly at 9 knots. The groundspeed was 235 knots. The aircraft touched down at an airspeed of 221 knots, 87 knots faster than landing speed for 40 degrees flap. Shortly after touching down, the copilot called, with high intonation, for the PIC to go around. The aircraft overran the departure end of runway 09, to the right of the centerline at 110 knots. The aircraft crossed a road, and impacted an embankment before stopping in a rice paddy field 252 meters from the threshold of runway 27 (departure end of runway 09). The aircraft destroyed by the impact forces and an intense, fuel-fed, post-impact fire. CAUSES:  ""1. Flight crew communication and coordination was less than effective after the aircraft passed 2,336 feet on descent after flap 1 was selected. Therefore the safety of the flight was compromized.  2. The PIC flew the aircraft at an excessively high airspeed and steep descent during the approach. The crew did not abort the approach when stabilized approach criteria were not met. 3. The pilot in command did not act on the 15 GPWS alerts and warnings, and the two calls from the copilot to go around. 4. The copilot did not follow company instructions and take control of the aircraft from the pilot in command when he saw that the pilot in command repeatedly ignored warnings to go around. 5. Garuda did not provide simulator training for its Boeing 737 flight crews covering vital actions and required responses to GPWS and EGPWS alerts and warnings such as ÂTOO LOW TERRAINÂ and ÂWHOOP, WHOOP PULL UPÂ.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSC Report number: KNKT.07.03.05.04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   KNKT  NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) I.

Two low passes were flown, at 500 feet over the runway. The crew then attempted to extend the nose landing gear by utilizing acceleration force during a steep turn. When this did not work, a touch-and-go was made so as to apply an impact to the nose landing gear. The flight crew when concluded that they had to make a landing with the nose gear retracted. The captain directed the cabin attendants to move some passengers to aft cabin and fire extinguishing agent was sprayed on the runway. At 10:54 a landing was carried out. The airplane sustained structural damage on the lower part of the forward fuselage. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""It is recognized that this accident was caused by that, in spite of gear down operations in flight by normal and alternative procedures, the nose landing gear could not be extended because the doors of the nose landing gear remained closed, and when the Aircraft landed in this configuration, the lower part of the forward fuselage contacted the runway surface and was damaged. It is recognized that the doors of the nose landing gear remained closed because the spacer migrated out from the hinge part of the toggle link assy, which was part of the nose landing gear door linkage mechanism, interfered with the support fitting, thereby prevented the movement of the toggle link assy, which resulted in restraining the movement of the entire nose landing gear door linkage mechanism. It is estimated that the spacer migrated out because the bolt, nut and the like were not installed, and the spacer was gradually pulled aft out of the toggle link assy under the influence of retractions/extensions of the nose landing gear, airframe vibration, aircraft acceleration and so on, during operations of the Aircraft. Regarding that the bolt, nut and the like were not installed, it is considered that these parts were not re-installed at the time of the repair in the manufacturing process of the Aircraft.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JTSB Report number: AA2008-5 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  17 March 2019 RA-67252 Aurora 0 Kupol Airport (KPX) non 8 July 2020 RA-67252 Aurora 0 Yuzhno-Kurilsk Mendeleyevo Airport non Taxiway excursion 8 January 2025 RA-67252 Aurora 0 near Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Airport (UUS/UHSS), Sakhalin Oblast non 22 February 2025 RA-67252 Aurora 0 near Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Airport (UUS/UHSS), Sakhalin Oblast non Bird strike Location  Images: photo (c) JTSB; Kochi Airport (KCZ/RJOK); March 2007 photo (c) JTSB; Kochi Airport (KCZ/RJOK); March 2007 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The captain reported that the landing lights illuminated the ducks and in less than a second the airplane struck the ducks. The left engine fan blade was struck by 3-5 ducks at the midspan shroud liberating the fan blade tip, which was contained.  The impact resulted in movement of the variable stator vanes and 2.5 bleed valves. The engine then made an uncommanded shutdown. The hydraulic pressure supply manifold broke due to high vibratory fatigue after the impact, which also resulted in minimizing the amount of fuel released into the engine nacelle. The airplane returned for landing at the departure airport without further incident.

Tambo International Airport (FAJS) to Durban International Airport (FADN) and arrived at FADN at 1915Z. According to the pilot, they used the aircraft's weather radar to help them avoid adverse weather during the descent to FADN. The radar operated satisfactorily during the descent and approach for landing. After landing at FADN, the aircraft was turned around in 45 minutes for the return flight SA6582 to FAJS. The crew taxied to runway 06, the active runway at the time, but just prior to take-off, ATC advised the pilot that a Boeing B737-800 had had to execute a go-round due to a tailwind component with the surface wind at 240/15kt. The pilot and co-pilot repositioned the aircraft and prepared to take off from runway 24. The fire crew reported that there was no standing water on the runway, although it was raining quite heavily. From their position at the threshold of runway 24, the pilot carefully scanned the area with the weather radar but this showed no returns. The Boeing B737-800 which approached from that direction supported the radar information that it was safe for take-off. After the co-pilot (pilot-flying) concurred with the pilot (pilot non-flying) that it was safe for take-off, they obtained take-off clearance from the ATC. Maximum thrust on both engines was selected and the aircraft climbed away steeply. As there were no radar returns indicated ahead or to the right of the aircraft, the co-pilot commenced the right-hand turn towards the Greytown VOR (GYV) at an IAS of 280 kts. The pilot and co-pilot individually checked that the weather radar settings were correct and adjusted the tilt, gain, range and stab settings but no green, yellow or red returns appeared on the radar. At 9 000ft AMSL, light hail was encountered and the crew selected the 'Engine Anti-Ice'? as well as the 'Low Ignition'? switches to the ON position. The hail seemed to lessen but shortly thereafter, it became much worse with the radar screen still remaining completely clear. The co-pilot then made a 30 degree turn to the right and the captain asked ATC if they had any weather returns on their radar, but due to the noise of the hail on the fuselage, ATC was unable to hear the transmission clearly. Some moderate turbulence was experienced which became severe in short bursts. At this stage, the captain and co-pilot had to communicate using hand signals. The captain scanned the radar in an attempt to find a clear path through the clouds and also monitored the co-pilot's flying. All engine parameters remained normal. The aircraft continued climbing in a north-easterly direction and at 15 000 ft AMSL, cleared the clouds and continued to its destination without further incident.  Probable Cause The aircraft encountered severe hail during climb-out after taking off from Durban International Airport. The aircraft's weather radar did not show any hail on the radar screen.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CAA S.A.

None of the four crewmembers or two passengers were injured. The air ambulance flight was flying a GPS runway 16 approach at Beverly (BVY). After passing the initial approach fix they entered a cloud, and noticed that there was ""quite a bit of wind"" which they had to compensate for. Moments later, the first officer noticed that they were picking up a trace amount of rime ice on the windscreen; however, since neither pilot saw any ice on the wings, the de-icing boots were never activated. As they neared the final approach fix (FAF), they ""added a notch"" of approach flaps, and then added full flaps when they crossed the FAF. After reaching the minimum descent altitude, they acquired the field and the visual approach slope indicator (VASI). Once established on the VASI, the approach to landing seemed normal until reaching approximately 100 feet above ground level. The crew then experienced what they described as a ""burble,"" and the airplane rolled ""steeply"" to the right, striking the surface of the runway overrun area. After landing and taxiing to the ramp, the flight crew conducted a postflight inspection of the airplane. They noted that approximately 4 feet of the right wing was bent upward about 10 degrees, and ""Light rime ice"" was present on the leading edges of the wings, horizontal stabilizer and radome. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The inadequate guidance and procedures provided by the airplane manufacturer regarding operation of the pneumatic de-icing boots.

Upon departure from Surgut, the weather at Samara was below minima with a visibility of 200 m in fog. An improvement was expected to a visibility of 3000 m upon arrival. The Tupolev Tu-134 took off at 04:08 UTC, climbing to the cruising altitude of 10600 m. En route weather reports showed an improvement to a visibility of 1500 m at Samara.  At 06:18 UTC (11:18 local time), shortly after contacting Samara Control, the captain briefed the crew about the arrival procedures for Samara. During the briefing he incorrectly stated that the altitude at which they would capture the glide slope was 500 m (the actual height is 400 m according to the approach charts). About 06:22, Samara Control cleared the flight to descend to 5400 m. During their descent, about 06:30, the ground wind at Samara Airport changed direction from west (270-290Â°) to southeast (120Â°) with fog again worsening the visibility. Samara Approach cleared the flight further down to 2400 m and reported of 1200 m with haze and fog. At 06:35 the crew received further clearances in preparation for an approach to runway 23 and the controller reported pressure at the airfield being 745 mm Hg. At 06:37 visibility dropped to 800 m. The meteorological station officer did not inform air traffic control, although he was aware of this significant drop in visibility. Shortly afterward a visibility of 608 m was registered, which was below airport landing minima. This value was not noted by the met station officer and thus not passed on to ATC. At 06:38:53 the flight reported at 400 m. The crew was then instructed to contact the Samara Landing controller, which they did. At 06:40 UCT air traffic control contacted the met station to inquire about the cloud base and horizontal visibility. The met officer reported fog with 800 m visibility but did not mention the cloud base. The cloud base according to the latest ATIS information was 490 m. The actual cloud base measured at the time of the approach was about 30 m. At 06:40:10, at a speed of 380 km/h, the flight engineer lowered the landing gear and the captain trimmed the stabilizer. At 06:40:43, at a speed of 350 km/h, the flaps were extended to 20 degrees. At the same time, the Tu-134 was 10 km on finals, the controller reported the (incorrect) visibility of ""800 m in fog"". At 06:41:09., 8 km out, at a speed of 320 km/h, the flaps were set at 30 degrees.  At 06:41:45 the airplane passed the Outer Marker at 200 m. The navigator failed to inform the crew that they had passed the Outer Marker. Thus the pilot did not inform the controller, in order to obtain landing clearance. When the controller inquired about their position, the crew reported ready for landing. At 06:41:55 they were cleared to land. The vertical rate of descent was 6 m/s, which exceeded the recommended rate of descent. The aircraft passed the Inner Marker at a height of 60 m, and a vertical rate of descent of 5,5 m/s with a lateral deviation from the runway axis to the right, no less than 40 m with a further tendency to the right. At decision height the crew had not established positive visual contact with the approach lights. The approach was continued until the airplane contacted the ground, at 06:42:33, 300 m short of the runway and 100 m to the right of the extended centreline. The left wing separated from the fuselage and the plane rolled on its back. The Technical Commission came to the following conclusion: The reason for the crash of TU-134A RA-65021 during the approach to landing at Kurumoch Airport, Samara, in weather conditions significantly below minima for the airport, aircraft, and crew, was the destruction of the aircraft during its travel over the ground after a hard touchdown 300 meters short of the runway and 100 meters to the right of the approach course. The accident resulted from organizational, technical, and procedural deficiencies in the work and interaction of the weather and air traffic control services, as well as from crew errors. Deficiencies in the standards and technical documentation of the Samara Airport made it impossible for Air Traffic Control to inform the crew on a timely basis of the readings from the KRAMS-4 weather station, which indicated a deterioration of weather conditions below airport minima. At decision height, in the absence of reliable visual contact with the approach lights and airport environment, the flight crew did not make a timely decision to execute a missed approach. The air traffic controllerÂs failure to use the full capability of the radar equipment because of contradictions in the relevant standards and procedures documents, as well as poor coordination among the flight crew and their delay in executing a missed approach, made it impossible to avoid a tragedy. The lack of unified federal regulations covering flight operations, Air Traffic Control, and weather and other services, taking into account both domestic and international experience in flight safety, contributed to this aviation accident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: ITAR-TASS  MAK Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC)   Location  Images: photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Praha-Ruzyne International Airport (PRG/LKPR); June 1999 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The crew reported the en route portion of the flight was uneventful. As the airplane approached RIL, the crew checked the automated surface observing system (ASOS) report which reported the sky overcast at 4,000 feet and no rain. During the downwind leg to runway 26, the crew could see the runway. Prior to the final approach fix for the ILS approach to runway 26 and approximately 8 miles from the airport, the crew had the runway in sight. The crew communicated their intentions on the RIL common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF). The pilot flew the airplane on the glideslope approximately Vref (Final Approach Speed) 128 knots plus 10-15 knots, then below 1,000 feet, Vref plus 10 knots. The pilot stated that the airplane touched down approximately 1,500 feet from the approach end of runway 26. The co-pilot reported the airbrake was in the #2 position and they had ""good anti-skid indication"" after touchdown. The pilot ""began braking, deployed the thrust reverser, and continued to increase brake pressure as it didn't seem like a normal deceleration rate. With approximately 2,500 feet of runway remaining, the airplane continued to not decelerate normally, and the pilot knew they did not have enough runway to execute a go-around. With approximately 1,000 feet of runway remaining, the pilot pulled the parking brake to the second detent, and the aircraft slid off the end of the runway into the dirt and muddy terrain. It came to rest 268 feet past the runway end. The right main landing gear trunnion had sheared from its attach points, rotated up and punctured wing skin. The main landing gear strut impacted the aft spar and sheared rib 3, which compromised the wing fuel tank. The forward main landing gear trunnion exited the forward trunnion bore, and the aft spar was fractured.

The airplane received substantial damage. One passenger received minor injuries.  The flight originated from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, at 12:55.  The flight crew was in cruise flight when a master caution light illuminated indicating a loss of the right hydraulic system pressure and hydraulic fluid. The crew used the checklist to trouble shoot the system and attempted to manually extend the main and nose landing gear (NLG) using the alternate extension control lever. Both main gear extended and locked into place; however the NLG did not extend. The airplane was landed with the NLG in the retracted position. Initial inspection of the airplane revealed that a B-nut to the check valve on the rudder power hydraulic shut off valve, was separated from the valve resulting in a total loss of right hydraulic quantity and pressure. Examination of the hydraulic tube, including the B-nut and check valve, did not reveal any abnormalities. Examination of the cockpit revealed the landing gear handle was in the stowed position. A placard on the alternate landing gear extension lever stated, ""Pull up forcibly Full Stroke."" The airplane was placed on jacks and maintenance personnel successfully extended the nose landing gear. The alternate gear extension control system was also inspected and no defects were noted.

CONCLUSION The cause of the accident during the engine start-up process was the displacement of the aircraft forward and toward the left due to a higher power setting in the engines of the right wing, which caused the No. 3 engine to strike the ground power unit that was positioned in front of the right wing. It was a series of events that contributed to the incident: a) The removal of chocks by ground personnel without having taken them as a precaution and safety measure first, which led to the decision to move the ground power unit that was in front of the right wing of the aircraft. b) Not using ground-to-cabin communication headsets between the cabin crew and the ground technical staff. c) Failing to provide a training course to the ground staff by PHOENIX to GIRAG on the operational procedures on the ground for their aircraft. d) Not taking immediate precautions by the crew concerning the limits that the aircraft had when it lost hydraulic pressure. e) Not ensuring that the parking brakes were set and engaged. f) Not operating the air emergency brake lever by the crew members (Captain or Co-pilot) when they noticed that the aircraft started moving forward for no apparent reason, despite having two levers, one in front of each crew member.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAC El Salvador Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: https://portal.aeronautica.gob.pa/upia/archivo/54245_XA-AEG_-29.08.2024_informe_final.pdf Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates18-Jan-2025 17:29 ASN Updated [Time, Source, Damage, Narrative, Accident report, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight was due to land at Hoskins and Rabaul. An area forecast for the flight indicated that there were areas of rain and scattered cloud from 1500-5000 feet with deteriorating conditions forecast for the period between 0400-0800 hours. Last radio contact with the flight was at 05:06 when the crew advised Port Moresby Flight Service that they were overhead Maran. The airplane was declared missing when it failed to arrive at Hoskins and the wreckage was located later that day in a wooded area at an elevation of 238 m. An investigation revealed that the right engine had been shut down and the fire extinguisher for the engine had been activated. However, there was no evidence of in-flight fire in the engine. The airplane descended below the en-route lowest safe altitude of 8,300 feet. At some point the undercarriage was extended. In total darkness, at 05:23, the airplane struck tree tops on gentle sloping terrain. The right wing broke off and the aircraft slid for another 300 m before coming to rest.

The airplane was near the eastern shore of Lake Michigan, about 35 miles west-northwest of Grand Rapids, Michigan, when the accident occurred.  The flight crew received a left thrust reverser unlock indication while holding for takeoff. The captain cycled the reverser, and had decided to return to the gate when the messages cleared. With the issue apparently resolved, he elected to takeoff. The captain reported experiencing a small vibration on climb out and, a short time later, he heard a ""loud bang"" and the ""aircraft pitched and yawed/rolled to [the] left."" The autopilot disengaged and the left thrust lever moved to idle during the event. The first officer ran the checklist to stow the reverser. The captain decided to continue to the intended destination because the thrust reverser messages had cleared and the vibrations had stopped. The flight subsequently landed uneventfully. The flight data recorder (FDR) indicated that the left engine vibration levels were elevated during the accident flight. Approximately 3 minutes into the flight, the left engine thrust reverser unlocked parameter changed to ""On"" for about 1 second. About 11 minutes and 20 seconds after takeoff, the left engine vibration level increased momentarily, and both the left and right engine speeds and fuel flows began to decrease. As the decrease in fuel flows was occurring, the airplane rolled right, left, and right again over about a 4-second period. The decrease in engine parameters lasted over 3 minutes before returning to normal. The left engine thrust reverser unlock parameter indicated ""On"" for about 4 seconds during that time. The left engine vibration levels decreased after the event, below the levels previously recorded during the flight, and approximately to the level of the right engine vibration. The vibration and engine speed variations suggested separation of the left engine translating cowling at that point. The left engine thrust reverser deploy parameter remained in the ""Off"" state for the entire flight. Additionally, the FDR data revealed that the left engine vibration levels were elevated and left engine thrust reverser did not deploy on the two previous flights. The post accident inspection revealed that the left engine translating cowl had separated from the engine assembly and damaged the empennage. Damage to the thrust reverser components was consistent with prior operation with the reverser out of alignment and jamming of the translating structure. In-flight separation of the left engine thrust reverser translating cowling due to intermittent binding and jamming of the reverser on the accident flight and on previous flights. Contributing factors were the inadequate maintenance action by the operator due to their failure to properly resolve the prior reverser malfunctions, the failure of the pilots of previous flights in not referring earlier reverser deployment failures for maintenance action, and incomplete company/manufacturer's procedures because they did not address anomalous reverser indications during ground operations.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CHI07FA107 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot contacted air traffic services and requested further assistance from company engineering personnel to visually assess the extension state of the landing gear. Two aerodrome passes were completed throughout the troubleshooting exercise and the pilot remained in radio contact with both groups during this phase.  Following the flyovers and after holding over Rottnest Island at 5,000 ft for a period of approximately two hours, the pilot flew the King Air back to Perth airport.  With the gear still jammed in the partially retracted position, both the left and right main landing gear assemblies collapsed after the aircraft touched down on runway 24. The aircraft was substantially damaged as a result of the collapse. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau investigation revealed that two major system components had failed which could have prevented the landing gear from properly retracting/extending; the geared components within the right main landing gear actuator had fractured, and the left torque tube support bearing had seized from contamination and lack of lubrication. Although each component failure was apparently unrelated, the examination was not able to conclusively establish which failure had been the primary contributing factor in this landing occurrence. The Super King Air 200 aircraft landing gear system configuration was such that should either one of these component assemblies cease to function, extension or retraction of the landing gear would not have been possible.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ATSB Report number: 200702171 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: ATSB History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  18 January 2005 VH-SGT Network Aviation Australia 0 Perth Airport, WA (PER) sub Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

After the landing gear was in up-position, the vibration disappeared. The flight crew continued the flight normally to the destination. During flight, the flight crew was notified by another company aircraft departed after GA602, that they observed tire debris left on the runway. There was no abnormality during cruise.   During approach briefing, the PIC also  briefed the possibility of landing with one tire has burst. Although landing at maximum landing weight was permitted, the PIC requested a 30 minutes holding to the ATC in order to reduce landing weight.   During visual approach to runway 13, the flight  crew requested to the Hasanuddin Tower for over-flying at an altitude of 400 feet, to verify the main landing gear tires condition.

Automatic weather observation data indicated at 00:30, the visibility was one-half mile in snow, with indefinite ceiling and vertical visibility of 200 feet. Snow removal operations were in progress at the airport, and the flight crew communicated directly with airport operations regarding the runway conditions. After landing, the airplane overran the departure end of runway 28, which is 6,501 feet long, with an additional 200 feet of pavement.

This poor decision-making likely reflected the effects of fatigue produced by a long, demanding duty day; and, for the captain, the duties associated with check airman functions. Contributing to the accident were 1) the Federal Aviation Administration pilot flight and duty time regulations that permitted the pilotsÂ long, demanding duty day and 2) the TVC operations supervisorÂs use of ambiguous and unspecific radio phraseology in providing runway braking information.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NTSB/AAR-08-02 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   NTSB press release April 24, 2007  Pinnacle Airlines Flight 4712 (Pinnacle Airlines news release 12-4-2007)   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Traverse City Airport, MI (TVC/KTVC); 12 April 2007; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The captain advised the flight attendants to have the cabin secured and be in their seats within 15 minutes.  The first officer gave the 'prepare for landing' announcement in the descent around flight level FL250 (25,000 feet), which was after the captain had notified the flight attendants to prepare the cabin, but before the end of the stated 15 minutes.  While descending through 15,500 feet, the airplane experienced a moderate 'jolt' lasting 1-2 seconds.  By this time it had been more than 15 minutes since the captain gave the flight attendants the secure cabin instructions.  The cabin crew reported injuries to all flight attendants and no injuries to passengers.  All six flight attendants received medical attention after landing.  One flight attendant was seriously injured with a closed fibular fracture; the five other flight attendants had minor injuries.  The first officer said that turbulence during their departure had been very bad, therefore, in order to mitigate any passenger anxiety, when he made the 'prepare for landing' announcement, he added that the turbulence would not be as bad as it was on departure.  He understood the captain's instructions to the flight attendants, and this announcement was aimed solely at the passengers. The flight attendants confirmed that they understood the captain's instructions to have the cabin cleaned up and be seated within 15 minutes.  As they were finishing the cabin clean up, the first officer's 'prepare for landing' announcement indicated that the turbulence would not be as bad as they had been told to expect.  The flight attendants may have interpreted this added information concerning turbulence as a relaxation of the captain's earlier instructions.  The Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR) indicated the turbulence occurred as the aircraft was coming out of a 12-degree right bank and descending through 15,400 pressure altitude.  The event lasted approximately 10-11 seconds.  The bank angle of the aircraft was between 8 and 1 degrees right wing down during the event.  Vertical acceleration fluctuated between .5 and 2.06 G's.  Longitudinal acceleration spiked up to .2 G's about the same time as the 2 G vertical spike.  Lateral acceleration fluctuated between .1 G left and .05 G's to the right during the incident.  The data showed that the autopilot was engaged and in control of the aircraft during the incident. Probable Cause: The flight's encounter with a turbulence event that occurred while the flight attendants were unseated.  Contributing to the accident was the apparent conflicting information provided by the flight deck to the flight attendants and the flight attendants' interpretation of that information.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: LAX07LA127 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB LAX07LA127  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates25-Mar-2024 08:44 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

At the same time, the two people assigned to the push-back vehicle were busy disconnecting the towbar connected to the aircraft. A mechanic, in contact with the pilot by wire, removed the steering lock pin. At this point, the Ground controller authorised the crew to taxi behind a B 777. They started taxiing while the push-back vehicle and the three people were still under the aircraft. A few seconds later, engine number 3 hit the pushback vehicle, which was dragged for about twenty metres. The three people on the ground moved away from the area. The aircraft was flown to Tel Aviv on April 16 and resumed regular service on April 18. CONCLUSION Taxiing was started without the procedures for ensuring that the safety zone had been cleared having been applied.

The fire was probably caused by either an electrical spark, or arc from a faulty light, or by an electrostatic discharge from paint spraying equipment while the aircraft was in interior painting works. Contributory factors: (i) The painting process could have generated a layer of flammable vapor close to the cabin floor which may have led to creating flammable vapor pockets under the polythene sheets. (ii) The spread of the fire was probably exacerbated by the lack of fire extinguishers and the quantity of used paint cans, rags, polythene sheets and chemicals existent in the aircraft.

All 108 passengers and six crew members were killed in the accident. The airplane was operated by Kenya Airways as flight KQ507 from Abidjan Airport (ABJ), Ivory Coast to Nairobi (NBO), Kenya via Douala (DLA), Cameroon. The flight from Abidjan to Douala was reportedly conducted without incident.  The flight arrived about 22:00 hours local time, May 4. The scheduled departure time of 23:00 was delayed due to weather which consisted of thunderstorms with heavy rain showers. When the weather improved, flight 507 taxied to runway 12. The aircraft took off and climbed into the dark night. There were no external visual references, yet no instrument scanning was done by the crew. At 1000 feet climbing, the pilot flying released the flight controls for 55 seconds without having engaged the autopilot. The bank angle of the airplane increased continuously by itself very slowly up to 34 degrees right and the captain appeared unaware of the airplaneÂs changing attitude. Just before the ""Bank Angle"" warning sounds, the captain grabbed the controls, appeared confused about the attitude of the airplane, and made corrections in an erratic manner increasing the bank angle to 50 degrees right. At about 50 degrees bank angle, the autopilot was engaged and the inclination tended to stabilize; then movements of the flight controls by the pilot resumed and the bank angle increased towards 70 degrees right. A prolonged right rudder input brought the bank angle to beyond 90 degrees. The airplane descended in a spiral dive and crashed into a mangrove swamp. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The airplane crashed after loss of control by the crew as a result of spatial disorientation (non recognized or subtle type transitioning to recognized spatial disorientation), after a long slow roll, during which no instrument scanning was done, and in the absence of external visual references in a dark night.  Inadequate operational control, lack of crew coordination, coupled with the non-adherence to procedures of flight monitoring, confusion in the utilization of the AP, have also contributed to cause this situation.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CCAA Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Kenya Airways press release  Kenya Airways plane crashes in Cameroon: radio (AP, 5-5-2007)  Reconstructing the last moments of Kenya Airways Flight 507 (AP, 12-5-2007)  Cameroon Civil Aviation Authority press release   Location  Images: photo (c) Tom Lo; London-Heathrow Airport (LHR/EGLL); 29 October 2006 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight crew donned their oxygen masks and diverted to the closest airport in point of time, and landed uneventfully. Postflight inspection of the accident airplane revealed a 12-inch by 5-inch fuselage skin tear, approximately 6 feet forward of the forward cargo door. During the course of the investigation it was revealed that at some point during the aircraft luggage off-loading or loading process, the engine of the belt loader quit operating. The senior of three ground agents working the flight decided to move the belt loader away from the airplane by pushing the belt loader with a luggage tug; however, during the attempt to move the belt loader, the tugâs cab contacted the fuselage.

The pilot, the sole occupant in the airplane, was not injured. The pilot was flying on an activated instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan, which had an intended destination of Kalispell, Montana. The pilot said that he had departed from Billings, Montana, and had climbed to 12,000 feet. About 40 nautical miles northwest of Billings, he heard a ""clunk"" and the red unsafe light in the gear handle came on. He verified that all systems were functioning normally, and he cycled the landing gear up and down to see if that would solve the problem. The unsafe light remained illuminated. The pilot returned to Billings and circled for several hours to burn his fuel load down. He said that at one point he flew low over the runway so the company mechanic, with the aid of a light from an airport vehicle, could visually check the nose gear position. It was hanging out of the wheel well at approximately a 45-degree angle. Upon landing at Billings, the airplane settled to its nose during landing rollout.  Examination of the airplane by an FAA inspector revealed that the nose gear actuator mount bracket area was bent and wrinkled. The nose gear actuator shaft had fractured just above the clevis bolt, which attaches to the drag brace. The failed actuator had been installed on July 26, 2006. The Beech B99 maintenance manual states that the hydraulic actuator needs to be overhauled or replaced every 10,000 hours; maintenance records indicate that this one had 231.4 hours on it at the time of the accident. Metallurgists from both the National Transportation Safety Board and Hawker Beechcraft Corporation examined the failed actuator. Both concluded that all of the fractures were overstress, and no preexisting fatigue signatures were evident. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The total failure of the nose landing gear actuator and the subsequent nose gear collapse during landing.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: SEA07LA133 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB id 20070703X00870   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were no injuries to any crew or passengers.  Flight 8911 departed Moncton (YQM) on a domestic flight to Toronto. The aircraft landed on runway 06Rwith a 90 degree crosswind from the left, gusting from 13 to 23 knots. The aircraft first contacted the runway in a left-wing-down sideslip. The left main landing gear struck the runway first and the aircraft sustained a sharp lateral side load before bouncing. Once airborne again, the flight and ground spoilers deployed and the aircraft landed hard. Both main landing gear trunnion fittings failed and the landing gear collapsed. The aircraft remained upright, supported by the landing gear struts and wheels. The aircraft slid down the runway and exited via the Delta 3 taxiway, where the passengers deplaned. There was no fire. There were no injuries to the crew; some passengers reported minor injuries as a result of the hard landing. FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1. On final approach, the captain diverted his attention from monitoring the flight, leaving most of the decision making and control of the aircraft to the first officer, who was significantly less experienced on the aircraft type. As a result, the first officer was not fully supervised during the late stages of the approach. 2. The first officer did not adhere to the Air Canada Jazz standard operating procedures (SOPs) in the handling of the autopilot and thrust levers on short final, which left the aircraft highly susceptible to a bounce, and without the bounce protection normally provided by the ground lift dump (GLD) system. 3. Neither the aircraft operating manual nor the training that both pilots had received mentioned the importance of conducting a balked or rejected landing when the aircraft bounces. Given the low-energy state of the aircraft at the time of the bounce, the first officer attempted to salvage the landing. 4. When the thrust levers were reduced to idle after the bounce, the GLD system activated. The resultant sink rate after the GLD system deployed was beyond the certification standard for the landing gear and resulted in the landing gear trunnion fitting failures. 5. There was insufficient quality control at the landing gear overhaul facility, which allowed non-airworthy equipment to enter into service. The condition of the shock struts would have contributed to the bounce.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A07O0124 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources: CADORS Number: 2007O081   Location  Images: photo (c) Never Was An Arrow II; Toronto-Pearson International Airport, ON (YYZ/CYYZ); 20 May 2007; (CC:by-nc-nd) photo (c) Never Was An Arrow II; Toronto-Pearson International Airport, ON (YYZ/CYYZ); 20 May 2007; (CC:by-nc-nd) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Four crew members and seven passengers sustained serious injuries. Iran Air Flight IR235 was a scheduled service from Tehran to Shiraz. The co-pilot, who was Pilot Flying, performed a walk around prior to departure. Since it had been snowing and temperatures were around freezing level, he requested de-icing. Because there were a number of aircraft already waiting for de-icing, the pilot in command decided not to perform de-icing. The engines were started and the airplane started taxying towards the departure runway at 07:09 hours. At 07:31 the flight was cleared for takeoff. The aircraft rolled left wing down shortly after lift off. The left wingtip touched the ground. Thereafter the aircraft rolled momentarily back to a more neutral position. A few seconds later, while losing altitude, the second left wing down roll started. The left wing touched the ground and when the aircraft rolled back to a more neutral attitude both main landing gears touched the ground. All gears broke off and the aircraft slid on the area next to the runway. Reportedly, during the impact or shortly thereafter all electrical power was lost. When the aircraft came to rest, a fire developed, starting from the left wing root towards the fuselage. All passengers and crew were evacuated through the two right over wing emergency exits. Cause: It is believed that the accident was caused by the crew fault that has not decided to de-ice aircraft, which led to wing contamination and finally aircraft has stalled during take off.

The pilot, co-pilot, 3 flight attendants, and 68 passengers on board were not injured. The airplane received substantial damage. The flight originated from New York-LaGuardia Airport (LGA), at 06:18. The accident flight was the first one for the airplane after having maintenance performed on the number two (right) engine during the previous evening. The first officer reported he used a flashlight when conducting his preflight inspection of the airplane as it was still dark outside. He reported the engine cowlings were flush, and he did not see any ""hanging"" cowl latches when he looked underneath the engines. The captain reported that the logbooks indicated the number two engine vibration monitor had been replaced during the previous night. He reported the preflight, taxi, and takeoff were normal. The captain reported that during climb out the cockpit received a call from the lead flight attendant who informed them that a passenger reported that the number two engine cowling was flapping after takeoff. A pilot-passenger who was sitting behind this passenger reportedly did not see the cowling move, nor did the flight attendants when they looked out the window. The captain reported he then began to monitor the N1 vibration indications on the number two engine. He reported that the number two engine vibration was approximately double the indication from the number one engine, but the indicator was not flashing nor had it turned amber. During cruise flight the number two engine vibration decreased to equal that of the number one engine. The captain reported that about 20 minutes after they leveled off, the airplane shuddered as if flying through wake turbulence. He reported the remainder of the flight was normal until they were taxiing after landing and the lead flight attendant called the cockpit stating that ""part of the right engine had come off."" The first officer called ground control to warn them that there might be debris on the runway. The crew then shut down the number two engine and taxied to the gate.  The pilot of another airplane later reported seeing part of the engine cowling come off when flight 853 was on a 1-mile final. The other half of the engine cowling was found on the runway and was contacted by an airplane that landed after the accident airplane.  Contract maintenance personnel reported they changed the N1 sensor on the number two engine during the evening prior to the accident. They reported they then shut the fan cowling, but did not latch it as they still needed to perform an engine run and check for leaks. After the engine run was performed, one of the mechanics thought that the other had latched the fan cowling when in fact he had not. While they were doing another task in the cockpit, another mechanic asked for help at another gate. The mechanics left the accident airplane to assist the other mechanic. Neither mechanic returned to the accident airplane to either latch or verify that the fan cowling had been latched.  The maintenance log stated the N1 speed sensor was removed and replaced in accordance with aircraft maintenance manual (AMM) 77-11-10. This section of the AMM states, ""Close the fan cowl doors (Ref. AMM TASK 71-13-00-410-040)."" According to the maintenance personnel, this task was not completed prior to the airplane being returned to service.  The separated cowling contacted the right side of the horizontal stabilizer which resulted in substantial damage to the stabilizer. In addition, the fan cowl doors, number two engine pylon, the number two engine reverser, and the right wing number one slat were damaged. The separation of the engine cowling which resulted from maintenance personnel failing to follow maintenance procedures in that they did not latch the engine cowling following the maintenance inspection.  A factor associated with the accident was their attention was divereted from the task when another mechanic asked for assistance.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CHI08LA071 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

It was scheduled to arrive at Lihue at 05:15. The pilot had routine contact with air traffic control, and was advised by the controller to maintain 6,000 feet at 05:01 when the airplane was 11 miles from the destination airport. Two minutes later the flight was cleared for a visual approach to follow a preceding Boeing 737 (Aloha Airlines Flight 917) and advised to switch to the common traffic advisory frequency at the airport. The pilot altered his flight course to the west, most likely for spacing from the airplane ahead, and descended into the water as he began a turn back toward the airport. The majority of the wreckage sank in 4,800 feet of water. The pilot most likely descended into the ocean because he became spatially disoriented. Although visual meteorological conditions prevailed, no natural horizon and few external visual references were available during the visual approach. This increased the importance of monitoring flight instruments to maintain awareness of the airplane attitude and altitude. The pilot's tasks during the approach, however, included maintaining visual separation from the airplane ahead and lining up with the destination runway. These tasks required visual attention outside the cockpit. These competing tasks probably created shifting visual frames of reference, left the pilot vulnerable to common visual and vestibular illusions, and reduced his awareness of the airplane's attitude, altitude and trajectory.

The director of operations for the operator said that the depression between the runway and the taxiway had been filled with snow by runway maintenance personnel during snow removal operations. He indicated that the area had the illusion of a hard surface, but landing during reduced visibility due to blowing snow required the pilot to take advantage of any and all available resources, such as requesting the activation of the runway lights, and/or using the instrument landing system (ILS) localizer as a means of aligning the airplane with the centerline of the runway.

Initially the approach progressed normally, with the Autopilot and Autothrottle engaged, until the aircraft was at a height of approximately 600 ft and 2 miles from touch down. The aircraft then descended rapidly and struck the ground, some 1,000 ft short of the paved runway surface, just inside the airfield boundary fence. The aircraft stopped on the very beginning of the paved surface of runway 27L. During the short ground roll the right main landing gear separated from the wing and the left main landing gear was pushed up through the wing root. A significant amount of fuel leaked from the aircraft but there was no fire. An emergency evacuation via the slides was supervised by the cabin crew and all occupants left the aircraft, some receiving minor injuries. Initial indications from the interviews and Flight Recorder analyses show the flight and approach to have progressed normally until the aircraft was established on late finals for runway 27L. At approximately 600 ft and 2 miles from touch down, the Autothrottle demanded an increase in thrust from the two engines but the engines did not respond. Following further demands for increased thrust from the Autothrottle, and subsequently the flight crew moving the throttle levers, the engines similarly failed to respond. The aircraft speed reduced and the aircraft descended onto the grass short of the paved runway surface. CAUSAL FACTORS: Whilst on approach to London (Heathrow) from Beijing, China, at 720 feet agl, the right engine of G-YMMM ceased responding to autothrottle commands for increased power and instead the power reduced to 1.03 Engine Pressure Ratio (EPR). Seven seconds later the left engine power reduced to 1.02 EPR. This reduction led to a loss of airspeed and the aircraft touching down some 330 m short of the paved surface of Runway 27L at London Heathrow. The investigation identified that the reduction in thrust was due to restricted fuel flow to both engines. It was determined that this restriction occurred on the right engine at its FOHE. For the left engine, the investigation concluded that the restriction most likely occurred at its FOHE. However, due to limitations in available recorded data, it was not possible totally to eliminate the possibility of a restriction elsewhere in the fuel system, although the testing and data mining activity carried out for this investigation suggested that this was very unlikely. Further, the likelihood of a separate restriction mechanism occurring within seven seconds of that for the right engine was determined to be very low. The investigation identified the following probable causal factors that led to the fuel flow restrictions: 1) Accreted ice from within the fuel system released, causing a restriction to the engine fuel flow at the face of the FOHE, on both of the engines. 2) Ice had formed within the fuel system, from water that occurred naturally in the fuel, whilst the aircraft operated with low fuel flows over a long period and the localised fuel temperatures were in an area described as the Âsticky rangeÂ. 3) The FOHE, although compliant with the applicable certification requirements, was shown to be susceptible to restriction when presented with soft ice in a high concentration, with a fuel temperature that is below -10Â°C and a fuel flow above flight idle. 4) Certification requirements, with which the aircraft and engine fuel systems had to comply, did not take account of this phenomenon as the risk was unrecognised at that time.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: AAIB Report  1/2010 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) Marc-Antony Payne; London-Heathrow Airport (LHR/EGLL); 17 January 2008; (CC:by) photo (c) unknown; London-Heathrow Airport (LHR/EGLL); May 2008 photo (c) Patrick Kirinus; London-Heathrow Airport (LHR/EGLL); 17 June 2007 photo (c) Udo Kirinus; London-Heathrow Airport (LHR/EGLL); 05 May 2002 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The plane was carrying 36 attendees, returning from the 50th Annual Aviation Safety Conference held in Warsaw.  Nine attendees deplaned at Powidz and eleven at PoznÃ¡n-Krzesiny AB. It took off from Krzesiny at 18:24. Weather at Miroslawiec was poor with a ceiling at 300 feet and a visibility 2 sm in mist. The crew were cleared for a PAR approach to runway 12/30. The approach was unstabilized.  On finals, the left bank reached 76 deg and pitch reached -21 degrees. The aircraft hit the ground 1300 m from runway 30 threshold and 320 meters left of extended runway centerline. The aircraft impacted terrain in left sideslip, on heading 220 deg (runway heading was 304 deg), disintegrated and partially burnt. Rate of descent at the moment of ground impact reached approx 6000 feet/min and the ground speed was 148 knots. The aircraft's landing gear was extended and flaps were at 15 degrees setting, at impact. PRIMARY CAUSE: Inadvertent loss of spatial and situational awareness by the aircraft crew during final stages of PAR approach, which, within 12 seconds period before crash, resulted in the aircraftÂs bank increasing unmonitored and accompanying altitude loss, while the flight crew apparently was trying to establish visual contact with runway and approach lights. Among the secondary causes the Board listed: * Improper flight crew selection for the flight:   - The PIC did not have any previous experience on this version of CASA C-295 aircraft, which was additionally equipped with 2 IRS/GPS LN-100G units instead of 2 TOPSTAR 100-2 GPS receivers, and, ironically, with EGPWS Mk. V - unfortunately lack of cryptographic modules in GPS receivers, which made IRS/GPS LN-100G system almost useless (IRS alone with no GPS enhancement) caused flight crew to use handheld GPS receivers (Garmin GPSMAP 196),   - The SIC was not rated in CASA C-295 aircraft for night/IMC operations, * Poor flight crew coordination and cooperation (poor MCC & CRM): 	- improper altimeter setting procedures, 	- probably both pilots were looking for visual cues and nobody was observing flight instruments in the very last seconds before they crash), * Poor weather conditions in vicinity of Miroslawiec AB; ceiling 300 feet, visibility 2 sm, in mist. Icing was excluded as a factor. * Spatial disorientation of the flight crew, * EGPWS Audio warning was inhibited (the flight crew missed EGPWS test before departure from Warsaw, even though it was a checklist item, and never corrected the problem - the PIC was not familiar with the system - he has never flown before CASA C-295M equipped with EGPWS) - in result no audio warning of excessive bank angle, high terrain closure rate and high sink rate was available to the flight crew, as well as no automatic height above ground callouts were given, * The flight crew failed to monitor radio-altimeter indication during both approaches, * Both pilots concentrated their attention outside of the cockpit during final seconds before crash and did not scan flight instruments. * The military PAR controller did a poor job during the approach, he let for the non-stabilized approach, he was not compensating properly for left crosswind of 20 kts and allowed the aircraft to stay high above glide slope during both PAR approaches, he also was not fully aware of altimeter setting (QNH or QFE) and altitude reports by flight crewÂ improper values QNH/QFE were used by the flight crew during first approach, additionally PIC has set his altimeter to QFE, while SIC to QNH. During the approach the controllerÂs instructions were hesitant and inconsistent, probably making the flight crew to believe their approach was going well. * The military PAR controller was giving improper suggestions to the flight crew - he was questioning them during final stage of approach whether they see approach or runway lights or not, instead of continuous talking them down to the runway threshold, * Altimeter indications were improperly interpreted by the flight crew, * Improperly performed search for visual contact by the flight crew during final stage of approach, * Improper, lacking weather situation analysis performed by the PIC before the flight, * The flight crew did not properly set DH/MDA (they did the same error on previous two legs before crash). Contributing factors were: * The SIC was not rated in CASA C-295 aircraft for night/IMC operations (the SIC total flight time was 800 hours including 100 hours in CASA C-295M), * The PIC has no previous experience on the accident version of CASA C-295 aircraft, (although he logged 800+ hours in another version of CASA C-295M aircraft used by Polish AF and his total flight time was 2500 hours), * Because of lack of GPS enhancement to IRS, the flight crew used Garmin GPSMAP 196 handheld GPS receiver, * The PIC had no previous experience in PAR approaches in IMC, close to minimums, which in Miroslawiec AB were reported to be aprox. ceiling 270 feet and visibility of 3300 feet, * The milSources: BBC  Polish Air Force   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The Merauke air traffic controller reported that when the aircraft was on final approach there were no obstructions on the runway, so he cleared the aircraft to land on runway 16.  During the landing roll, the pilot observed that a cow had entered the active runway and was running across the runway in front of the aircraft. When the aircraft was about 1,000 meters from the runway 16 threshold, the left engine struck the cow. The pilots stopped the aircraft on the runway and shut down the left engine.

Sabreliner N3RP was inactive since October 2007, due to extensive maintenance to repair corrosion. The pilot and co-pilot were assigned by the operator to move the airplane to its home base at Hernando County Airport (BKV), Brooksville, Florida. The maintenance facility released the Sabreliner to the pilots on February 1. The Sabreliner was located on the maintenance facility ramp in the northwest corner of Fort Lauderdale-Executive Airport. The pilot and copilot boarded the airplane, started the APU, and started both engines. About 15:40, the Sabreliner began to taxi out, and contacted the FXE ATCT ground controller to coordinate maneuvering around a Cessna Caravan that was headed in the opposite direction on the same ramp. The ground controller replied ""...don't have you in sight if you guys are in the foxtrot one ramp that is uncontrolled."" The accident crew responded that they were aware of that, but that they wanted to ""get out of the way"" of the Caravan. Ground control then asked for the accident crew's intentions, and at 15:42:04, the accident crew replied ""taxi out for departure and I'll get the clearance as soon as I get clear of the Caravan."" At 15:42:50 the Caravan pilot broadcast ""mayday mayday mayday watch out watch out watch out."" According to the pilot of the Caravan, he had deplaned his passengers and was taxiing his airplane to its parking location. Since the Sabreliner was blocking his intended path, the Caravan pilot stopped to let the Sabreliner pass. He then saw the Sabreliner coming towards him, and the left wing of the Sabreliner struck the Caravan's propeller. The Sabreliner continued moving at a speed that the Caravan pilot estimated to be 10 knots, and the right wing of the Sabreliner struck a DH-125 that was under tow by a tug. The Sabreliner continued to move forward until it struck another, stationary Sabreliner (N430MP). The Caravan pilot estimated that the accident Sabreliner had traveled 20 to 30 yards beyond the Caravan before it finally stopped.

However, the airline that used the hangar needed to house a plane. Since they had priority, the Citation was taken out of the hangar about 16:30 and moved back to the ramp area. While the airplane was on the ramp, the weather condition had turned from light snow to freezing rain. The pilot and her passenger arrived at the airport about 17:15. About 1730, the airplane's engines were started and the airplane was observed taxing. The FBO representative heard the pilot's announcements over the radio in the FBO. He also noticed the airplane was not on the taxiway, but on the grass area on the south side of the asphalt taxiway. At that time the ground was covered with snow and ice. The FBO representative noted the pilot did not activate the airport's taxi and runways lights via the common airport frequency radio channel. It was observed that the airplane taxied through a ditch, which was covered with ice and snow. The airplane's engines were heard at a high rate of power about this time. It was later discovered that the airplane's left main tire broke through the ice and became stuck in the ditch. The airplane continued on the grass area after the high engine power was heard. The FBO representative heard the pilot announce the wrong runway (runway 35) that she was planning to depart from. The FBO representative turned on the runway and taxi lights after hearing the incorrect runway announcement. The pilot later announced a change of departure from runway 35 to runway 17, while the airplane was observed back taxing on runway 26 onto taxiway ""C"". About 17:45 the airplane took off from runway 17. After takeoff, the pilot contacted the Air Traffic Controller (ATC) and reported that she was at 1,000 feet, climbing to 10,000 feet. About one minute later, the pilot declared an emergency and stated, ""We've got an attitude indicator failure"". About seven seconds later, the pilot announced over the frequency they were not certain which way they were turning. Radar contact was lost shortly after that.

The pilot reported to the control tower at Nassau that he was having problems with the landing gear and wished to continue flying while attempting to troubleshoot and apply emergency gear extension procedures. The aircraft departed the traffic area after permission was granted. According to the pilots, the aircraft continued to the west of Nassau where the emergency procedures were performed. Despite following the emergency gear extension procedures, the crew could not get the gear to extend. The crew then decided to return to Nassau. The crew landed using the emergency gear extension checklist that addressed landing with one gear not extended. The pilot reported that âdespite following the checklist,â the aircraft was not able to maintain directional control upon touchdown and this resulted in a runway excursion. The aircraft touchdown point was approximately 6,500ft from the threshold of Runway 09. Several runway lights, runway marking sign and the Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) were damaged by the aircraft on landing roll-out. The aircraft came to rest slightly to the right of Intersection Kilo (K) approximately 200 feet to the right of Runway 09.  There were no reported injuries to passengers or crew at the scene.  Probable Cause Probable cause has been determined as detachment of the right main landing gear door aft hinge attachment. (The locking wire which secures the gear door attachment bolt in place was found broken which allowed the attachment bolt to disengage. Once the bolt disengaged the aft door hinge detached from its secure position resulting in the movement of the hinge. This may have resulted in the hinge jamming the gear door resulting in the right main landing gear failure). Contributing Factors Pilot action/error has been largely attributed to the cause of this accident in that; 1. The right landing gear door position light illuminated on the Annunciator Panel. The pilot in command went outside and closed the door. Based on his admissions he did not report this defect to maintenance nor did he complete the appropriate technical log entry. (Had the pilot following the appropriate procedures for reporting mechanical irregularities this accident may have been avoided). 2. The pilot in command was in a hurry to get home. When the accident investigators arrived at the scene the PIC had already left for his next job. (Get-home-itis) (This was evidenced as the PIC by telephone called later to say he could not stay at the scene as he had to get to his other job.)Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: DCABah Report number:  Status: Preliminary reportDuration: 1 monthDownload report:  Preliminary report Sources: DCA  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates30-May-2023 20:29 harro Added 30-May-2023 20:34 harro Updated Corrections or additions? ...

The cabin of the aircraft was configured for cargo operations with no passenger seats fitted, as the only other planned occupant was the operatorÂs Chief Engineer, who would be sitting beside the commander in the right hand seat. However, the commander asked the operator if he could take a family member with him to SXM. The operator agreed and an extra seat was fitted. Witnesses stated that the commander appeared ""rushed"" prior to departure. The commander stated that he partially carried out the normal pre-flight inspection. He then started the engines. Before taxiing he realised that the nose landing gear chocks were still in place so he shut down the left hand engine, removed and stowed the chocks and then restarted the left engine. The aircraft took off from runway 10 at 14:15 hrs. At between 100 ft and 150 ft the commander initiated a left turn but after some initial movement the ailerons jammed. When he discovered that he was unable to straighten the ailerons he attempted to return to land on runway 10. The other flight controls did not appear to be restricted. With the ailerons jammed, the aircraft continued to turn to the left, losing altitude as it flew over a settlement to the north of the aerodrome, until pointed directly at the Air Traffic Control tower, causing the Air Traffic Control Officer (ATCO) to abandon the tower. The commander judged that the aircraft was too fast and high to attempt a landing and therefore initiated a go-around, applying full power. He continued the left turn, losing height and speed to position the aircraft for another approach but, as the aircraft descended over the northern edge of the runway, its left wing struck the perimeter fence. On impact the aircraft spun about its vertical axis with its wings level and continued sliding sideways on its right side for approximately 80 ft before coming to rest facing north-west. CONCLUSIONS: ""The commander was probably distracted from his normal duties whilst arranging additional seating to accommodate the second passenger. He did not complete the requisite pre-flight check or the subsequent check of full and free movement of the flight controls, either of which would have revealed an obstruction to proper operation of the ailerons.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: AAIB Bulletin 2/2009 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Vancouver International Airport, BC (YVR/CYVR); August 1993 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The weather conditions at Edinburgh Airport were wintry with snowfall, which required the aircraft to be de-iced. Shortly after both engines had been started, the commander signalled to the marshaller to remove the Ground Power Unit (GPU) from the aircraft, which was facing nose out from its stand, down a slight slope. As the marshaller went to assist his colleague to remove the GPU to a safe distance prior to the aircraft taxiing off the stand, the aircraft started to move forward slowly, forcing them to run to safety. The flight crew, who were looking into the cockpit, were unaware that the aircraft was moving. It continued to move forward until its right propeller struck the GPU, causing substantial damage to the GPU, the propeller and the engine. The ground crew were uninjured. CONCLUSION: ""The aircraft moved forward inadvertently after engine start, causing its right propeller to strike a GPU. Possible explanations include that the parking brake was not set, the chocks had slipped from the nosewheel, or the chocks were removed prematurely. There was insufficient evidence to determine which of these scenarios was the most likely. Contributory factors were: the aircraft was facing down a slight downslope, the ramp was slippery due to the weather conditions and the flight crew increased engine speed to top up the pneumatic system pressure. The airport operatorÂs instructions contained in MDD 04/07 required aircraft facing nose-out on North Cargo Apron stands to be towed onto the taxiway centreline, prior to starting engines. Had these instructions been complied with, the accident would probably have been avoided.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: AAIB Bulletin 2/2009 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  1 July 2000 G-JEAP Channel Express 0 Coventry-Baginton Airport (CVT) sub 7 May 2004 G-CEXG Channel Express 0 Bournemouth International Airport (BOH/EGHH) min Location  Images: photo (c) AAIB; Edinburgh-Turnhouse Airport (EDI); February 2008 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Around 10:59, a ground handler, stopped in a vehicle near parking area S31 to let the Boeing 777 pass, saw the fairing of the right main landing gear's nose wheel detach. The fairing fell off and rolled to the left of taxiway A. Sparks and smoke appeared from the right nose wheel of the right main landing gear. The ground handler, whose vehicle was not equipped with a radio, followed the aircraft and asked another agent to inform air traffic control services. At 11:02:59, while the aircraft was on taxiway B, the ground controller informed the crew that they had been informed about a metal part left at their parking area. The controller also instructed the crew to turn left and stop. The crew did not understand the meaning of the Ground controller's message. At 11:03:38, the SOL controller asked the crew to continue taxiing to holding point 27L and informed them that he would call them back to stop. The crew was uncertain whether they should continue taxiing to the 27L runway holding point or stop. At 11:04:11, as the aircraft turned left onto taxiway Y11 leading to the Y11 holding point of runway 27L, the SOL controller instructed the crew not to proceed to the holding point but to take the first taxiway. The PF then decided to turn onto taxiway Q. At 11:04:48, the co-pilot contacted the ground handling staff to try to gather more information. At 11:05:31, the crew of a Continental Air Lines B757, following the B777 during taxi, informed the Ground controller that a tire on one of the Boeing 777's wheels had caught fire and requested assistance from the fire brigade. They also informed the B777 crew on the Ground frequency. At 11:06:12, the captain of the Boeing 777 ordered the evacuation. The aircraft was then located on taxiway Q at Y12. The 125 passengers and crew members evacuated through the slide rafts of the eight aircraft doors. Two cabin crew members were injured during the evacuation through door 2L. The intervention of the firefighters successfully extinguished the fire. An examination of the wheel and its components was conducted by Boeing. It showed that two identical bearings had been installed in the internal and external positions on the right main landing gear's nose wheel. The wheel spindle of the Boeing 777 is conical, and the internal and external bearings are not interchangeable. The bearing installed in the external position was identified as an internal wheel bearing. It was not possible to identify how an internal bearing could have been installed in place of an external bearing.Sources: https://bea.aero/en/investigation-reports/notified-events/detail/feu-au-niveau-du-train-principal-droit-au-cours-du-roulage-vers-la-piste-evacuation-durgence/ History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  20 February 2021 N772UA United Airlines 0 near Denver International Airport (DEN/KDEN), Denver, CO min Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates02-Jun-2023 17:53 harro Added Corrections or additions? ...

The copilot was the handling pilot for the descent, approach and landing at Darwin and the pilot in command was the monitoring pilot. The crew had received a weather briefing prior to the departure from Cairns, informing them that there were showers and thunderstorms in the Darwin area for their arrival. Air traffic control (ATC) cleared the crew to conduct the Darwin runway 29 ILS approach. The monitoring pilot stated that the runway was in sight prior to flying over the Howard Springs non-directional beacon (NDB). Information from the aircraftÂs flight data recorder (FDR) indicated that the aircraft flew over the Howard Springs NDB at about 3,000 ft above mean sea level (AMSL), with a computed air speed of 221 knots. The aircraft was configured for landing at the outer marker, where the handling pilot disconnected the autopilot and the approach was flown manually by reference to the ILS and visual reference with the runway lighting. During the approach and landing, the aircraft autothrottle remained engaged. At approximately 700 ft AMSL, the aircraft entered a rain shower. The monitoring pilot switched on the windscreen wipers and, as both pilots stated that they could see the runway lighting and PAPI, the approach was continued. At approximately 30 ft radio altitude, the FDR recorded a rate of descent of approximately 1,000 ft/min at the same time as an abrupt control column nose up command was applied. The copilot recalled hearing the synthesised calls of radio altitude from the aircraftÂs radar altimeter. At 21:14:50, the aircraft touched down with a rate of descent of about 1,000 ft/min, which resulted in a hard impact with the runway prior to the 300 m runway markings. The aircraft then bounced before settling onto the runway. The crew completed the landing rollout and taxied the aircraft to the terminal. CONTRIBUTING SAFETY FACTORS: - The aircraft was above the glideslope at the Howard Springs non-directional beacon and throughout the majority of the approach, resulting in high rates of descent on several occasions as attempts were made to capture the glideslope. - The copilot disconnected the autopilot at a time of high workload. - The aircraft's rate of descent below 400 ft above aerodrome level exceeded the operatorÂs stabilised approach criteria; however, because the pilot in command considered the exceedance to be momentary, a missed approach was not conducted. - The allowance of momentary excursions in the aircraft operatorÂs stabilised approach criteria that were caused by wind gusts or turbulence increased risk by permitting flight crew discretion to continue approaches at or beyond those criteria. [Minor safety issue] - The operatorÂs procedure for the use of the autothrottle in response to high rates of descent when below 30 ft during landing was not included in the operatorÂs standard operating procedures. [Minor safety issue] - At about 30 ft, the copilot made an abrupt rearward movement of the control column resulting in the main landing gear moving faster downwards than the aircraftÂs overall rate of descent. OTHER SAFETY FACTORS: - The operatorÂs process for reporting 717 pilot training issues to senior managers was not utilised by all flight crew, reducing the potential for the communication of fleet-wide issues to all 717 crews. [Minor safety issue] - There was no clear division of responsibilities between the aircraft operator and the third party training provider in regard to ensuring the standards of flight training met all of the operatorÂs requirements, which had the potential to reduce training effectiveness. [Minor safety issue] - There was no provision in the current Civil Aviation Safety Authority regulations or orders regarding third party flight crew training providers, with the effect that the responsibility for training outcomes was unclear. [Minor safety issue] - There was no aircraft operatorÂs or manufacturerÂs 717 pilot training manual that provided for the standardisation of instructional technique and provided a reference document for pilots during and following training. [Minor safety issue] - The control column moved forward after touchdown, resulting in excessive weight transfer to the nosewheel before the right mainwheel was correctly loaded. - After touchdown, the thrust levers were advanced, inadvertently cancelling the deployment of the ground spoilers and resulting in unstable conditions while transitioning from flight to the ground. - The aircraft operator's Route Manual did not include all relevant information on the potential for visual illusions during a night approach to runway 29 at Darwin Airport that would have improved the awareness of flight crews. [Minor safety issue] - The Jeppesen-Sanderson Inc. approach chart titled Darwin, NT Australia ILS-Z or LOC-Z Rwy 29 dated 21 SEP 07 incorrectly depicted a level flight segment after the Howard Springs non-directional beacon that could have been misinterpreted by flight crews. [Minor safety issue] - The lack of runway centreline lighting reduced the available visual cues during the latter stages of the approach and landing to runway 29 at Darwin Airport.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ATSB Report number: AO-2008-007 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Qantas safety record under threat (News.com.au 12-2-2008)  ATSB Occurrence 200800641 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  2 May 2011 VH-NXE Qantas 0 Perth Airport, WA (PER/YPPH) min Location  Images: photo (c) Bill Mallinson; Perth Airport, WA (PER/YPPH); 17 October 2015 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Destination was Santiago de Los Caballeros, with nine tourists on board. On the return flight, at approximately 70 miles northwest of the Punta Cana Airport, the captain decided to fly to the La Romana Airport (the alternate airport), to refuel because he did not perform this operation at the Cibao Airport and because the fuel quantity indicator in the left tank was inoperative. He had doubts about the remaining fuel in the tanks. On the way to the alternate airport, the no.1 engine failed. The captain attempt to restart the engine but this failed. Engine no. 2 was still running. The pilot, aware that the fault that turned off engine no.1 was the lack of fuel, made the decision to land in a sugarcane field near El Prado, located in the province of El Seybo, for fear that the remaining engine would also go out, perhaps without a suitable place to land later. Given these conditions, the captain chose a segment of a lane in the middle of two cane fields, where he made the emergency landing. The surface of this trail was not totally flat. After having a landing run of about 100 feet, the nose wheel collided with a stone, breaking the nose landing gear. Directional control was lost and the aircraft turned to the left, entering a cane field. Cause: - The accident occurred due to the fact that engine # 1 was turned off due to lack of fuel and when making the emergency landing the captain could not keep the aircraft in the correct path of the selected lane for said landing.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIAA Dom.

Inouye International Airport, HI (HNL/PHNL)","East Hampton Airport, NY (HTO/KHTO)","Accident investigation report completed and information captured","Go! flight 1002 departed for its destination about 0916 Hawaii standard time. About 0930, the captain transmitted to air traffic control (ATC) that the flight was climbing through 11,700 feet to its cruise altitude of flight level (FL) 210 (approximately 21,000 feet mean sea level.) The controller acknowledged the transmission and cleared the flight to proceed to an intersection along the flight route located about 29 miles north-northwest of the destination airport, and the flight crew acknowledged. At 0933, during cruise flight, the controller repeated the navigational clearance, which the flight crew acknowledged, and the airplane turned in accordance with the clearance. At 0940, the controller instructed the flight to change radio frequencies, and there was no response. The controller continued to try to contact the flight crew multiple times but received no reply. At 0951, the airplane crossed the intersection that was its clearance limit then turned southeast toward the destination airport without descending, which is consistent with the airplane being on autopilot. The controller handling the flight asked another controller to attempt to contact the flight crew on a different frequency, but there was still no response, and the flight proceeded on a southeasterly heading at FL 210. About 0955, the flight crossed over the destination airport and continued on a southeasterly course without changing altitude or heading. Two separate airline crews in the area attempted to contact the incident crew, but neither flight crewsâ attempts were successful.  About 0958, when the flight was about 26 nautical miles southeast of the destination airport, the captain contacted the controller with an abbreviated call sign (âAh HCF ten zero twoâ), and the controller asked if the flight crew was experiencing an emergency. The captain responded, ""No, we must have missed a hand off or missed a call or something."" The controller then issued instructions for the flight to return to the destination airport, with which the flight crew complied. The flight arrived without further incident about 1015.  The captain and first officer both reported to their company that they had unintentionally fallen asleep in flight. The fact that both pilots fell asleep during the midmorning hours, a time of day normally associated with wakefulness and rising alertness, indicates that both pilots were fatigued.  The captain had undiagnosed severe obstructive sleep apnea, which was diagnosed during a medical evaluation shortly after this incident and for which symptoms (such as snoring) and risk factors (such as obesity) were present before the incident. This condition likely caused him to experience chronic daytime fatigue and contributed to his falling asleep during the incident flight.  Probable Cause: The captain and first officer inadvertently falling asleep during the cruise phase of flight. Contributing to the incident were the captain's undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea and the flight crewâs recent work schedules, which included several consecutive days of early-morning start times.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: SEA08IA080 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates23-Oct-2016 16:13 harro Added 03-Nov-2018 20:40 ASN Update Bot Updated [Time, Operator, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, Accident report, ]03-Nov-2018 20:42 harro Updated [Location, Narrative, ]09-Jun-2023 14:36 Ron Averes Updated Corrections or additions? ...

All three crew members and eighteen passengers survived the accident. The airplane arrived as flight BRU1833 from Minsk-2 International Airport (MSQ), Belarus at 02:05. Refueling was carried out in preparation for the return flight and the crew conducted the flight planning. After refueling the pilot carried out a tactile and visual inspection of all critical surfaces of the wing and visual inspection of the tail assembly. All the planes were clean and dry. The weather reported for the 04:00 was: wind 110 degrees at the ground 1 m/sec, visibility 3500 meters, haze, small clouds, vertical visibility of 800 meters, scattered clouds at 3000 m, a temperature of minus 3Â° C, dew point minus 4Â° C, pressure 1019 hPa.  At 04:08 both engines were started. The engine air intake heating (cowl anti-ice) was switched on but the wing anti-icing system was not switched on. The crew taxied to runway 27 and were cleared for departure. During takeoff the airplane progressively banked left until the left wing tip contacted runway. The airplane went off the side with the airplane rolling the right. The right hand wing broke off and spilled fuel caught fire. The airplane came to rest upside down. CONCLUSION (translated from Russian): The accident involving aircraft CRJ-100LR registration number EW-101PJ was the result of an asymmetric loss of lift of the wing during take-off, which led to the toppling of the aircraft immediately after liftoff from the runway, the left wing tip contacting the ground, the subsequent destruction and fire. The reason for the loss of lift of the wing at the actual weather conditions, was the formation of frost, which ""pollutes"" the surface of the wing. The cause of formation of frost, most likely, was the fuel icing, while the aircraft was parked at the airport and during taxiing for the return flight, resulting in a difference in temperature of the surrounding air and cold fuel in the tanks after the flight. The situation could be aggravated when exceeding the values recommended by the operations manual of the angular velocity when lifting the nose wheel during takeoff with ""contaminated"" wings when it is impossible to monitor this parameter instrumentally. Existing procedural methods of control of the aerodynamic surfaces of the aircraft before departure, along with the inefficiency, during takeoff, the existing system of protection from stalling due to increased sensitivity of the wing, even to a slight contamination of the leading edge, can not fully guarantee the prevention of similar accidents in future. An Airworthiness Directive on the need to include anti-icing systems on the wing in the final stage of taxiing at the actual weather conditions was issued by Transport Canada after the accident. This probably could have prevented the accident.Sources: MAK Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC)  Reuters  Belavia press release   Location  Images: photo (c) Interstate Aviation Committee; Yerevan-Zvartnots Airport (EVN); February 2008 photo (c) Interstate Aviation Committee; Yerevan-Zvartnots Airport (EVN); February 2008 photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG/LFPG); January 2008 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

I inquired if she could still perform her duties, at which point she said that she could not. I proceeded to call dispatch and notified him of the incident and told him that we would return to the airport and he concurred. I requested medical assistance and after [I] did a passenger briefing about the incident and that we were returning to CVG."" According to the Flight Attendant, she got out of her jumpseat after 10,000 feet to begin service. As she proceeded to the galley, she slipped and fell. The flight attendant said there was glycol on the floor, and she must have slipped on it. She had difficulty getting up. A passenger seated in 2A was able to assist her into seat 1A. Another passenger came forward and identified himself as a family physician and offered assistance. He had her apply ice to her ankle and got the interphone for her so she could notify the Captain. The flight attendant informed the Captain that she could not continue to work the flight. The captain made the decision to turn around and go back to CVG instead of continuing onto GSP. The captain made an announcement advising the passengers that she was injured and unable to continue and they would be returning to CVG.  After landing, the Emergency Medical Service met the aircraft and carried her off the airplane. The passengers then deplaned back into the terminal. At the hospital, the flight attendant said the doctor informed her that her leg was broken in three places.

The copilot gave his place on board to a passenger without any qualification to operate the aircraft, moments after takeoff. During the en-route flight phase, the secondary pitch trim system was activated, which would have resulted in an abnormal operation of the system, followed by violent loss of altitude and over speed condition. Possible Causes: Absence of Crew Coordination and disregard of the Co-pilot's command post responsibilities. * The flight was performed, at least during the last 32 minutes, by the pilot in command with the aircraft passenger in the co-pilot's seat. In this condition, it does not comply with RAV 60.2(a) and 60.10 (b), (e) and (d). In these circumstances, it was not possible to effectively perform emergency procedures for this condition, since the passenger was not capable of performing them. - Conscious modification of flight conditions. - The aircraft was in cruise, straight and level flight. The condition was altered by the actuation of the Secondary Trim Switch, which was not required for this flight condition, since this is an Emergency Trim System, in case the Primary System, presents a failure. - Abnormal operation of the Horizontal Stabilizer Pitch Trim System. - When the Horizontal Stabilizer Pitch Trim Secondary System double switch was actuated, it triggered an abnormal operation of the aircraft's horizontal stabilizer trim system with runaway characteristics (Trim Runaway) and almost immediately caused an over-speed condition. This failure, which could have been of an electrical or mechanical nature, could not be solved according to the emergency procedures that could have been executed, as described in the AFM section 111, which inhibited the recovery of the aircraft and caused the impact against the ground with high speed and thrust.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JIAAC Venezuela Report number: 010/2008 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: NotiSAR  Report A-149/CENIPA/2015   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The captain said he broke out of the cloud base about 1,200 feet msl, 7 miles from the runway. He said he was holding about 15 to 20 degrees of left crab to remain aligned with the runway centerline, and he felt a strong crosswind over the runway threshold. During the landing flare, the left wingtip fuel tank contacted the runway. The captain applied full right aileron and full right rudder, and the airplane touched down on the centerline. After parking, an inspection of the left wingtip fuel tank revealed scraping and flattening of about the aft third of the underside of the fuel tank. The upper surface of the wing, inboard from the tip tank, was wrinkled. The automated weather observing system (AWOS) was reporting, in part:  Wind, 270 degrees at 5 knots; visibility, 9 statute miles; clouds and sky condition, 1,200 feet overcast. The FAA Facility Directory/Alaska Supplement notes that ""Because of natural obstructions, the AWOS-3 wind may be unrepresentative of runway wind conditions."" The captain indicated that the landing approach speed was flown with additional airspeed to compensate for the wind conditions, and he noted that he could only assume that windshear contributed to the accident. Probable Cause: The captain's inadequate compensation for wind conditions during the landing flare/touchdown. Contributing to the accident were a crosswind and windshear.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ANC08LA035 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB ANC08LA035  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates03-Oct-2022 08:21 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

All 46 on board were killed. MÃ©rida Airport is located in a mountain valley at an elevation of 5010 feet. Terrain in the valley rises from 1000 to 19.500 feet. Arrivals and departures have to use the Rio Chama corridor to the west of the airport. Runway 07 is used for landings and takeoffs have to be performed in the opposite direction, from runway 25.  Santa BÃ¡rbara Airlines however used an unpublished approach and departure procedure which let the aircraft use a valley to the northeast of the airport. This procedure saved about 15 minutes of flying time on the route to Caracas. After all passengers had boarded for flight 518 to Caracas, it took about 30 minutes for the pilots to arrive at the aircraft. Being late, they immediately started the engines while simultaneously asking for permission to do so. Because an Avior Airlines flight was approaching the airport, the crew were told to expedite their departure or wait for the arrival of the Avior aircraft. The flight crew decided to go and began taxiing 2 minutes and 40 seconds after startup. Consequently the AHRS (attitude and heading reference) system of the airplane was unusable. The aircraft needed to remain still for 3 minutes after the battery is turned on so that all gyroscopes, accelerometers and magnetometers can be stabilized and synchronized. The AHRS provides attitude information for aircraft, including roll, pitch and yaw. The captain possibly expected to re-initialize the system while they were at cruising altitude. After departure from runway 25 the crew planned to use the unpublished procedure. Climbing through clouds a 180-degree turn was initiated. Using the unreliable magnetic compass, the flight made a 270 degree turn, heading towards rising terrain. The captain took over control from the copilot. When visual contact with terrain was regained, the crew noted they were heading for mountains. The captain tried to avoid rising terrain but the aircraft impacted the side of a mountain at 3810 m. CONCLUSIONS The attitude and heading reference system (AHRS) as a device was operational, however the initialization of the system was incomplete, so the standard mode was in a fault condition. This failure mode left the RMI or radio magnetic indicators and the autopilot inoperative.  The EGPWS or enhanced ground proximity warning system was inoperative in the ""enhanced"" functions, since the information is displayed on the EFIS system screens, therefore there was no early warning (Visual) of impact against the mountain range. The GPS was the only instrument capable of providing heading information to within one degree of accuracy. Because it is located on the co-pilot's lower left panel, the information provided by the co-pilot was basically available for co-pilot observation. In addition, the size of the display is relatively small for the information it shows. The crew was valid, qualified and certified by the National Institute of Civil Aeronautics (INAC). However, the crew was very unconcerned to learn that they were taking off with the AHRS system inoperative and the weather conditions were instrument or IMC. The meteorological station in Merida was inoperative. The control tower did not have an operational communications recording system. According to the deformation shown on the low pressure compressor wheels, the engines had power at the time of impact.METAR: 21:00 UTC / 17:00 local time: SVMD 212100Z 29008KT 9999 SCT013 BKN100 XX/XX Q1018=22:00 UTC / 18:00 local time: SVMD 212200Z 25005KT 9999 BKN013 OVC100 20/12 Q1021=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JIAAC Venezuela Report number: 11-013/2008 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: LAGAD Aviation  NotiSAR  Instituto Nacional de AeronÃ¡utica Civil (INAC) History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  4 April 1993 N422MQ Simmons Airlines Chicago, IL min Location  Images: photo (c) Google Earth; MÃ©rida-A Carnevalli Airport (MRD/SVMD) photo (c) Ulrich F.

The airplane was registered to the Southwest Orthopedic and Sports Medicine Clinic and operated by Interstate Helicopters. At the time of the accident, Interstate Helicopters was operating the accident airplane in commercial service contrary to its Federal Aviation Administration-issued 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135 operating certificate, which, at the time, did not authorize operation of the accident airplane or any other fixed-wing aircraft.

While in the airspace near the Lake Overholser dam the airplane started a steep descent. The airplane impacted wooded terrain approximately one mile south of the dam. There were no reported radio calls of distress from the flight crew.

There were seven people on board; two pilots, two engineers, and three flight officers. The pilots reported that the approach and landing were normal. However, both Beta lights did not illuminate during the landing roll, so they could not use reverse thrust. The crew used maximum brakes to slow the aircraft, and rolled through to the end of runway 15. During the 180-degree right turn at the end of the runway, they felt the left brakes grabbing, and had to use increased thrust on the left engine to assist the turn. After completing the turn, the pilots backtracked the aircraft towards taxiway E, about 450 meters from the departure end of runway 15. The air traffic controller informed the Transall crew that heavy smoke was coming from the left main wheels, and that they should proceed to taxiway E and stop on the taxiway. Before the aircraft entered taxiway E, the controller activated the crash alarm. The pilots stopped the aircraft on taxiway E, and the occupants disembarked and attempted to extinguish the wheel-bay fire with a hand held extinguisher. The airport rescue fire fighting service (RFFS) arrived at the aircraft 10 minutes after the aircraft came to a stop on taxiway E. It took a further 5 minutes to commence applying foam. The attempts to extinguish the fire were unsuccessful, and the fire destroyed the aircraft and its cargo of fuel in drums. CAUSES: ""The aircraft's left main wheels' brakes overheated during the landing roll and a fire commenced in the brake assembly of one or more of the left main landing gear wheels.  The evidence indicated that a brake cylinder and/or hydraulic line may have failed. It is likely that brake system hydraulic fluid under pressure, was the propellant that fed the fire.  There was no Emergency Response Plan at Wamena.

The airplane operated on AdamAir flight KI292 from Jakarta.  Prior to descent, the flight crew received weather information indicating that the weather at their destination, Batam Airport, was fine. At 03:02 UTC the flight crew contacted the Batam Tower controller and were informed that the visibility was 1,000 meters and they were sequence number three for landing runway 04. The controller subsequently informed flight 292 that a preceding aircraft had the runway in sight at an altitude of about 500 feet and reported that the wind was 360 degrees at 8 knots with heavy rain.  The flight crew configured the aircraft for landing, using flaps 40 degrees. The flight crew were able to see the runway prior to the Decision Altitude (DA), however the PIC was convinced that continuing the approach to landing was unsafe and elected to go around. At 03:19 UTC, flight 292 was again established on the localizer runway 04, and the Tower controller informed them that the visibility had improved to 2,000 meters. While on final approach, the flight crew reported that the runway was in sight and they received landing clearance. During the landing roll, as the groundspeed decreased below 30 knots, the aircraft yawed to the right. The flight crew attempted to steer the aircraft back to centerline by applying full left rudder. The aircraft continued yaw to the right and came to stop on the runway shoulder at approximately 40 meters from the right side of the runway edge, and 2,760 meters from the runway 04 threshold. No one was injured in this accident. The aircraft was seriously damaged with the right main landing gear assembly detached and collapsing backward and damaging the right wing and flaps. The right engine was displaced from its attachment point.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSC Report number: KNKT.08.03.05.04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: Adam Air 737 skids off runway at Batam (Flightglobal 10-3-2008)  Ministry of Transport statement   Location  Images: photo (c) RenÃ© Verschuur; Jakarta-Soekarno-Hatta International Airport (CGK/WIII); 13 August 2007 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates15-Mar-2024 19:52 ASN Updated [Accident report, ]15-Mar-2024 19:52 ASN Updated The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

It did not arrive at Bebi Airstrip and was declared missing.  On August 30, 2008, hunters found the wreckage in thick rain forest in Obanliku local government area. Investigation revealed that the Enugu tower controller issued descent instructions to 5, 000 feet AMSL (FL50) outside its control airspace not considering that the aircraft was not flying the filed flight plan route and the minimum safe altitude (MSA) of the area reported by Jeppesen charts as 11,200 feet. Causal Factor: I. The flight crew conducted an approach into a VFR airfield in an instrument meteorological condition and did not maintain terrain clearance and minimum safe altitude which led to Controlled Flight Into Terrain. II. The crew did not respond promptly to GPWS warning. Contributory Factors 1. The flight crew was not familiar with the route in a situation of low clouds, poor visibility and mountainous terrain. 2. The Area Controllers did not detect the estimate as passed by the pilot for positions not in the filed flight plan (LIPAR and LUNDO) and omitting ENUGU. 3.

There were no injuries among the 24 passengers and three crew members. Cirrus Airlines Flight 1567 departed Berlin-Tempelhof Airport (THF) at 16:30 on a domestic service to Mannheim Airport (MHG). The copilot was Pilot Flying (PF). During the flight the copilot commented that he had difficulties in landing at Mannheim. The captain replied that he did fine. At 17:36 the flight was cleared for a LOC/DME approach to runway 27. One minute later the flight reached the prescribed altitude of 5000 feet. The descent was continued until the PF noticed his error. The captain instructed the PF to arrest the descent and climb back towards 5000 feet. By then the flight had descended to 3800 feet, 100 feet below the Minimum Sector Altitude (MSA). After reaching the Final Approach Fix at 5000 feet, the crew reported that they were established on the localizer. Langen Radar instructed the flight to contact Mannheim Tower.  The airplane was configured for the final approach and landing, with the captain telling the PF not to worry several times. The PF attempted to flare the airplane for landing, but the aircraft floated over the runway without touching down. The PF then stated: ""Oh - your control"". The captain took over control and replied ""My control"". At that moment the airplane was 200 m past the runway threshold. Touchdown was accomplished at 530 m, with 480 m of runway remaining. The airplane failed to decelerate as expected and the captain called for manual braking action. The airplane overran the runway end at a speed of 50 knots. The left hand main gear collapsed as it hit a pothole. The aircraft then slid into an earthen wall and came to rest. There was no fire. Overran runway on landing and hit an earthen wall. One wing and engine severely damaged. CAUSES: The accident happened because: - The aircraft overran the end of the runway and collided with an embankment, - No go-around (balked landing) was initiated, - The throttle, after placement by the PIC (PF), could not be moved into ""ground idle"" or reverse, - The landing was not aborted after the plane had flown over the touchdown zone, - During the flare for landing the throttles of the engines were not selected to ""Flight Idle"", which was not noted by both pilots, - The flight crew flew the approach not in accordance with SOPs, and thereby pushing and even exceeding the limits. The following factors contributed to the accident: - Many non-precision approaches and landings at Mannheim City were not performed according to air carriers OMs, - The TRs and FOIs of the aircraft manufacturer were not incorporated into the OM/B and D of the air carrier, - The practical training of the flight crew by the air carrier was inadequate in terms of preventing an erroneous operation of the throttle control on the basis of the manufacturer of the Do 328-100 issued instructions, - The flight crew conducted a non-precision approach, which did not meet the procedural requirements of the OM of the air carrier and the AIP, - The design of the power lever was not forgiving enough, - The risks of existing problems in the operation of the power levers were not correctly identified and eliminated by by the relevant authorities and the relevant type certificate holder, in spite of several relevant events and various safety recommendations, - The touchdown zone in Mannheim was not marked, - The size and design of the safety area at the end of runway 27 was not sufficient to guarantee the operation of the flight within the safety levels set by ICAO and the legislator.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BFU Report number: BFU 1X001-08 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   Cirrus Airlines press release 19.03.2008   Location  Images: photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; MÃ¼nchen-Franz Josef Strauss Airport (MUC/EDDM); February 2007 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight from Madinah and the landing at Dhaka was uneventful. During the landing roll, approximately 50 seconds after touchdown, the flight crew received a call from the tower controller where the tower controller inquired whether the aircraft was under control. The flight crew responded to the call by stating that the aircraft was completely under control and asked what the problem seemed to be. The controller then informed the flight crew that fire was observed at the right wing area. At this point the Aerodrome Fire Operator had already activated the fire fighters as well as the rescue team. As soon as the controller had informed the flight crew about the fire, the flight crew received a No. 3 engine fire alarm. The co-pilot immediately discharged the first engine fire bottle and the flight crew requested fire fighter assistance and shut down all engines. The co-pilot waited 20 seconds until the second fire bottle was discharged. At this time the commander called the senior cabin attendant to the flight deck using the public address system (PA). This command was followed by a command to the cabin crew to remain seated. The commander informed the senior cabin attendant of the situation and instructed him to evaluate the situation and to evacuate the passengers if necessary. The senior cabin attendant went back down to the main deck and saw the smoke and the fire through the windows. He then commanded the cabin crew as well as passengers, by using a megaphone, to evacuate the aircraft. The cabin attendant at location L2 had already operated the emergency exit and started evacuating the passengers. Cabin attendants at locations L1 and R2 also operated their respective emergency exits. After realizing that smoke and fire were at the right hand side, the emergency exit at R2 was blocked by one of the cabin attendants. All passengers managed to evacuate without serious injuries and the fire department at Zia International Airport managed to extinguish the fire successfully. The damage to the aircraft was later evaluated as beyond economical repair. Findings as to causes and contributing factors - Incorrect assembly of the flexible half coupling at the front spar of engine No. 3. - Retaining ring missing in flexible half coupling at the front spar engine No. 3. - Lock wire fastened in such a way that the coupling nut might rotate slightly.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: RNF Report number: M-01508/AIG-04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) Harro Ranter; ZÃ¼rich-Kloten Airport (ZRH/LSZH); 30 August 1996 photo (c) Dale Coleman; Manchester Airport (MAN/EGCC); 08 May 2005 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The commander called for start at 14:17 and, at 14:20, was cleared to taxi to holding point A1 for a departure from runway 21. At 14:24, ATC instructed the crew to hold at A1 and cleared them for a LYDD 2 departure. At 14:34, one minute after becoming airborne, the co-pilot transmitted: ""And victor papa bravo golf echo er weÂre making an immediate turn to return to the airport immediate turn to the airport."" The tower controller replied: ""Victor golf echo join downwind right-hand runway two one, the biggin qnh one thousand, threshold elevationÂs five one seven feet, whatÂs the nature of your problem?"" The co-pilot replied: ""ere we donÂt know sir weÂre getting er engine vibration weÂll come straight back."" The aircraft then manoeuvred to overhead the airfield at approximately 1,200 ft aal heading towards the end of the downwind leg for a left-hand circuit to runway 21. As the aircraft left the overhead it commenced a continuous descent and, at 13:36 hrs, the co-pilot transmitted: ""And er victor golf echo we have major problem a major power problem it looks as though weÂre er going in weÂre going in!"" The aircraft flew extremely low over the roofs of several houses before its left wing impacted the roof of a house at the end of a residential close adjacent to a small wood. After the initial impact the aircraft struck the ground and caught fire destroying the attached garage of a neighbouring dwelling. Examination of the wreckage, however, did not reveal any evidence of pre-impact restrictions in the flight control circuits and examination of the engines, after disassembly, revealed no evidence of either engine having suffered a bird strike or foreign object damage. Furthermore, no pre-impact damage or failures were found in any of the rotating assemblies or main bearings. CONTRIBUTORY FACTORS: 1. It is probable that a mechanical failure within the air cycle machine caused the vibration which led to the crew attempting to return to the departure airfield. 2. A missing rivet head on the left engine fuel shut-off lever may have led to an inadvertent shut-down of that engine. 3. Approximately 70 seconds prior to impact neither engine was producing any thrust. 4. A relight attempt on the second engine was probably started before the relit first engine had reached idle speed, resulting in insufficient time for enough thrust to be developed to arrest the aircraftÂs rate of descent before ground impact.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: AAR 3/2010 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   AAIB Special Bulletin S2/2008  BBC News   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Kennedy International Airport (JFK),  New York.  The copilot (CP) was flying and air traffic control (ATC) was vectoring the airplane for an approach to a 10,000-foot long, 150-foot-wide runway, when an amber abnormal indicator light illuminated on the engine indicating and crew alert system (EICAS), indicating the hydraulic fluid on system A was low. The pilot-in-command (PIC) and the CP completed the checklist procedures down to the blow down of the landing gear. The flight crew did not follow the checklist sequence, and they did not evaluate the hydraulic pump to see if the hydraulic pump pressure could be restored. The flight crew turned on the A side pump, the power transfer unit was engaged, and the landing gear was lowered. The flight crew did not inform ATC of the loss of hydraulic fluid. The airplane touched down on the first 1,000 feet of runway 13L, and the CP informed the PIC that the brakes were not working. The PIC activated the emergency brakes one time, which appeared to work. The CP did not report any problems with nose wheel steering. The CP applied reverse thrust and the arm extend light illuminated on the right thrust reverser. The airplane started veering to the right and the CP could not maintain directional control. The PIC continued pulling the emergency brake handle as the airplane went off the right side of the runway, sheared off the left main landing gear, and came to a complete stop. Download of the EICAS system revealed the CP did not take the right thrust reverser out of reverse thrust. Review of airplane logbooks revealed the left hydraulic reservoir installed in the airplane was a repaired unit. The unit had been removed from another airplane due to an EICAS message stating it was empty when it was full. The switch was found to be out of adjustment. The unit was inspected and no anomalies were noted. Probable Cause: The co-pilot's failure to maintain directional control during the landing roll. Contributing to the accident was a loss of system A hydraulic fluid for undetermined reasons and the flight crew's failure to follow the checklist sequence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were no injuries to the two crew and to the one passenger who was seated behind the fuel drums in the rear of the aircraft. The area was described as treeless and featureless. A few weeks after the mishap a helicopter arrived to transport the plane back to a location more suitable for repairs. At a height of about 300 m the helicopter's sling broke. The Twin Otter fell down and was damaged beyond repair as a result.Sources: CADORS Number: 2008A0433 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  21 August 1999 C-FIZD First Air 0 Contwoyto Lake, NT sub 21 August 1999 C-FIZD First Air (Bradley Scheduled) Ltd. 0 Contwoyto Lake sub 6 November 2006 C-FIZD Provincial Airlines 0 Goose Bay Airport, NL (YYR) sub Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

On takeoff, the crew was given a clearance to a 150-degree heading and a climb to 10,000 feet mean sea level (msl).  The takeoff was normal and in accordance with company procedures.  Approximately 2 minutes after takeoff and passing through 8,000 feet msl and 230 knots, the crew noticed ""large white birds.""  Immediately thereafter, the airplane impacted the birds.  ""At first there was a loud bang, followed by a moderately loud wind noise.""  The crew realized at least one bird had penetrated into the cockpit; they declared an emergency and requested to return to the airport.  After verifying aircraft control, the crew maneuvered back to the airport.  The airplane landed uneventfully and taxied to a ramp.  Examination of the airframe revealed a hole in the aircraft's forward fuselage below the cockpit windows.  The fuselage skin and forward pressure bulkhead were penetrated and contained bird matter.  Bird matter was noted on the cockpit windows, fuselage, vertical and horizontal stabilizers, and in the left engine.  The left engine fan blades were damaged and the spinner was buckled and collapsed.  The bird remains were identified as American White Pelican (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos), and the average mass for the bird is approximately 7,000 grams (15.4 pounds).  At the time of the accident, the United States Air Force Bird Avoidance Model risk class was moderate for the local area.

It became airborne at 23:23 and shortly afterwards the pilot had been instructed to transfer to the departures controllerÂs radio frequency.  On first radio contact with that controller, the pilot was advised that the aircraft was identified on radar. At 23:25:30, the controller instructed the pilot to turn left onto a heading of 090 degrees, which was acknowledged. Instead of the expected left turn, the radar returns indicated that the aircraft was turning right, towards the south-west. At 23:25:54, the controller confirmed with the pilot that he was to turn left and at 23:25:59 the pilot once again acknowledged the left turn and added ""IÂve got a slight technical fault here"". No further transmissions were received from the pilot. The radar returns over the next 70 seconds showed the aircraft completed a left turn followed by a right turn before disappearing from radar. The Metro crashed into the sea.  On 12 May 2008, a significant wreckage field was identified. That wreckage was spread over an area approximately 1,200 m long and 400 m wide. CONTRIBUTING SAFETY FACTORS: - It was very likely that the aircraftÂs alternating current electrical power system was not energised at any time during the flight. - It was very likely that the aircraft became airborne without a functioning primary attitude reference or autopilot that, combined with the added workload of managing the Âslight technical faultÂ, led to pilot spatial disorientation and subsequent loss of control. OTHER SAFETY FACTORS: - The pilotÂs Metro III endorsement training was not conducted in accordance with the operatorÂs approved training and checking manual, with the result that the pilotÂs competence and ultimately, safety of the operation could not be assured. [Significant safety issue] - The chief pilot was performing the duties and responsibilities of several key positions in the operatorÂs organisational structure, increasing the risk of omissions in the operatorÂs training and checking requirements. - The conduct of the flight single-pilot increased the risk of errors of omission, such as not turning on or noticing the failure of aircraft items and systems, or complying with directions.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ATSB Report number: AO-2008-026 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: ATSB AO-2008-026   Location  Images: photo (c) ATSB; Sydney-Kingsford Smith International Airport, NSW (SYD); 09 April 2008 photo (c) ATSB; off Sydney-Kingsford Smith International Airport, NSW (SYD) photo (c) ATSB; off Sydney-Kingsford Smith International Airport, NSW (SYD) photo (c) ATSB photo (c) ATSB photo (c) ATSB photo (c) ATSB photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Sydney-Kingsford Smith International Airport, NSW (SYD/YSSY); April 2000 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The commercial pilot and three passengers were not injured. The personal flight departed from Lincoln Regional Airport, California, about 08:54, with a planned destination of Carlsbad. At the time of the accident, the pilot had canceled his instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan, and was executing a visual flight rules (VFR) approach to runway 24 in visual meteorological conditions.  As the airplane approached the destination airport, the pilot selected vertical speed mode on the autopilot. While descending, the copilot's Primary Flight Display (PFD) began to flicker. About 5 minutes later, as the airplane transitioned through 28,000 feet mean sea level, the left PFD flashed a ""PFT"" alert indicating that the autopilot had disconnected. The pilot said he immediately felt heavy control forces on the control yoke that he had to exert to fly the airplane. Shortly thereafter, the pilot discovered that the electric pitch trim was not operational. While hand-flying the airplane the pilot entered instrument meteorological conditions as the airplane descended through a 2,400-foot-thick cloud layer. Thereafter, the pilot continued a visual approach to the 4,897-foot-long runway. The pilot noted that he was overwhelmed with the electrical failures and fatigued from maneuvering the airplane by hand for such a long duration (which he approximated was around 45 minutes). The airplane crossed the runway threshold about 15 knots faster than the correct landing speed and the airplane touched down past the midpoint of the runway. The pilot realized that despite his braking attempts the airplane was going to continue off the runway surface over a small downsloping cliff at the end. He determined that he would not be able to abort the landing due to the airplane's diminished ground speed and elected to perform a 180-degree turn. The airplane ground looped, coming to rest in a dirt area south of the runway; the main landing gear collapsed and the flaps folded under the wings. According to the pilot, he never attempted to reset the autopilot system. The autopilot was designed for an automatic disengagement when there is a system failure, invalid sensor data, or yaw damper failure. On the manufacturer's current Pilots' Abbreviated Checklist, Emergency Procedures section, it states that if the autopilot preflight test fail warning (red ""PFT"" warning on the PFD) illuminates, the pilot should reset the associated circuit breaker to clear the fault. A post-accident examination of the airplane's systems revealed no mechanical malfunctions or failures, with the exception of a flickering PFD screen.

Four crew members and seven passengers sustained serious injuries. Iran Air Flight IR235 was a scheduled service from Tehran to Shiraz. The co-pilot, who was Pilot Flying, performed a walk around prior to departure. Since it had been snowing and temperatures were around freezing level, he requested de-icing. Because there were a number of aircraft already waiting for de-icing, the pilot in command decided not to perform de-icing. The engines were started and the airplane started taxying towards the departure runway at 07:09 hours. At 07:31 the flight was cleared for takeoff. The aircraft rolled left wing down shortly after lift off. The left wingtip touched the ground. Thereafter the aircraft rolled momentarily back to a more neutral position. A few seconds later, while losing altitude, the second left wing down roll started. The left wing touched the ground and when the aircraft rolled back to a more neutral attitude both main landing gears touched the ground. All gears broke off and the aircraft slid on the area next to the runway. Reportedly, during the impact or shortly thereafter all electrical power was lost. When the aircraft came to rest, a fire developed, starting from the left wing root towards the fuselage. All passengers and crew were evacuated through the two right over wing emergency exits. Cause: It is believed that the accident was caused by the crew fault that has not decided to de-ice aircraft, which led to wing contamination and finally aircraft has stalled during take off. Contributing causes:   a)  Weak cockpit resource management  b)  Weak management for cold Weather operation of Iran Air.Sources: IRNA   Location  Images: photo (c) Shekkar; Tehran-Mehrabad Airport (THR/OIII); 02 January 2008 photo (c) Shekkar; Tehran-Mehrabad Airport (THR/OIII); 02 January 2008 photo (c) Shekkar; Tehran-Mehrabad Airport (THR/OIII); 02 January 2008 photo (c) Shekkar; Tehran-Mehrabad Airport (THR/OIII); 02 January 2008 photo (c) Shekkar; Tehran-Mehrabad Airport (THR/OIII); 02 January 2008 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot, co-pilot, 3 flight attendants, and 68 passengers on board were not injured. The airplane received substantial damage. The flight originated from New York-LaGuardia Airport (LGA), at 06:18. The accident flight was the first one for the airplane after having maintenance performed on the number two (right) engine during the previous evening. The first officer reported he used a flashlight when conducting his preflight inspection of the airplane as it was still dark outside. He reported the engine cowlings were flush, and he did not see any ""hanging"" cowl latches when he looked underneath the engines. The captain reported that the logbooks indicated the number two engine vibration monitor had been replaced during the previous night. He reported the preflight, taxi, and takeoff were normal. The captain reported that during climb out the cockpit received a call from the lead flight attendant who informed them that a passenger reported that the number two engine cowling was flapping after takeoff. A pilot-passenger who was sitting behind this passenger reportedly did not see the cowling move, nor did the flight attendants when they looked out the window. The captain reported he then began to monitor the N1 vibration indications on the number two engine. He reported that the number two engine vibration was approximately double the indication from the number one engine, but the indicator was not flashing nor had it turned amber. During cruise flight the number two engine vibration decreased to equal that of the number one engine. The captain reported that about 20 minutes after they leveled off, the airplane shuddered as if flying through wake turbulence. He reported the remainder of the flight was normal until they were taxiing after landing and the lead flight attendant called the cockpit stating that ""part of the right engine had come off."" The first officer called ground control to warn them that there might be debris on the runway. The crew then shut down the number two engine and taxied to the gate.  The pilot of another airplane later reported seeing part of the engine cowling come off when flight 853 was on a 1-mile final. The other half of the engine cowling was found on the runway and was contacted by an airplane that landed after the accident airplane.  Contract maintenance personnel reported they changed the N1 sensor on the number two engine during the evening prior to the accident. They reported they then shut the fan cowling, but did not latch it as they still needed to perform an engine run and check for leaks. After the engine run was performed, one of the mechanics thought that the other had latched the fan cowling when in fact he had not. While they were doing another task in the cockpit, another mechanic asked for help at another gate. The mechanics left the accident airplane to assist the other mechanic. Neither mechanic returned to the accident airplane to either latch or verify that the fan cowling had been latched.  The maintenance log stated the N1 speed sensor was removed and replaced in accordance with aircraft maintenance manual (AMM) 77-11-10. This section of the AMM states, ""Close the fan cowl doors (Ref. AMM TASK 71-13-00-410-040)."" According to the maintenance personnel, this task was not completed prior to the airplane being returned to service.  The separated cowling contacted the right side of the horizontal stabilizer which resulted in substantial damage to the stabilizer. In addition, the fan cowl doors, number two engine pylon, the number two engine reverser, and the right wing number one slat were damaged. The separation of the engine cowling which resulted from maintenance personnel failing to follow maintenance procedures in that they did not latch the engine cowling following the maintenance inspection.  A factor associated with the accident was their attention was divereted from the task when another mechanic asked for assistance.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CHI08LA071 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

It was scheduled to arrive at Lihue at 05:15. The pilot had routine contact with air traffic control, and was advised by the controller to maintain 6,000 feet at 05:01 when the airplane was 11 miles from the destination airport. Two minutes later the flight was cleared for a visual approach to follow a preceding Boeing 737 (Aloha Airlines Flight 917) and advised to switch to the common traffic advisory frequency at the airport. The pilot altered his flight course to the west, most likely for spacing from the airplane ahead, and descended into the water as he began a turn back toward the airport. The majority of the wreckage sank in 4,800 feet of water. The pilot most likely descended into the ocean because he became spatially disoriented. Although visual meteorological conditions prevailed, no natural horizon and few external visual references were available during the visual approach. This increased the importance of monitoring flight instruments to maintain awareness of the airplane attitude and altitude. The pilot's tasks during the approach, however, included maintaining visual separation from the airplane ahead and lining up with the destination runway. These tasks required visual attention outside the cockpit. These competing tasks probably created shifting visual frames of reference, left the pilot vulnerable to common visual and vestibular illusions, and reduced his awareness of the airplane's attitude, altitude and trajectory. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The pilot's spatial disorientation and loss of situational awareness. Contributing to the accident were the dark night and the task requirements of simultaneously monitoring the cockpit instruments and the other airplane.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: SEA08FA062 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   NTSB  FAA   Location  Images: photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; San Francisco International Airport, CA (SFO/KSFO); September 1993 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Instead, the airplane touched down in a snow-covered area of the airport between the runway and the adjacent taxiway. The pilot said that blowing snow and flat lighting conditions contributed to his difficulty in discerning the correct location of the runway. He said he ""aimed for the darker area between the runway and the taxiway, believing this was the runway."" The director of operations for the operator said that the depression between the runway and the taxiway had been filled with snow by runway maintenance personnel during snow removal operations. He indicated that the area had the illusion of a hard surface, but landing during reduced visibility due to blowing snow required the pilot to take advantage of any and all available resources, such as requesting the activation of the runway lights, and/or using the instrument landing system (ILS) localizer as a means of aligning the airplane with the centerline of the runway. Probable Cause: The pilot's selection of unsuitable terrain for landing.

Initially the approach progressed normally, with the Autopilot and Autothrottle engaged, until the aircraft was at a height of approximately 600 ft and 2 miles from touch down. The aircraft then descended rapidly and struck the ground, some 1,000 ft short of the paved runway surface, just inside the airfield boundary fence. The aircraft stopped on the very beginning of the paved surface of runway 27L. During the short ground roll the right main landing gear separated from the wing and the left main landing gear was pushed up through the wing root. A significant amount of fuel leaked from the aircraft but there was no fire. An emergency evacuation via the slides was supervised by the cabin crew and all occupants left the aircraft, some receiving minor injuries. Initial indications from the interviews and Flight Recorder analyses show the flight and approach to have progressed normally until the aircraft was established on late finals for runway 27L. At approximately 600 ft and 2 miles from touch down, the Autothrottle demanded an increase in thrust from the two engines but the engines did not respond. Following further demands for increased thrust from the Autothrottle, and subsequently the flight crew moving the throttle levers, the engines similarly failed to respond. The aircraft speed reduced and the aircraft descended onto the grass short of the paved runway surface. CAUSAL FACTORS: Whilst on approach to London (Heathrow) from Beijing, China, at 720 feet agl, the right engine of G-YMMM ceased responding to autothrottle commands for increased power and instead the power reduced to 1.03 Engine Pressure Ratio (EPR). Seven seconds later the left engine power reduced to 1.02 EPR. This reduction led to a loss of airspeed and the aircraft touching down some 330 m short of the paved surface of Runway 27L at London Heathrow. The investigation identified that the reduction in thrust was due to restricted fuel flow to both engines. It was determined that this restriction occurred on the right engine at its FOHE. For the left engine, the investigation concluded that the restriction most likely occurred at its FOHE. However, due to limitations in available recorded data, it was not possible totally to eliminate the possibility of a restriction elsewhere in the fuel system, although the testing and data mining activity carried out for this investigation suggested that this was very unlikely. Further, the likelihood of a separate restriction mechanism occurring within seven seconds of that for the right engine was determined to be very low. The investigation identified the following probable causal factors that led to the fuel flow restrictions: 1) Accreted ice from within the fuel system released, causing a restriction to the engine fuel flow at the face of the FOHE, on both of the engines. 2) Ice had formed within the fuel system, from water that occurred naturally in the fuel, whilst the aircraft operated with low fuel flows over a long period and the localised fuel temperatures were in an area described as the Âsticky rangeÂ. 3) The FOHE, although compliant with the applicable certification requirements, was shown to be susceptible to restriction when presented with soft ice in a high concentration, with a fuel temperature that is below -10Â°C and a fuel flow above flight idle. 4) Certification requirements, with which the aircraft and engine fuel systems had to comply, did not take account of this phenomenon as the risk was unrecognised at that time.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: AAIB Report  1/2010 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) Marc-Antony Payne; London-Heathrow Airport (LHR/EGLL); 17 January 2008; (CC:by) photo (c) unknown; London-Heathrow Airport (LHR/EGLL); May 2008 photo (c) Patrick Kirinus; London-Heathrow Airport (LHR/EGLL); 17 June 2007 photo (c) Udo Kirinus; London-Heathrow Airport (LHR/EGLL); 05 May 2002 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The plane was carrying 36 attendees, returning from the 50th Annual Aviation Safety Conference held in Warsaw.  Nine attendees deplaned at Powidz and eleven at PoznÃ¡n-Krzesiny AB. It took off from Krzesiny at 18:24. Weather at Miroslawiec was poor with a ceiling at 300 feet and a visibility 2 sm in mist. The crew were cleared for a PAR approach to runway 12/30. The approach was unstabilized.  On finals, the left bank reached 76 deg and pitch reached -21 degrees. The aircraft hit the ground 1300 m from runway 30 threshold and 320 meters left of extended runway centerline. The aircraft impacted terrain in left sideslip, on heading 220 deg (runway heading was 304 deg), disintegrated and partially burnt. Rate of descent at the moment of ground impact reached approx 6000 feet/min and the ground speed was 148 knots. The aircraft's landing gear was extended and flaps were at 15 degrees setting, at impact. PRIMARY CAUSE: Inadvertent loss of spatial and situational awareness by the aircraft crew during final stages of PAR approach, which, within 12 seconds period before crash, resulted in the aircraftÂs bank increasing unmonitored and accompanying altitude loss, while the flight crew apparently was trying to establish visual contact with runway and approach lights. Among the secondary causes the Board listed: * Improper flight crew selection for the flight:   - The PIC did not have any previous experience on this version of CASA C-295 aircraft, which was additionally equipped with 2 IRS/GPS LN-100G units instead of 2 TOPSTAR 100-2 GPS receivers, and, ironically, with EGPWS Mk. V - unfortunately lack of cryptographic modules in GPS receivers, which made IRS/GPS LN-100G system almost useless (IRS alone with no GPS enhancement) caused flight crew to use handheld GPS receivers (Garmin GPSMAP 196),   - The SIC was not rated in CASA C-295 aircraft for night/IMC operations, * Poor flight crew coordination and cooperation (poor MCC & CRM): 	- improper altimeter setting procedures, 	- probably both pilots were looking for visual cues and nobody was observing flight instruments in the very last seconds before they crash), * Poor weather conditions in vicinity of Miroslawiec AB; ceiling 300 feet, visibility 2 sm, in mist. Icing was excluded as a factor. * Spatial disorientation of the flight crew, * EGPWS Audio warning was inhibited (the flight crew missed EGPWS test before departure from Warsaw, even though it was a checklist item, and never corrected the problem - the PIC was not familiar with the system - he has never flown before CASA C-295M equipped with EGPWS) - in result no audio warning of excessive bank angle, high terrain closure rate and high sink rate was available to the flight crew, as well as no automatic height above ground callouts were given, * The flight crew failed to monitor radio-altimeter indication during both approaches, * Both pilots concentrated their attention outside of the cockpit during final seconds before crash and did not scan flight instruments. * The military PAR controller did a poor job during the approach, he let for the non-stabilized approach, he was not compensating properly for left crosswind of 20 kts and allowed the aircraft to stay high above glide slope during both PAR approaches, he also was not fully aware of altimeter setting (QNH or QFE) and altitude reports by flight crewÂ improper values QNH/QFE were used by the flight crew during first approach, additionally PIC has set his altimeter to QFE, while SIC to QNH. During the approach the controllerÂs instructions were hesitant and inconsistent, probably making the flight crew to believe their approach was going well. * The military PAR controller was giving improper suggestions to the flight crew - he was questioning them during final stage of approach whether they see approach or runway lights or not, instead of continuous talking them down to the runway threshold, * Altimeter indications were improperly interpreted by the flight crew, * Improperly performed search for visual contact by the flight crew during final stage of approach, * Improper, lacking weather situation analysis performed by the PIC before the flight, * The flight crew did not properly set DH/MDA (they did the same error on previous two legs before crash). Contributing factors were: * The SIC was not rated in CASA C-295 aircraft for night/IMC operations (the SIC total flight time was 800 hours including 100 hours in CASA C-295M), * The PIC has no previous experience on the accident version of CASA C-295 aircraft, (although he logged 800+ hours in another version of CASA C-295M aircraft used by Polish AF and his total flight time was 2500 hours), * Because of lack of GPS enhancement to IRS, the flight crew used Garmin GPSMAP 196 handheld GPS receiver, * The PIC had no previous experience in PAR approaches in IMC, close to minimums, which in Miroslawiec AB were reported to be aprox. ceiling 270 feet and visibility of 3300 feet, * The milSources: BBC  Polish Air Force   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The Merauke air traffic controller reported that when the aircraft was on final approach there were no obstructions on the runway, so he cleared the aircraft to land on runway 16.  During the landing roll, the pilot observed that a cow had entered the active runway and was running across the runway in front of the aircraft. When the aircraft was about 1,000 meters from the runway 16 threshold, the left engine struck the cow. The pilots stopped the aircraft on the runway and shut down the left engine. The cabin crew informed the pilots that left engine cowling was damaged.  The aircraft's occupants were not injured, and disembarked from the aircraft unaided, using air stairs at the apron. The investigation found that the airport did not meet the requirements of ICAO Annex 14, Volume 1, Paragraph 9.10.2, Standard, or the intent of Civil Aviation Safety Regulation (CASR) 139 Subparts 4.2 and 4.12.

However, the airline that used the hangar needed to house a plane. Since they had priority, the Citation was taken out of the hangar about 16:30 and moved back to the ramp area. While the airplane was on the ramp, the weather condition had turned from light snow to freezing rain. The pilot and her passenger arrived at the airport about 17:15. About 1730, the airplane's engines were started and the airplane was observed taxing. The FBO representative heard the pilot's announcements over the radio in the FBO. He also noticed the airplane was not on the taxiway, but on the grass area on the south side of the asphalt taxiway. At that time the ground was covered with snow and ice. The FBO representative noted the pilot did not activate the airport's taxi and runways lights via the common airport frequency radio channel. It was observed that the airplane taxied through a ditch, which was covered with ice and snow. The airplane's engines were heard at a high rate of power about this time. It was later discovered that the airplane's left main tire broke through the ice and became stuck in the ditch. The airplane continued on the grass area after the high engine power was heard. The FBO representative heard the pilot announce the wrong runway (runway 35) that she was planning to depart from. The FBO representative turned on the runway and taxi lights after hearing the incorrect runway announcement. The pilot later announced a change of departure from runway 35 to runway 17, while the airplane was observed back taxing on runway 26 onto taxiway ""C"". About 17:45 the airplane took off from runway 17. After takeoff, the pilot contacted the Air Traffic Controller (ATC) and reported that she was at 1,000 feet, climbing to 10,000 feet. About one minute later, the pilot declared an emergency and stated, ""We've got an attitude indicator failure"". About seven seconds later, the pilot announced over the frequency they were not certain which way they were turning. Radar contact was lost shortly after that. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The pilot's spatial disorientation and subsequent failure to maintain airplane control.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: MIA08MA051 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  Two Dead In West Gardiner Plane Crash (WCSH6, 2-2-2008)   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; 9,5 km SSW of Augusta State Airport, ME (AUG); February 2008; (publicdomain) photo (c) FAA; 9,5 km SSW of Augusta State Airport, ME (AUG); February 2008 photo (c) NTSB; 9,5 km SSW of Augusta State Airport, ME (AUG); February 2008; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot reported to the control tower at Nassau that he was having problems with the landing gear and wished to continue flying while attempting to troubleshoot and apply emergency gear extension procedures. The aircraft departed the traffic area after permission was granted. According to the pilots, the aircraft continued to the west of Nassau where the emergency procedures were performed. Despite following the emergency gear extension procedures, the crew could not get the gear to extend. The crew then decided to return to Nassau. The crew landed using the emergency gear extension checklist that addressed landing with one gear not extended. The pilot reported that âdespite following the checklist,â the aircraft was not able to maintain directional control upon touchdown and this resulted in a runway excursion. The aircraft touchdown point was approximately 6,500ft from the threshold of Runway 09. Several runway lights, runway marking sign and the Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) were damaged by the aircraft on landing roll-out. The aircraft came to rest slightly to the right of Intersection Kilo (K) approximately 200 feet to the right of Runway 09.  There were no reported injuries to passengers or crew at the scene.  Probable Cause Probable cause has been determined as detachment of the right main landing gear door aft hinge attachment. (The locking wire which secures the gear door attachment bolt in place was found broken which allowed the attachment bolt to disengage. Once the bolt disengaged the aft door hinge detached from its secure position resulting in the movement of the hinge. This may have resulted in the hinge jamming the gear door resulting in the right main landing gear failure). Contributing Factors Pilot action/error has been largely attributed to the cause of this accident in that; 1. The right landing gear door position light illuminated on the Annunciator Panel. The pilot in command went outside and closed the door. Based on his admissions he did not report this defect to maintenance nor did he complete the appropriate technical log entry. (Had the pilot following the appropriate procedures for reporting mechanical irregularities this accident may have been avoided). 2. The pilot in command was in a hurry to get home. When the accident investigators arrived at the scene the PIC had already left for his next job. (Get-home-itis) (This was evidenced as the PIC by telephone called later to say he could not stay at the scene as he had to get to his other job.)Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: DCABah Report number:  Status: Preliminary reportDuration: 1 monthDownload report:  Preliminary report Sources: DCA  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates30-May-2023 20:29 harro Added 30-May-2023 20:34 harro Updated Corrections or additions? ...

The cabin of the aircraft was configured for cargo operations with no passenger seats fitted, as the only other planned occupant was the operatorÂs Chief Engineer, who would be sitting beside the commander in the right hand seat. However, the commander asked the operator if he could take a family member with him to SXM. The operator agreed and an extra seat was fitted. Witnesses stated that the commander appeared ""rushed"" prior to departure. The commander stated that he partially carried out the normal pre-flight inspection. He then started the engines. Before taxiing he realised that the nose landing gear chocks were still in place so he shut down the left hand engine, removed and stowed the chocks and then restarted the left engine. The aircraft took off from runway 10 at 14:15 hrs. At between 100 ft and 150 ft the commander initiated a left turn but after some initial movement the ailerons jammed. When he discovered that he was unable to straighten the ailerons he attempted to return to land on runway 10. The other flight controls did not appear to be restricted. With the ailerons jammed, the aircraft continued to turn to the left, losing altitude as it flew over a settlement to the north of the aerodrome, until pointed directly at the Air Traffic Control tower, causing the Air Traffic Control Officer (ATCO) to abandon the tower. The commander judged that the aircraft was too fast and high to attempt a landing and therefore initiated a go-around, applying full power. He continued the left turn, losing height and speed to position the aircraft for another approach but, as the aircraft descended over the northern edge of the runway, its left wing struck the perimeter fence. On impact the aircraft spun about its vertical axis with its wings level and continued sliding sideways on its right side for approximately 80 ft before coming to rest facing north-west. CONCLUSIONS: ""The commander was probably distracted from his normal duties whilst arranging additional seating to accommodate the second passenger. He did not complete the requisite pre-flight check or the subsequent check of full and free movement of the flight controls, either of which would have revealed an obstruction to proper operation of the ailerons.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: AAIB Bulletin 2/2009 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Vancouver International Airport, BC (YVR/CYVR); August 1993 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The weather conditions at Edinburgh Airport were wintry with snowfall, which required the aircraft to be de-iced. Shortly after both engines had been started, the commander signalled to the marshaller to remove the Ground Power Unit (GPU) from the aircraft, which was facing nose out from its stand, down a slight slope. As the marshaller went to assist his colleague to remove the GPU to a safe distance prior to the aircraft taxiing off the stand, the aircraft started to move forward slowly, forcing them to run to safety. The flight crew, who were looking into the cockpit, were unaware that the aircraft was moving. It continued to move forward until its right propeller struck the GPU, causing substantial damage to the GPU, the propeller and the engine. The ground crew were uninjured. CONCLUSION: ""The aircraft moved forward inadvertently after engine start, causing its right propeller to strike a GPU. Possible explanations include that the parking brake was not set, the chocks had slipped from the nosewheel, or the chocks were removed prematurely. There was insufficient evidence to determine which of these scenarios was the most likely. Contributory factors were: the aircraft was facing down a slight downslope, the ramp was slippery due to the weather conditions and the flight crew increased engine speed to top up the pneumatic system pressure. The airport operatorÂs instructions contained in MDD 04/07 required aircraft facing nose-out on North Cargo Apron stands to be towed onto the taxiway centreline, prior to starting engines. Had these instructions been complied with, the accident would probably have been avoided.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: AAIB Bulletin 2/2009 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  1 July 2000 G-JEAP Channel Express 0 Coventry-Baginton Airport (CVT) sub 7 May 2004 G-CEXG Channel Express 0 Bournemouth International Airport (BOH/EGHH) min Location  Images: photo (c) AAIB; Edinburgh-Turnhouse Airport (EDI); February 2008 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Around 10:59, a ground handler, stopped in a vehicle near parking area S31 to let the Boeing 777 pass, saw the fairing of the right main landing gear's nose wheel detach. The fairing fell off and rolled to the left of taxiway A. Sparks and smoke appeared from the right nose wheel of the right main landing gear. The ground handler, whose vehicle was not equipped with a radio, followed the aircraft and asked another agent to inform air traffic control services. At 11:02:59, while the aircraft was on taxiway B, the ground controller informed the crew that they had been informed about a metal part left at their parking area. The controller also instructed the crew to turn left and stop. The crew did not understand the meaning of the Ground controller's message. At 11:03:38, the SOL controller asked the crew to continue taxiing to holding point 27L and informed them that he would call them back to stop. The crew was uncertain whether they should continue taxiing to the 27L runway holding point or stop. At 11:04:11, as the aircraft turned left onto taxiway Y11 leading to the Y11 holding point of runway 27L, the SOL controller instructed the crew not to proceed to the holding point but to take the first taxiway. The PF then decided to turn onto taxiway Q. At 11:04:48, the co-pilot contacted the ground handling staff to try to gather more information. At 11:05:31, the crew of a Continental Air Lines B757, following the B777 during taxi, informed the Ground controller that a tire on one of the Boeing 777's wheels had caught fire and requested assistance from the fire brigade. They also informed the B777 crew on the Ground frequency. At 11:06:12, the captain of the Boeing 777 ordered the evacuation. The aircraft was then located on taxiway Q at Y12. The 125 passengers and crew members evacuated through the slide rafts of the eight aircraft doors. Two cabin crew members were injured during the evacuation through door 2L. The intervention of the firefighters successfully extinguished the fire. An examination of the wheel and its components was conducted by Boeing. It showed that two identical bearings had been installed in the internal and external positions on the right main landing gear's nose wheel. The wheel spindle of the Boeing 777 is conical, and the internal and external bearings are not interchangeable. The bearing installed in the external position was identified as an internal wheel bearing. It was not possible to identify how an internal bearing could have been installed in place of an external bearing.Sources: https://bea.aero/en/investigation-reports/notified-events/detail/feu-au-niveau-du-train-principal-droit-au-cours-du-roulage-vers-la-piste-evacuation-durgence/ History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  20 February 2021 N772UA United Airlines 0 near Denver International Airport (DEN/KDEN), Denver, CO min Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates02-Jun-2023 17:53 harro Added Corrections or additions? ...

The copilot was the handling pilot for the descent, approach and landing at Darwin and the pilot in command was the monitoring pilot. The crew had received a weather briefing prior to the departure from Cairns, informing them that there were showers and thunderstorms in the Darwin area for their arrival. Air traffic control (ATC) cleared the crew to conduct the Darwin runway 29 ILS approach. The monitoring pilot stated that the runway was in sight prior to flying over the Howard Springs non-directional beacon (NDB). Information from the aircraftÂs flight data recorder (FDR) indicated that the aircraft flew over the Howard Springs NDB at about 3,000 ft above mean sea level (AMSL), with a computed air speed of 221 knots. The aircraft was configured for landing at the outer marker, where the handling pilot disconnected the autopilot and the approach was flown manually by reference to the ILS and visual reference with the runway lighting. During the approach and landing, the aircraft autothrottle remained engaged. At approximately 700 ft AMSL, the aircraft entered a rain shower. The monitoring pilot switched on the windscreen wipers and, as both pilots stated that they could see the runway lighting and PAPI, the approach was continued. At approximately 30 ft radio altitude, the FDR recorded a rate of descent of approximately 1,000 ft/min at the same time as an abrupt control column nose up command was applied. The copilot recalled hearing the synthesised calls of radio altitude from the aircraftÂs radar altimeter. At 21:14:50, the aircraft touched down with a rate of descent of about 1,000 ft/min, which resulted in a hard impact with the runway prior to the 300 m runway markings. The aircraft then bounced before settling onto the runway. The crew completed the landing rollout and taxied the aircraft to the terminal. CONTRIBUTING SAFETY FACTORS: - The aircraft was above the glideslope at the Howard Springs non-directional beacon and throughout the majority of the approach, resulting in high rates of descent on several occasions as attempts were made to capture the glideslope. - The copilot disconnected the autopilot at a time of high workload. - The aircraft's rate of descent below 400 ft above aerodrome level exceeded the operatorÂs stabilised approach criteria; however, because the pilot in command considered the exceedance to be momentary, a missed approach was not conducted. - The allowance of momentary excursions in the aircraft operatorÂs stabilised approach criteria that were caused by wind gusts or turbulence increased risk by permitting flight crew discretion to continue approaches at or beyond those criteria. [Minor safety issue] - The operatorÂs procedure for the use of the autothrottle in response to high rates of descent when below 30 ft during landing was not included in the operatorÂs standard operating procedures. [Minor safety issue] - At about 30 ft, the copilot made an abrupt rearward movement of the control column resulting in the main landing gear moving faster downwards than the aircraftÂs overall rate of descent. OTHER SAFETY FACTORS: - The operatorÂs process for reporting 717 pilot training issues to senior managers was not utilised by all flight crew, reducing the potential for the communication of fleet-wide issues to all 717 crews. [Minor safety issue] - There was no clear division of responsibilities between the aircraft operator and the third party training provider in regard to ensuring the standards of flight training met all of the operatorÂs requirements, which had the potential to reduce training effectiveness. [Minor safety issue] - There was no provision in the current Civil Aviation Safety Authority regulations or orders regarding third party flight crew training providers, with the effect that the responsibility for training outcomes was unclear. [Minor safety issue] - There was no aircraft operatorÂs or manufacturerÂs 717 pilot training manual that provided for the standardisation of instructional technique and provided a reference document for pilots during and following training. [Minor safety issue] - The control column moved forward after touchdown, resulting in excessive weight transfer to the nosewheel before the right mainwheel was correctly loaded. - After touchdown, the thrust levers were advanced, inadvertently cancelling the deployment of the ground spoilers and resulting in unstable conditions while transitioning from flight to the ground. - The aircraft operator's Route Manual did not include all relevant information on the potential for visual illusions during a night approach to runway 29 at Darwin Airport that would have improved the awareness of flight crews. [Minor safety issue] - The Jeppesen-Sanderson Inc. approach chart titled Darwin, NT Australia ILS-Z or LOC-Z Rwy 29 dated 21 SEP 07 incorrectly depicted a level flight segment after the Howard Springs non-directional beacon that could have been misinterpreted by flight crews. [Minor safety issue] - The lack of runway centreline lighting reduced the available visual cues during the latter stages of the approach and landing to runway 29 at Darwin Airport.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ATSB Report number: AO-2008-007 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Qantas safety record under threat (News.com.au 12-2-2008)  ATSB Occurrence 200800641 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  2 May 2011 VH-NXE Qantas 0 Perth Airport, WA (PER/YPPH) min Location  Images: photo (c) Bill Mallinson; Perth Airport, WA (PER/YPPH); 17 October 2015 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Destination was Santiago de Los Caballeros, with nine tourists on board. On the return flight, at approximately 70 miles northwest of the Punta Cana Airport, the captain decided to fly to the La Romana Airport (the alternate airport), to refuel because he did not perform this operation at the Cibao Airport and because the fuel quantity indicator in the left tank was inoperative. He had doubts about the remaining fuel in the tanks. On the way to the alternate airport, the no.1 engine failed. The captain attempt to restart the engine but this failed. Engine no. 2 was still running. The pilot, aware that the fault that turned off engine no.1 was the lack of fuel, made the decision to land in a sugarcane field near El Prado, located in the province of El Seybo, for fear that the remaining engine would also go out, perhaps without a suitable place to land later. Given these conditions, the captain chose a segment of a lane in the middle of two cane fields, where he made the emergency landing. The surface of this trail was not totally flat. After having a landing run of about 100 feet, the nose wheel collided with a stone, breaking the nose landing gear. Directional control was lost and the aircraft turned to the left, entering a cane field. Cause: - The accident occurred due to the fact that engine # 1 was turned off due to lack of fuel and when making the emergency landing the captain could not keep the aircraft in the correct path of the selected lane for said landing.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIAA Dom.

About 0930, the captain transmitted to air traffic control (ATC) that the flight was climbing through 11,700 feet to its cruise altitude of flight level (FL) 210 (approximately 21,000 feet mean sea level.) The controller acknowledged the transmission and cleared the flight to proceed to an intersection along the flight route located about 29 miles north-northwest of the destination airport, and the flight crew acknowledged. At 0933, during cruise flight, the controller repeated the navigational clearance, which the flight crew acknowledged, and the airplane turned in accordance with the clearance. At 0940, the controller instructed the flight to change radio frequencies, and there was no response. The controller continued to try to contact the flight crew multiple times but received no reply. At 0951, the airplane crossed the intersection that was its clearance limit then turned southeast toward the destination airport without descending, which is consistent with the airplane being on autopilot. The controller handling the flight asked another controller to attempt to contact the flight crew on a different frequency, but there was still no response, and the flight proceeded on a southeasterly heading at FL 210. About 0955, the flight crossed over the destination airport and continued on a southeasterly course without changing altitude or heading. Two separate airline crews in the area attempted to contact the incident crew, but neither flight crewsâ attempts were successful.  About 0958, when the flight was about 26 nautical miles southeast of the destination airport, the captain contacted the controller with an abbreviated call sign (âAh HCF ten zero twoâ), and the controller asked if the flight crew was experiencing an emergency. The captain responded, ""No, we must have missed a hand off or missed a call or something."" The controller then issued instructions for the flight to return to the destination airport, with which the flight crew complied. The flight arrived without further incident about 1015.  The captain and first officer both reported to their company that they had unintentionally fallen asleep in flight. The fact that both pilots fell asleep during the midmorning hours, a time of day normally associated with wakefulness and rising alertness, indicates that both pilots were fatigued.  The captain had undiagnosed severe obstructive sleep apnea, which was diagnosed during a medical evaluation shortly after this incident and for which symptoms (such as snoring) and risk factors (such as obesity) were present before the incident. This condition likely caused him to experience chronic daytime fatigue and contributed to his falling asleep during the incident flight.  Probable Cause: The captain and first officer inadvertently falling asleep during the cruise phase of flight. Contributing to the incident were the captain's undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea and the flight crewâs recent work schedules, which included several consecutive days of early-morning start times.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: SEA08IA080 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates23-Oct-2016 16:13 harro Added 03-Nov-2018 20:40 ASN Update Bot Updated [Time, Operator, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, Accident report, ]03-Nov-2018 20:42 harro Updated [Location, Narrative, ]09-Jun-2023 14:36 Ron Averes Updated Corrections or additions? ...

All three crew members and eighteen passengers survived the accident. The airplane arrived as flight BRU1833 from Minsk-2 International Airport (MSQ), Belarus at 02:05. Refueling was carried out in preparation for the return flight and the crew conducted the flight planning. After refueling the pilot carried out a tactile and visual inspection of all critical surfaces of the wing and visual inspection of the tail assembly. All the planes were clean and dry. The weather reported for the 04:00 was: wind 110 degrees at the ground 1 m/sec, visibility 3500 meters, haze, small clouds, vertical visibility of 800 meters, scattered clouds at 3000 m, a temperature of minus 3Â° C, dew point minus 4Â° C, pressure 1019 hPa.  At 04:08 both engines were started. The engine air intake heating (cowl anti-ice) was switched on but the wing anti-icing system was not switched on. The crew taxied to runway 27 and were cleared for departure. During takeoff the airplane progressively banked left until the left wing tip contacted runway. The airplane went off the side with the airplane rolling the right. The right hand wing broke off and spilled fuel caught fire. The airplane came to rest upside down. CONCLUSION (translated from Russian): The accident involving aircraft CRJ-100LR registration number EW-101PJ was the result of an asymmetric loss of lift of the wing during take-off, which led to the toppling of the aircraft immediately after liftoff from the runway, the left wing tip contacting the ground, the subsequent destruction and fire. The reason for the loss of lift of the wing at the actual weather conditions, was the formation of frost, which ""pollutes"" the surface of the wing. The cause of formation of frost, most likely, was the fuel icing, while the aircraft was parked at the airport and during taxiing for the return flight, resulting in a difference in temperature of the surrounding air and cold fuel in the tanks after the flight. The situation could be aggravated when exceeding the values recommended by the operations manual of the angular velocity when lifting the nose wheel during takeoff with ""contaminated"" wings when it is impossible to monitor this parameter instrumentally. Existing procedural methods of control of the aerodynamic surfaces of the aircraft before departure, along with the inefficiency, during takeoff, the existing system of protection from stalling due to increased sensitivity of the wing, even to a slight contamination of the leading edge, can not fully guarantee the prevention of similar accidents in future. An Airworthiness Directive on the need to include anti-icing systems on the wing in the final stage of taxiing at the actual weather conditions was issued by Transport Canada after the accident. This probably could have prevented the accident.Sources: MAK Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC)  Reuters  Belavia press release   Location  Images: photo (c) Interstate Aviation Committee; Yerevan-Zvartnots Airport (EVN); February 2008 photo (c) Interstate Aviation Committee; Yerevan-Zvartnots Airport (EVN); February 2008 photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG/LFPG); January 2008 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

According to the Flight Attendant, she got out of her jumpseat after 10,000 feet to begin service. As she proceeded to the galley, she slipped and fell. The flight attendant said there was glycol on the floor, and she must have slipped on it. She had difficulty getting up. A passenger seated in 2A was able to assist her into seat 1A. Another passenger came forward and identified himself as a family physician and offered assistance. He had her apply ice to her ankle and got the interphone for her so she could notify the Captain. The flight attendant informed the Captain that she could not continue to work the flight. The captain made the decision to turn around and go back to CVG instead of continuing onto GSP. The captain made an announcement advising the passengers that she was injured and unable to continue and they would be returning to CVG.  After landing, the Emergency Medical Service met the aircraft and carried her off the airplane. The passengers then deplaned back into the terminal. At the hospital, the flight attendant said the doctor informed her that her leg was broken in three places.

The copilot gave his place on board to a passenger without any qualification to operate the aircraft, moments after takeoff. During the en-route flight phase, the secondary pitch trim system was activated, which would have resulted in an abnormal operation of the system, followed by violent loss of altitude and over speed condition. Possible Causes: Absence of Crew Coordination and disregard of the Co-pilot's command post responsibilities. * The flight was performed, at least during the last 32 minutes, by the pilot in command with the aircraft passenger in the co-pilot's seat. In this condition, it does not comply with RAV 60.2(a) and 60.10 (b), (e) and (d). In these circumstances, it was not possible to effectively perform emergency procedures for this condition, since the passenger was not capable of performing them. - Conscious modification of flight conditions. - The aircraft was in cruise, straight and level flight. The condition was altered by the actuation of the Secondary Trim Switch, which was not required for this flight condition, since this is an Emergency Trim System, in case the Primary System, presents a failure. - Abnormal operation of the Horizontal Stabilizer Pitch Trim System. - When the Horizontal Stabilizer Pitch Trim Secondary System double switch was actuated, it triggered an abnormal operation of the aircraft's horizontal stabilizer trim system with runaway characteristics (Trim Runaway) and almost immediately caused an over-speed condition. This failure, which could have been of an electrical or mechanical nature, could not be solved according to the emergency procedures that could have been executed, as described in the AFM section 111, which inhibited the recovery of the aircraft and caused the impact against the ground with high speed and thrust.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JIAAC Venezuela Report number: 010/2008 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: NotiSAR  Report A-149/CENIPA/2015   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All 46 on board were killed. MÃ©rida Airport is located in a mountain valley at an elevation of 5010 feet. Terrain in the valley rises from 1000 to 19.500 feet. Arrivals and departures have to use the Rio Chama corridor to the west of the airport. Runway 07 is used for landings and takeoffs have to be performed in the opposite direction, from runway 25.  Santa BÃ¡rbara Airlines however used an unpublished approach and departure procedure which let the aircraft use a valley to the northeast of the airport. This procedure saved about 15 minutes of flying time on the route to Caracas. After all passengers had boarded for flight 518 to Caracas, it took about 30 minutes for the pilots to arrive at the aircraft. Being late, they immediately started the engines while simultaneously asking for permission to do so. Because an Avior Airlines flight was approaching the airport, the crew were told to expedite their departure or wait for the arrival of the Avior aircraft. The flight crew decided to go and began taxiing 2 minutes and 40 seconds after startup. Consequently the AHRS (attitude and heading reference) system of the airplane was unusable. The aircraft needed to remain still for 3 minutes after the battery is turned on so that all gyroscopes, accelerometers and magnetometers can be stabilized and synchronized. The AHRS provides attitude information for aircraft, including roll, pitch and yaw. The captain possibly expected to re-initialize the system while they were at cruising altitude. After departure from runway 25 the crew planned to use the unpublished procedure. Climbing through clouds a 180-degree turn was initiated. Using the unreliable magnetic compass, the flight made a 270 degree turn, heading towards rising terrain. The captain took over control from the copilot. When visual contact with terrain was regained, the crew noted they were heading for mountains. The captain tried to avoid rising terrain but the aircraft impacted the side of a mountain at 3810 m. CONCLUSIONS The attitude and heading reference system (AHRS) as a device was operational, however the initialization of the system was incomplete, so the standard mode was in a fault condition. This failure mode left the RMI or radio magnetic indicators and the autopilot inoperative.  The EGPWS or enhanced ground proximity warning system was inoperative in the ""enhanced"" functions, since the information is displayed on the EFIS system screens, therefore there was no early warning (Visual) of impact against the mountain range. The GPS was the only instrument capable of providing heading information to within one degree of accuracy. Because it is located on the co-pilot's lower left panel, the information provided by the co-pilot was basically available for co-pilot observation. In addition, the size of the display is relatively small for the information it shows. The crew was valid, qualified and certified by the National Institute of Civil Aeronautics (INAC). However, the crew was very unconcerned to learn that they were taking off with the AHRS system inoperative and the weather conditions were instrument or IMC. The meteorological station in Merida was inoperative. The control tower did not have an operational communications recording system.

The airplane was registered to the Southwest Orthopedic and Sports Medicine Clinic and operated by Interstate Helicopters. At the time of the accident, Interstate Helicopters was operating the accident airplane in commercial service contrary to its Federal Aviation Administration-issued 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135 operating certificate, which, at the time, did not authorize operation of the accident airplane or any other fixed-wing aircraft. The Cessna Citation took off from Wiley Post Airport, OK at 15:13 and climbed to an altitude of 3,100 feet while on a southwesterly heading. While in the airspace near the Lake Overholser dam the airplane started a steep descent. The airplane impacted wooded terrain approximately one mile south of the dam. There were no reported radio calls of distress from the flight crew. Investigation revealed that departure from controlled flight likely resulted from wing structure damage sustained during an in-flight collision with a flock of American white pelicans, which far exceeded the airframeÂs design certification limit. Also, the right engine failed as a result of the collision with these birds.

There were seven people on board; two pilots, two engineers, and three flight officers. The pilots reported that the approach and landing were normal. However, both Beta lights did not illuminate during the landing roll, so they could not use reverse thrust. The crew used maximum brakes to slow the aircraft, and rolled through to the end of runway 15. During the 180-degree right turn at the end of the runway, they felt the left brakes grabbing, and had to use increased thrust on the left engine to assist the turn. After completing the turn, the pilots backtracked the aircraft towards taxiway E, about 450 meters from the departure end of runway 15. The air traffic controller informed the Transall crew that heavy smoke was coming from the left main wheels, and that they should proceed to taxiway E and stop on the taxiway. Before the aircraft entered taxiway E, the controller activated the crash alarm. The pilots stopped the aircraft on taxiway E, and the occupants disembarked and attempted to extinguish the wheel-bay fire with a hand held extinguisher. The airport rescue fire fighting service (RFFS) arrived at the aircraft 10 minutes after the aircraft came to a stop on taxiway E. It took a further 5 minutes to commence applying foam. The attempts to extinguish the fire were unsuccessful, and the fire destroyed the aircraft and its cargo of fuel in drums. CAUSES: ""The aircraft's left main wheels' brakes overheated during the landing roll and a fire commenced in the brake assembly of one or more of the left main landing gear wheels.  The evidence indicated that a brake cylinder and/or hydraulic line may have failed. It is likely that brake system hydraulic fluid under pressure, was the propellant that fed the fire.  There was no Emergency Response Plan at Wamena.

The fuel was concealed in drink cans and mixed with fragrance to hide the smell.Sources: China foils attack on passenger plane (Xinhua 9-3-2008)  https://zh.wikipedia.org/  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

This circuit breaker was missed when the airplane was restored to normal operating condition. On March 8, 2008, the first officer was performing the co-pilot duties. Clearance was received and the pilot in command began taxiing. The first officer started to program the flight management system. There was a strong gusty wind from the left. They had to make a 90-degee right turn to join the taxiway. The pilot in command made some comment about the brakes. The first officer looked up and they were headed toward an unoccupied parked airplane on the opposite side of the taxiway. At that time they struck the parked airplane. According to both crew members with the direction of the wind, nose steering alone was not enough to turn the airplane onto the taxiway. Brakes were needed but there were no brakes, and emergency brakes were not used. Probable Cause: The flight crew's failure to reset the brakes circuit breaker resulting in a loss of brakes during taxi and an on ground collision with an unoccupied parked airplane.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: MIA08CA074 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: NTSB MIA08CA074  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates03-Oct-2022 07:47 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

The airplane operated on AdamAir flight KI292 from Jakarta.  Prior to descent, the flight crew received weather information indicating that the weather at their destination, Batam Airport, was fine. At 03:02 UTC the flight crew contacted the Batam Tower controller and were informed that the visibility was 1,000 meters and they were sequence number three for landing runway 04. The controller subsequently informed flight 292 that a preceding aircraft had the runway in sight at an altitude of about 500 feet and reported that the wind was 360 degrees at 8 knots with heavy rain.  The flight crew configured the aircraft for landing, using flaps 40 degrees. The flight crew were able to see the runway prior to the Decision Altitude (DA), however the PIC was convinced that continuing the approach to landing was unsafe and elected to go around. At 03:19 UTC, flight 292 was again established on the localizer runway 04, and the Tower controller informed them that the visibility had improved to 2,000 meters. While on final approach, the flight crew reported that the runway was in sight and they received landing clearance. During the landing roll, as the groundspeed decreased below 30 knots, the aircraft yawed to the right. The flight crew attempted to steer the aircraft back to centerline by applying full left rudder. The aircraft continued yaw to the right and came to stop on the runway shoulder at approximately 40 meters from the right side of the runway edge, and 2,760 meters from the runway 04 threshold. No one was injured in this accident. The aircraft was seriously damaged with the right main landing gear assembly detached and collapsing backward and damaging the right wing and flaps. The right engine was displaced from its attachment point.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSC Report number: KNKT.08.03.05.04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: Adam Air 737 skids off runway at Batam (Flightglobal 10-3-2008)  Ministry of Transport statement   Location  Images: photo (c) RenÃ© Verschuur; Jakarta-Soekarno-Hatta International Airport (CGK/WIII); 13 August 2007 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates15-Mar-2024 19:52 ASN Updated [Accident report, ]15-Mar-2024 19:52 ASN Updated The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

It was expected to arrive at Bebi Airstrip at approximately 09:21. The aircraft contacted Enugu ATC at 08:56 while descending to FL110. The crew were cleared to descend further down to 5000 feet. It did not arrive at Bebi Airstrip and was declared missing.  On August 30, 2008, hunters found the wreckage in thick rain forest in Obanliku local government area. Investigation revealed that the Enugu tower controller issued descent instructions to 5, 000 feet AMSL (FL50) outside its control airspace not considering that the aircraft was not flying the filed flight plan route and the minimum safe altitude (MSA) of the area reported by Jeppesen charts as 11,200 feet. Causal Factor: I. The flight crew conducted an approach into a VFR airfield in an instrument meteorological condition and did not maintain terrain clearance and minimum safe altitude which led to Controlled Flight Into Terrain. II. The crew did not respond promptly to GPWS warning. Contributory Factors 1. The flight crew was not familiar with the route in a situation of low clouds, poor visibility and mountainous terrain. 2. The Area Controllers did not detect the estimate as passed by the pilot for positions not in the filed flight plan (LIPAR and LUNDO) and omitting ENUGU. 3. The erroneous co-location of Bebi airstrip and Obudu on the NAMA Chart confused the crew.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIB Nigeria Report number: WINGS/2008/03/15/F Status: Investigation completedDuration: 7 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   Obudu-bound plane missing (Daily Trust, 16-3-2008)  Search for missing airplane moves to Cameroon, 4 days after (Daily Sun, 19-3-2008)  How 'missing' plane was flown out of Nigeria - The Obasanjo connection (Nigerian Tribune, 28-4-2008)   Location  Images: photo (c) Accident Investigation Bureau Nigeria; near Bushi Village, Obanliku; September 2008 photo (c) Accident Investigation Bureau Nigeria; near Bushi Village, Obanliku; September 2008 photo (c) Accident Investigation Bureau Nigeria; near Bushi Village, Obanliku; September 2008 photo (c) Accident Investigation Bureau Nigeria; near Bushi Village, Obanliku; September 2008 photo (c) Accident Investigation Bureau Nigeria; near Bushi Village, Obanliku; September 2008 photo (c) Accident Investigation Bureau Nigeria; near Bushi Village, Obanliku; September 2008 photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Puerto Plata-Gregorio LuperÃ³n International Airport (POP/MDPP); January 2000 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were no injuries among the 24 passengers and three crew members. Cirrus Airlines Flight 1567 departed Berlin-Tempelhof Airport (THF) at 16:30 on a domestic service to Mannheim Airport (MHG). The copilot was Pilot Flying (PF). During the flight the copilot commented that he had difficulties in landing at Mannheim. The captain replied that he did fine. At 17:36 the flight was cleared for a LOC/DME approach to runway 27. One minute later the flight reached the prescribed altitude of 5000 feet. The descent was continued until the PF noticed his error. The captain instructed the PF to arrest the descent and climb back towards 5000 feet. By then the flight had descended to 3800 feet, 100 feet below the Minimum Sector Altitude (MSA). After reaching the Final Approach Fix at 5000 feet, the crew reported that they were established on the localizer. Langen Radar instructed the flight to contact Mannheim Tower.  The airplane was configured for the final approach and landing, with the captain telling the PF not to worry several times. The PF attempted to flare the airplane for landing, but the aircraft floated over the runway without touching down. The PF then stated: ""Oh - your control"". The captain took over control and replied ""My control"". At that moment the airplane was 200 m past the runway threshold. Touchdown was accomplished at 530 m, with 480 m of runway remaining. The airplane failed to decelerate as expected and the captain called for manual braking action. The airplane overran the runway end at a speed of 50 knots. The left hand main gear collapsed as it hit a pothole. The aircraft then slid into an earthen wall and came to rest. There was no fire. Overran runway on landing and hit an earthen wall. One wing and engine severely damaged. CAUSES: The accident happened because: - The aircraft overran the end of the runway and collided with an embankment, - No go-around (balked landing) was initiated, - The throttle, after placement by the PIC (PF), could not be moved into ""ground idle"" or reverse, - The landing was not aborted after the plane had flown over the touchdown zone, - During the flare for landing the throttles of the engines were not selected to ""Flight Idle"", which was not noted by both pilots, - The flight crew flew the approach not in accordance with SOPs, and thereby pushing and even exceeding the limits. The following factors contributed to the accident: - Many non-precision approaches and landings at Mannheim City were not performed according to air carriers OMs, - The TRs and FOIs of the aircraft manufacturer were not incorporated into the OM/B and D of the air carrier, - The practical training of the flight crew by the air carrier was inadequate in terms of preventing an erroneous operation of the throttle control on the basis of the manufacturer of the Do 328-100 issued instructions, - The flight crew conducted a non-precision approach, which did not meet the procedural requirements of the OM of the air carrier and the AIP, - The design of the power lever was not forgiving enough, - The risks of existing problems in the operation of the power levers were not correctly identified and eliminated by by the relevant authorities and the relevant type certificate holder, in spite of several relevant events and various safety recommendations, - The touchdown zone in Mannheim was not marked, - The size and design of the safety area at the end of runway 27 was not sufficient to guarantee the operation of the flight within the safety levels set by ICAO and the legislator.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BFU Report number: BFU 1X001-08 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   Cirrus Airlines press release 19.03.2008   Location  Images: photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; MÃ¼nchen-Franz Josef Strauss Airport (MUC/EDDM); February 2007 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight from Madinah and the landing at Dhaka was uneventful. During the landing roll, approximately 50 seconds after touchdown, the flight crew received a call from the tower controller where the tower controller inquired whether the aircraft was under control. The flight crew responded to the call by stating that the aircraft was completely under control and asked what the problem seemed to be. The controller then informed the flight crew that fire was observed at the right wing area. At this point the Aerodrome Fire Operator had already activated the fire fighters as well as the rescue team. As soon as the controller had informed the flight crew about the fire, the flight crew received a No. 3 engine fire alarm. The co-pilot immediately discharged the first engine fire bottle and the flight crew requested fire fighter assistance and shut down all engines. The co-pilot waited 20 seconds until the second fire bottle was discharged. At this time the commander called the senior cabin attendant to the flight deck using the public address system (PA). This command was followed by a command to the cabin crew to remain seated. The commander informed the senior cabin attendant of the situation and instructed him to evaluate the situation and to evacuate the passengers if necessary. The senior cabin attendant went back down to the main deck and saw the smoke and the fire through the windows. He then commanded the cabin crew as well as passengers, by using a megaphone, to evacuate the aircraft. The cabin attendant at location L2 had already operated the emergency exit and started evacuating the passengers. Cabin attendants at locations L1 and R2 also operated their respective emergency exits. After realizing that smoke and fire were at the right hand side, the emergency exit at R2 was blocked by one of the cabin attendants. All passengers managed to evacuate without serious injuries and the fire department at Zia International Airport managed to extinguish the fire successfully. The damage to the aircraft was later evaluated as beyond economical repair. Findings as to causes and contributing factors - Incorrect assembly of the flexible half coupling at the front spar of engine No. 3. - Retaining ring missing in flexible half coupling at the front spar engine No. 3. - Lock wire fastened in such a way that the coupling nut might rotate slightly.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: RNF Report number: M-01508/AIG-04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) Harro Ranter; ZÃ¼rich-Kloten Airport (ZRH/LSZH); 30 August 1996 photo (c) Dale Coleman; Manchester Airport (MAN/EGCC); 08 May 2005 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The commander called for start at 14:17 and, at 14:20, was cleared to taxi to holding point A1 for a departure from runway 21. At 14:24, ATC instructed the crew to hold at A1 and cleared them for a LYDD 2 departure. At 14:34, one minute after becoming airborne, the co-pilot transmitted: ""And victor papa bravo golf echo er weÂre making an immediate turn to return to the airport immediate turn to the airport."" The tower controller replied: ""Victor golf echo join downwind right-hand runway two one, the biggin qnh one thousand, threshold elevationÂs five one seven feet, whatÂs the nature of your problem?"" The co-pilot replied: ""ere we donÂt know sir weÂre getting er engine vibration weÂll come straight back."" The aircraft then manoeuvred to overhead the airfield at approximately 1,200 ft aal heading towards the end of the downwind leg for a left-hand circuit to runway 21. As the aircraft left the overhead it commenced a continuous descent and, at 13:36 hrs, the co-pilot transmitted: ""And er victor golf echo we have major problem a major power problem it looks as though weÂre er going in weÂre going in!"" The aircraft flew extremely low over the roofs of several houses before its left wing impacted the roof of a house at the end of a residential close adjacent to a small wood. After the initial impact the aircraft struck the ground and caught fire destroying the attached garage of a neighbouring dwelling. Examination of the wreckage, however, did not reveal any evidence of pre-impact restrictions in the flight control circuits and examination of the engines, after disassembly, revealed no evidence of either engine having suffered a bird strike or foreign object damage. Furthermore, no pre-impact damage or failures were found in any of the rotating assemblies or main bearings. CONTRIBUTORY FACTORS: 1. It is probable that a mechanical failure within the air cycle machine caused the vibration which led to the crew attempting to return to the departure airfield. 2. A missing rivet head on the left engine fuel shut-off lever may have led to an inadvertent shut-down of that engine. 3. Approximately 70 seconds prior to impact neither engine was producing any thrust. 4. A relight attempt on the second engine was probably started before the relit first engine had reached idle speed, resulting in insufficient time for enough thrust to be developed to arrest the aircraftÂs rate of descent before ground impact.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: AAR 3/2010 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   AAIB Special Bulletin S2/2008  BBC News   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Kennedy International Airport (JFK),  New York.  The copilot (CP) was flying and air traffic control (ATC) was vectoring the airplane for an approach to a 10,000-foot long, 150-foot-wide runway, when an amber abnormal indicator light illuminated on the engine indicating and crew alert system (EICAS), indicating the hydraulic fluid on system A was low. The pilot-in-command (PIC) and the CP completed the checklist procedures down to the blow down of the landing gear. The flight crew did not follow the checklist sequence, and they did not evaluate the hydraulic pump to see if the hydraulic pump pressure could be restored. The flight crew turned on the A side pump, the power transfer unit was engaged, and the landing gear was lowered. The flight crew did not inform ATC of the loss of hydraulic fluid. The airplane touched down on the first 1,000 feet of runway 13L, and the CP informed the PIC that the brakes were not working. The PIC activated the emergency brakes one time, which appeared to work. The CP did not report any problems with nose wheel steering. The CP applied reverse thrust and the arm extend light illuminated on the right thrust reverser. The airplane started veering to the right and the CP could not maintain directional control. The PIC continued pulling the emergency brake handle as the airplane went off the right side of the runway, sheared off the left main landing gear, and came to a complete stop. Download of the EICAS system revealed the CP did not take the right thrust reverser out of reverse thrust. Review of airplane logbooks revealed the left hydraulic reservoir installed in the airplane was a repaired unit. The unit had been removed from another airplane due to an EICAS message stating it was empty when it was full. The switch was found to be out of adjustment. The unit was inspected and no anomalies were noted. Probable Cause: The co-pilot's failure to maintain directional control during the landing roll. Contributing to the accident was a loss of system A hydraulic fluid for undetermined reasons and the flight crew's failure to follow the checklist sequence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

At 23:25:54, the controller confirmed with the pilot that he was to turn left and at 23:25:59 the pilot once again acknowledged the left turn and added ""IÂve got a slight technical fault here"". No further transmissions were received from the pilot. The radar returns over the next 70 seconds showed the aircraft completed a left turn followed by a right turn before disappearing from radar. The Metro crashed into the sea.  On 12 May 2008, a significant wreckage field was identified. That wreckage was spread over an area approximately 1,200 m long and 400 m wide. CONTRIBUTING SAFETY FACTORS: - It was very likely that the aircraftÂs alternating current electrical power system was not energised at any time during the flight. - It was very likely that the aircraft became airborne without a functioning primary attitude reference or autopilot that, combined with the added workload of managing the Âslight technical faultÂ, led to pilot spatial disorientation and subsequent loss of control. OTHER SAFETY FACTORS: - The pilotÂs Metro III endorsement training was not conducted in accordance with the operatorÂs approved training and checking manual, with the result that the pilotÂs competence and ultimately, safety of the operation could not be assured. [Significant safety issue] - The chief pilot was performing the duties and responsibilities of several key positions in the operatorÂs organisational structure, increasing the risk of omissions in the operatorÂs training and checking requirements. - The conduct of the flight single-pilot increased the risk of errors of omission, such as not turning on or noticing the failure of aircraft items and systems, or complying with directions.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ATSB Report number: AO-2008-026 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: ATSB AO-2008-026   Location  Images: photo (c) ATSB; Sydney-Kingsford Smith International Airport, NSW (SYD); 09 April 2008 photo (c) ATSB; off Sydney-Kingsford Smith International Airport, NSW (SYD) photo (c) ATSB; off Sydney-Kingsford Smith International Airport, NSW (SYD) photo (c) ATSB photo (c) ATSB photo (c) ATSB photo (c) ATSB photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Sydney-Kingsford Smith International Airport, NSW (SYD/YSSY); April 2000 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The commercial pilot and three passengers were not injured. The personal flight departed from Lincoln Regional Airport, California, about 08:54, with a planned destination of Carlsbad. At the time of the accident, the pilot had canceled his instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan, and was executing a visual flight rules (VFR) approach to runway 24 in visual meteorological conditions.  As the airplane approached the destination airport, the pilot selected vertical speed mode on the autopilot. While descending, the copilot's Primary Flight Display (PFD) began to flicker. About 5 minutes later, as the airplane transitioned through 28,000 feet mean sea level, the left PFD flashed a ""PFT"" alert indicating that the autopilot had disconnected. The pilot said he immediately felt heavy control forces on the control yoke that he had to exert to fly the airplane. Shortly thereafter, the pilot discovered that the electric pitch trim was not operational. While hand-flying the airplane the pilot entered instrument meteorological conditions as the airplane descended through a 2,400-foot-thick cloud layer. Thereafter, the pilot continued a visual approach to the 4,897-foot-long runway. The pilot noted that he was overwhelmed with the electrical failures and fatigued from maneuvering the airplane by hand for such a long duration (which he approximated was around 45 minutes). The airplane crossed the runway threshold about 15 knots faster than the correct landing speed and the airplane touched down past the midpoint of the runway. The pilot realized that despite his braking attempts the airplane was going to continue off the runway surface over a small downsloping cliff at the end. He determined that he would not be able to abort the landing due to the airplane's diminished ground speed and elected to perform a 180-degree turn. The airplane ground looped, coming to rest in a dirt area south of the runway; the main landing gear collapsed and the flaps folded under the wings. According to the pilot, he never attempted to reset the autopilot system. The autopilot was designed for an automatic disengagement when there is a system failure, invalid sensor data, or yaw damper failure. On the manufacturer's current Pilots' Abbreviated Checklist, Emergency Procedures section, it states that if the autopilot preflight test fail warning (red ""PFT"" warning on the PFD) illuminates, the pilot should reset the associated circuit breaker to clear the fault. A post-accident examination of the airplane's systems revealed no mechanical malfunctions or failures, with the exception of a flickering PFD screen. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The pilot's misjudgment of speed and distance, resulting in an overshoot of the runway. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's failure to follow the Autopilot Preflight Test Fail checklist and his distraction with a flickering primary flight display screen.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: LAX08FA117 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Four crew members and seven passengers sustained serious injuries. Iran Air Flight IR235 was a scheduled service from Tehran to Shiraz. The co-pilot, who was Pilot Flying, performed a walk around prior to departure. Since it had been snowing and temperatures were around freezing level, he requested de-icing. Because there were a number of aircraft already waiting for de-icing, the pilot in command decided not to perform de-icing. The engines were started and the airplane started taxying towards the departure runway at 07:09 hours. At 07:31 the flight was cleared for takeoff. The aircraft rolled left wing down shortly after lift off. The left wingtip touched the ground. Thereafter the aircraft rolled momentarily back to a more neutral position. A few seconds later, while losing altitude, the second left wing down roll started. The left wing touched the ground and when the aircraft rolled back to a more neutral attitude both main landing gears touched the ground. All gears broke off and the aircraft slid on the area next to the runway. Reportedly, during the impact or shortly thereafter all electrical power was lost. When the aircraft came to rest, a fire developed, starting from the left wing root towards the fuselage. All passengers and crew were evacuated through the two right over wing emergency exits. Cause: It is believed that the accident was caused by the crew fault that has not decided to de-ice aircraft, which led to wing contamination and finally aircraft has stalled during take off.

The pilot, co-pilot, 3 flight attendants, and 68 passengers on board were not injured. The airplane received substantial damage. The flight originated from New York-LaGuardia Airport (LGA), at 06:18. The accident flight was the first one for the airplane after having maintenance performed on the number two (right) engine during the previous evening. The first officer reported he used a flashlight when conducting his preflight inspection of the airplane as it was still dark outside. He reported the engine cowlings were flush, and he did not see any ""hanging"" cowl latches when he looked underneath the engines. The captain reported that the logbooks indicated the number two engine vibration monitor had been replaced during the previous night. He reported the preflight, taxi, and takeoff were normal. The captain reported that during climb out the cockpit received a call from the lead flight attendant who informed them that a passenger reported that the number two engine cowling was flapping after takeoff. A pilot-passenger who was sitting behind this passenger reportedly did not see the cowling move, nor did the flight attendants when they looked out the window. The captain reported he then began to monitor the N1 vibration indications on the number two engine. He reported that the number two engine vibration was approximately double the indication from the number one engine, but the indicator was not flashing nor had it turned amber. During cruise flight the number two engine vibration decreased to equal that of the number one engine. The captain reported that about 20 minutes after they leveled off, the airplane shuddered as if flying through wake turbulence. He reported the remainder of the flight was normal until they were taxiing after landing and the lead flight attendant called the cockpit stating that ""part of the right engine had come off."" The first officer called ground control to warn them that there might be debris on the runway. The crew then shut down the number two engine and taxied to the gate.  The pilot of another airplane later reported seeing part of the engine cowling come off when flight 853 was on a 1-mile final. The other half of the engine cowling was found on the runway and was contacted by an airplane that landed after the accident airplane.  Contract maintenance personnel reported they changed the N1 sensor on the number two engine during the evening prior to the accident. They reported they then shut the fan cowling, but did not latch it as they still needed to perform an engine run and check for leaks. After the engine run was performed, one of the mechanics thought that the other had latched the fan cowling when in fact he had not. While they were doing another task in the cockpit, another mechanic asked for help at another gate. The mechanics left the accident airplane to assist the other mechanic. Neither mechanic returned to the accident airplane to either latch or verify that the fan cowling had been latched.  The maintenance log stated the N1 speed sensor was removed and replaced in accordance with aircraft maintenance manual (AMM) 77-11-10. This section of the AMM states, ""Close the fan cowl doors (Ref. AMM TASK 71-13-00-410-040)."" According to the maintenance personnel, this task was not completed prior to the airplane being returned to service.  The separated cowling contacted the right side of the horizontal stabilizer which resulted in substantial damage to the stabilizer. In addition, the fan cowl doors, number two engine pylon, the number two engine reverser, and the right wing number one slat were damaged. The separation of the engine cowling which resulted from maintenance personnel failing to follow maintenance procedures in that they did not latch the engine cowling following the maintenance inspection.  A factor associated with the accident was their attention was divereted from the task when another mechanic asked for assistance.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CHI08LA071 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

It was scheduled to arrive at Lihue at 05:15. The pilot had routine contact with air traffic control, and was advised by the controller to maintain 6,000 feet at 05:01 when the airplane was 11 miles from the destination airport. Two minutes later the flight was cleared for a visual approach to follow a preceding Boeing 737 (Aloha Airlines Flight 917) and advised to switch to the common traffic advisory frequency at the airport. The pilot altered his flight course to the west, most likely for spacing from the airplane ahead, and descended into the water as he began a turn back toward the airport. The majority of the wreckage sank in 4,800 feet of water. The pilot most likely descended into the ocean because he became spatially disoriented. Although visual meteorological conditions prevailed, no natural horizon and few external visual references were available during the visual approach. This increased the importance of monitoring flight instruments to maintain awareness of the airplane attitude and altitude. The pilot's tasks during the approach, however, included maintaining visual separation from the airplane ahead and lining up with the destination runway. These tasks required visual attention outside the cockpit. These competing tasks probably created shifting visual frames of reference, left the pilot vulnerable to common visual and vestibular illusions, and reduced his awareness of the airplane's attitude, altitude and trajectory.

Initially the approach progressed normally, with the Autopilot and Autothrottle engaged, until the aircraft was at a height of approximately 600 ft and 2 miles from touch down. The aircraft then descended rapidly and struck the ground, some 1,000 ft short of the paved runway surface, just inside the airfield boundary fence. The aircraft stopped on the very beginning of the paved surface of runway 27L. During the short ground roll the right main landing gear separated from the wing and the left main landing gear was pushed up through the wing root. A significant amount of fuel leaked from the aircraft but there was no fire. An emergency evacuation via the slides was supervised by the cabin crew and all occupants left the aircraft, some receiving minor injuries. Initial indications from the interviews and Flight Recorder analyses show the flight and approach to have progressed normally until the aircraft was established on late finals for runway 27L. At approximately 600 ft and 2 miles from touch down, the Autothrottle demanded an increase in thrust from the two engines but the engines did not respond. Following further demands for increased thrust from the Autothrottle, and subsequently the flight crew moving the throttle levers, the engines similarly failed to respond. The aircraft speed reduced and the aircraft descended onto the grass short of the paved runway surface. CAUSAL FACTORS: Whilst on approach to London (Heathrow) from Beijing, China, at 720 feet agl, the right engine of G-YMMM ceased responding to autothrottle commands for increased power and instead the power reduced to 1.03 Engine Pressure Ratio (EPR). Seven seconds later the left engine power reduced to 1.02 EPR. This reduction led to a loss of airspeed and the aircraft touching down some 330 m short of the paved surface of Runway 27L at London Heathrow. The investigation identified that the reduction in thrust was due to restricted fuel flow to both engines. It was determined that this restriction occurred on the right engine at its FOHE. For the left engine, the investigation concluded that the restriction most likely occurred at its FOHE. However, due to limitations in available recorded data, it was not possible totally to eliminate the possibility of a restriction elsewhere in the fuel system, although the testing and data mining activity carried out for this investigation suggested that this was very unlikely. Further, the likelihood of a separate restriction mechanism occurring within seven seconds of that for the right engine was determined to be very low. The investigation identified the following probable causal factors that led to the fuel flow restrictions: 1) Accreted ice from within the fuel system released, causing a restriction to the engine fuel flow at the face of the FOHE, on both of the engines. 2) Ice had formed within the fuel system, from water that occurred naturally in the fuel, whilst the aircraft operated with low fuel flows over a long period and the localised fuel temperatures were in an area described as the Âsticky rangeÂ. 3) The FOHE, although compliant with the applicable certification requirements, was shown to be susceptible to restriction when presented with soft ice in a high concentration, with a fuel temperature that is below -10Â°C and a fuel flow above flight idle. 4) Certification requirements, with which the aircraft and engine fuel systems had to comply, did not take account of this phenomenon as the risk was unrecognised at that time.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: AAIB Report  1/2010 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) Marc-Antony Payne; London-Heathrow Airport (LHR/EGLL); 17 January 2008; (CC:by) photo (c) unknown; London-Heathrow Airport (LHR/EGLL); May 2008 photo (c) Patrick Kirinus; London-Heathrow Airport (LHR/EGLL); 17 June 2007 photo (c) Udo Kirinus; London-Heathrow Airport (LHR/EGLL); 05 May 2002 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The plane was carrying 36 attendees, returning from the 50th Annual Aviation Safety Conference held in Warsaw.  Nine attendees deplaned at Powidz and eleven at PoznÃ¡n-Krzesiny AB. It took off from Krzesiny at 18:24. Weather at Miroslawiec was poor with a ceiling at 300 feet and a visibility 2 sm in mist. The crew were cleared for a PAR approach to runway 12/30. The approach was unstabilized.  On finals, the left bank reached 76 deg and pitch reached -21 degrees. The aircraft hit the ground 1300 m from runway 30 threshold and 320 meters left of extended runway centerline. The aircraft impacted terrain in left sideslip, on heading 220 deg (runway heading was 304 deg), disintegrated and partially burnt. Rate of descent at the moment of ground impact reached approx 6000 feet/min and the ground speed was 148 knots. The aircraft's landing gear was extended and flaps were at 15 degrees setting, at impact. PRIMARY CAUSE: Inadvertent loss of spatial and situational awareness by the aircraft crew during final stages of PAR approach, which, within 12 seconds period before crash, resulted in the aircraftÂs bank increasing unmonitored and accompanying altitude loss, while the flight crew apparently was trying to establish visual contact with runway and approach lights. Among the secondary causes the Board listed: * Improper flight crew selection for the flight:   - The PIC did not have any previous experience on this version of CASA C-295 aircraft, which was additionally equipped with 2 IRS/GPS LN-100G units instead of 2 TOPSTAR 100-2 GPS receivers, and, ironically, with EGPWS Mk. V - unfortunately lack of cryptographic modules in GPS receivers, which made IRS/GPS LN-100G system almost useless (IRS alone with no GPS enhancement) caused flight crew to use handheld GPS receivers (Garmin GPSMAP 196),   - The SIC was not rated in CASA C-295 aircraft for night/IMC operations, * Poor flight crew coordination and cooperation (poor MCC & CRM): 	- improper altimeter setting procedures, 	- probably both pilots were looking for visual cues and nobody was observing flight instruments in the very last seconds before they crash), * Poor weather conditions in vicinity of Miroslawiec AB; ceiling 300 feet, visibility 2 sm, in mist. Icing was excluded as a factor. * Spatial disorientation of the flight crew, * EGPWS Audio warning was inhibited (the flight crew missed EGPWS test before departure from Warsaw, even though it was a checklist item, and never corrected the problem - the PIC was not familiar with the system - he has never flown before CASA C-295M equipped with EGPWS) - in result no audio warning of excessive bank angle, high terrain closure rate and high sink rate was available to the flight crew, as well as no automatic height above ground callouts were given, * The flight crew failed to monitor radio-altimeter indication during both approaches, * Both pilots concentrated their attention outside of the cockpit during final seconds before crash and did not scan flight instruments. * The military PAR controller did a poor job during the approach, he let for the non-stabilized approach, he was not compensating properly for left crosswind of 20 kts and allowed the aircraft to stay high above glide slope during both PAR approaches, he also was not fully aware of altimeter setting (QNH or QFE) and altitude reports by flight crewÂ improper values QNH/QFE were used by the flight crew during first approach, additionally PIC has set his altimeter to QFE, while SIC to QNH. During the approach the controllerÂs instructions were hesitant and inconsistent, probably making the flight crew to believe their approach was going well. * The military PAR controller was giving improper suggestions to the flight crew - he was questioning them during final stage of approach whether they see approach or runway lights or not, instead of continuous talking them down to the runway threshold, * Altimeter indications were improperly interpreted by the flight crew, * Improperly performed search for visual contact by the flight crew during final stage of approach, * Improper, lacking weather situation analysis performed by the PIC before the flight, * The flight crew did not properly set DH/MDA (they did the same error on previous two legs before crash). Contributing factors were: * The SIC was not rated in CASA C-295 aircraft for night/IMC operations (the SIC total flight time was 800 hours including 100 hours in CASA C-295M), * The PIC has no previous experience on the accident version of CASA C-295 aircraft, (although he logged 800+ hours in another version of CASA C-295M aircraft used by Polish AF and his total flight time was 2500 hours), * Because of lack of GPS enhancement to IRS, the flight crew used Garmin GPSMAP 196 handheld GPS receiver, * The PIC had no previous experience in PAR approaches in IMC, close to minimums, which in Miroslawiec AB were reported to be aprox. ceiling 270 feet and visibility of 3300 feet, * The milSources: BBC  Polish Air Force   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

However, the airline that used the hangar needed to house a plane. Since they had priority, the Citation was taken out of the hangar about 16:30 and moved back to the ramp area. While the airplane was on the ramp, the weather condition had turned from light snow to freezing rain. The pilot and her passenger arrived at the airport about 17:15. About 1730, the airplane's engines were started and the airplane was observed taxing. The FBO representative heard the pilot's announcements over the radio in the FBO. He also noticed the airplane was not on the taxiway, but on the grass area on the south side of the asphalt taxiway. At that time the ground was covered with snow and ice. The FBO representative noted the pilot did not activate the airport's taxi and runways lights via the common airport frequency radio channel. It was observed that the airplane taxied through a ditch, which was covered with ice and snow. The airplane's engines were heard at a high rate of power about this time. It was later discovered that the airplane's left main tire broke through the ice and became stuck in the ditch. The airplane continued on the grass area after the high engine power was heard. The FBO representative heard the pilot announce the wrong runway (runway 35) that she was planning to depart from. The FBO representative turned on the runway and taxi lights after hearing the incorrect runway announcement. The pilot later announced a change of departure from runway 35 to runway 17, while the airplane was observed back taxing on runway 26 onto taxiway ""C"". About 17:45 the airplane took off from runway 17. After takeoff, the pilot contacted the Air Traffic Controller (ATC) and reported that she was at 1,000 feet, climbing to 10,000 feet. About one minute later, the pilot declared an emergency and stated, ""We've got an attitude indicator failure"". About seven seconds later, the pilot announced over the frequency they were not certain which way they were turning. Radar contact was lost shortly after that.

The pilot reported to the control tower at Nassau that he was having problems with the landing gear and wished to continue flying while attempting to troubleshoot and apply emergency gear extension procedures. The aircraft departed the traffic area after permission was granted. According to the pilots, the aircraft continued to the west of Nassau where the emergency procedures were performed. Despite following the emergency gear extension procedures, the crew could not get the gear to extend. The crew then decided to return to Nassau. The crew landed using the emergency gear extension checklist that addressed landing with one gear not extended. The pilot reported that âdespite following the checklist,â the aircraft was not able to maintain directional control upon touchdown and this resulted in a runway excursion. The aircraft touchdown point was approximately 6,500ft from the threshold of Runway 09. Several runway lights, runway marking sign and the Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) were damaged by the aircraft on landing roll-out. The aircraft came to rest slightly to the right of Intersection Kilo (K) approximately 200 feet to the right of Runway 09.  There were no reported injuries to passengers or crew at the scene.  Probable Cause Probable cause has been determined as detachment of the right main landing gear door aft hinge attachment. (The locking wire which secures the gear door attachment bolt in place was found broken which allowed the attachment bolt to disengage. Once the bolt disengaged the aft door hinge detached from its secure position resulting in the movement of the hinge. This may have resulted in the hinge jamming the gear door resulting in the right main landing gear failure). Contributing Factors Pilot action/error has been largely attributed to the cause of this accident in that; 1. The right landing gear door position light illuminated on the Annunciator Panel. The pilot in command went outside and closed the door. Based on his admissions he did not report this defect to maintenance nor did he complete the appropriate technical log entry. (Had the pilot following the appropriate procedures for reporting mechanical irregularities this accident may have been avoided). 2. The pilot in command was in a hurry to get home. When the accident investigators arrived at the scene the PIC had already left for his next job. (Get-home-itis) (This was evidenced as the PIC by telephone called later to say he could not stay at the scene as he had to get to his other job.)Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: DCABah Report number:  Status: Preliminary reportDuration: 1 monthDownload report:  Preliminary report Sources: DCA  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates30-May-2023 20:29 harro Added 30-May-2023 20:34 harro Updated Corrections or additions? ...

The cabin of the aircraft was configured for cargo operations with no passenger seats fitted, as the only other planned occupant was the operatorÂs Chief Engineer, who would be sitting beside the commander in the right hand seat. However, the commander asked the operator if he could take a family member with him to SXM. The operator agreed and an extra seat was fitted. Witnesses stated that the commander appeared ""rushed"" prior to departure. The commander stated that he partially carried out the normal pre-flight inspection. He then started the engines. Before taxiing he realised that the nose landing gear chocks were still in place so he shut down the left hand engine, removed and stowed the chocks and then restarted the left engine. The aircraft took off from runway 10 at 14:15 hrs. At between 100 ft and 150 ft the commander initiated a left turn but after some initial movement the ailerons jammed. When he discovered that he was unable to straighten the ailerons he attempted to return to land on runway 10. The other flight controls did not appear to be restricted. With the ailerons jammed, the aircraft continued to turn to the left, losing altitude as it flew over a settlement to the north of the aerodrome, until pointed directly at the Air Traffic Control tower, causing the Air Traffic Control Officer (ATCO) to abandon the tower. The commander judged that the aircraft was too fast and high to attempt a landing and therefore initiated a go-around, applying full power. He continued the left turn, losing height and speed to position the aircraft for another approach but, as the aircraft descended over the northern edge of the runway, its left wing struck the perimeter fence. On impact the aircraft spun about its vertical axis with its wings level and continued sliding sideways on its right side for approximately 80 ft before coming to rest facing north-west. CONCLUSIONS: ""The commander was probably distracted from his normal duties whilst arranging additional seating to accommodate the second passenger. He did not complete the requisite pre-flight check or the subsequent check of full and free movement of the flight controls, either of which would have revealed an obstruction to proper operation of the ailerons.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: AAIB Bulletin 2/2009 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Vancouver International Airport, BC (YVR/CYVR); August 1993 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The weather conditions at Edinburgh Airport were wintry with snowfall, which required the aircraft to be de-iced. Shortly after both engines had been started, the commander signalled to the marshaller to remove the Ground Power Unit (GPU) from the aircraft, which was facing nose out from its stand, down a slight slope. As the marshaller went to assist his colleague to remove the GPU to a safe distance prior to the aircraft taxiing off the stand, the aircraft started to move forward slowly, forcing them to run to safety. The flight crew, who were looking into the cockpit, were unaware that the aircraft was moving. It continued to move forward until its right propeller struck the GPU, causing substantial damage to the GPU, the propeller and the engine. The ground crew were uninjured. CONCLUSION: ""The aircraft moved forward inadvertently after engine start, causing its right propeller to strike a GPU. Possible explanations include that the parking brake was not set, the chocks had slipped from the nosewheel, or the chocks were removed prematurely. There was insufficient evidence to determine which of these scenarios was the most likely. Contributory factors were: the aircraft was facing down a slight downslope, the ramp was slippery due to the weather conditions and the flight crew increased engine speed to top up the pneumatic system pressure. The airport operatorÂs instructions contained in MDD 04/07 required aircraft facing nose-out on North Cargo Apron stands to be towed onto the taxiway centreline, prior to starting engines. Had these instructions been complied with, the accident would probably have been avoided.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: AAIB Bulletin 2/2009 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  1 July 2000 G-JEAP Channel Express 0 Coventry-Baginton Airport (CVT) sub 7 May 2004 G-CEXG Channel Express 0 Bournemouth International Airport (BOH/EGHH) min Location  Images: photo (c) AAIB; Edinburgh-Turnhouse Airport (EDI); February 2008 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Around 10:59, a ground handler, stopped in a vehicle near parking area S31 to let the Boeing 777 pass, saw the fairing of the right main landing gear's nose wheel detach. The fairing fell off and rolled to the left of taxiway A. Sparks and smoke appeared from the right nose wheel of the right main landing gear. The ground handler, whose vehicle was not equipped with a radio, followed the aircraft and asked another agent to inform air traffic control services. At 11:02:59, while the aircraft was on taxiway B, the ground controller informed the crew that they had been informed about a metal part left at their parking area. The controller also instructed the crew to turn left and stop. The crew did not understand the meaning of the Ground controller's message. At 11:03:38, the SOL controller asked the crew to continue taxiing to holding point 27L and informed them that he would call them back to stop. The crew was uncertain whether they should continue taxiing to the 27L runway holding point or stop. At 11:04:11, as the aircraft turned left onto taxiway Y11 leading to the Y11 holding point of runway 27L, the SOL controller instructed the crew not to proceed to the holding point but to take the first taxiway. The PF then decided to turn onto taxiway Q. At 11:04:48, the co-pilot contacted the ground handling staff to try to gather more information. At 11:05:31, the crew of a Continental Air Lines B757, following the B777 during taxi, informed the Ground controller that a tire on one of the Boeing 777's wheels had caught fire and requested assistance from the fire brigade. They also informed the B777 crew on the Ground frequency. At 11:06:12, the captain of the Boeing 777 ordered the evacuation. The aircraft was then located on taxiway Q at Y12. The 125 passengers and crew members evacuated through the slide rafts of the eight aircraft doors. Two cabin crew members were injured during the evacuation through door 2L. The intervention of the firefighters successfully extinguished the fire. An examination of the wheel and its components was conducted by Boeing. It showed that two identical bearings had been installed in the internal and external positions on the right main landing gear's nose wheel. The wheel spindle of the Boeing 777 is conical, and the internal and external bearings are not interchangeable. The bearing installed in the external position was identified as an internal wheel bearing. It was not possible to identify how an internal bearing could have been installed in place of an external bearing.Sources: https://bea.aero/en/investigation-reports/notified-events/detail/feu-au-niveau-du-train-principal-droit-au-cours-du-roulage-vers-la-piste-evacuation-durgence/ History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  20 February 2021 N772UA United Airlines 0 near Denver International Airport (DEN/KDEN), Denver, CO min Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates02-Jun-2023 17:53 harro Added Corrections or additions? ...

The copilot was the handling pilot for the descent, approach and landing at Darwin and the pilot in command was the monitoring pilot. The crew had received a weather briefing prior to the departure from Cairns, informing them that there were showers and thunderstorms in the Darwin area for their arrival. Air traffic control (ATC) cleared the crew to conduct the Darwin runway 29 ILS approach. The monitoring pilot stated that the runway was in sight prior to flying over the Howard Springs non-directional beacon (NDB). Information from the aircraftÂs flight data recorder (FDR) indicated that the aircraft flew over the Howard Springs NDB at about 3,000 ft above mean sea level (AMSL), with a computed air speed of 221 knots. The aircraft was configured for landing at the outer marker, where the handling pilot disconnected the autopilot and the approach was flown manually by reference to the ILS and visual reference with the runway lighting. During the approach and landing, the aircraft autothrottle remained engaged. At approximately 700 ft AMSL, the aircraft entered a rain shower. The monitoring pilot switched on the windscreen wipers and, as both pilots stated that they could see the runway lighting and PAPI, the approach was continued. At approximately 30 ft radio altitude, the FDR recorded a rate of descent of approximately 1,000 ft/min at the same time as an abrupt control column nose up command was applied. The copilot recalled hearing the synthesised calls of radio altitude from the aircraftÂs radar altimeter. At 21:14:50, the aircraft touched down with a rate of descent of about 1,000 ft/min, which resulted in a hard impact with the runway prior to the 300 m runway markings. The aircraft then bounced before settling onto the runway. The crew completed the landing rollout and taxied the aircraft to the terminal. CONTRIBUTING SAFETY FACTORS: - The aircraft was above the glideslope at the Howard Springs non-directional beacon and throughout the majority of the approach, resulting in high rates of descent on several occasions as attempts were made to capture the glideslope. - The copilot disconnected the autopilot at a time of high workload. - The aircraft's rate of descent below 400 ft above aerodrome level exceeded the operatorÂs stabilised approach criteria; however, because the pilot in command considered the exceedance to be momentary, a missed approach was not conducted. - The allowance of momentary excursions in the aircraft operatorÂs stabilised approach criteria that were caused by wind gusts or turbulence increased risk by permitting flight crew discretion to continue approaches at or beyond those criteria. [Minor safety issue] - The operatorÂs procedure for the use of the autothrottle in response to high rates of descent when below 30 ft during landing was not included in the operatorÂs standard operating procedures. [Minor safety issue] - At about 30 ft, the copilot made an abrupt rearward movement of the control column resulting in the main landing gear moving faster downwards than the aircraftÂs overall rate of descent. OTHER SAFETY FACTORS: - The operatorÂs process for reporting 717 pilot training issues to senior managers was not utilised by all flight crew, reducing the potential for the communication of fleet-wide issues to all 717 crews. [Minor safety issue] - There was no clear division of responsibilities between the aircraft operator and the third party training provider in regard to ensuring the standards of flight training met all of the operatorÂs requirements, which had the potential to reduce training effectiveness. [Minor safety issue] - There was no provision in the current Civil Aviation Safety Authority regulations or orders regarding third party flight crew training providers, with the effect that the responsibility for training outcomes was unclear. [Minor safety issue] - There was no aircraft operatorÂs or manufacturerÂs 717 pilot training manual that provided for the standardisation of instructional technique and provided a reference document for pilots during and following training. [Minor safety issue] - The control column moved forward after touchdown, resulting in excessive weight transfer to the nosewheel before the right mainwheel was correctly loaded. - After touchdown, the thrust levers were advanced, inadvertently cancelling the deployment of the ground spoilers and resulting in unstable conditions while transitioning from flight to the ground. - The aircraft operator's Route Manual did not include all relevant information on the potential for visual illusions during a night approach to runway 29 at Darwin Airport that would have improved the awareness of flight crews. [Minor safety issue] - The Jeppesen-Sanderson Inc. approach chart titled Darwin, NT Australia ILS-Z or LOC-Z Rwy 29 dated 21 SEP 07 incorrectly depicted a level flight segment after the Howard Springs non-directional beacon that could have been misinterpreted by flight crews. [Minor safety issue] - The lack of runway centreline lighting reduced the available visual cues during the latter stages of the approach and landing to runway 29 at Darwin Airport.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ATSB Report number: AO-2008-007 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Qantas safety record under threat (News.com.au 12-2-2008)  ATSB Occurrence 200800641 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  2 May 2011 VH-NXE Qantas 0 Perth Airport, WA (PER/YPPH) min Location  Images: photo (c) Bill Mallinson; Perth Airport, WA (PER/YPPH); 17 October 2015 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Destination was Santiago de Los Caballeros, with nine tourists on board. On the return flight, at approximately 70 miles northwest of the Punta Cana Airport, the captain decided to fly to the La Romana Airport (the alternate airport), to refuel because he did not perform this operation at the Cibao Airport and because the fuel quantity indicator in the left tank was inoperative. He had doubts about the remaining fuel in the tanks. On the way to the alternate airport, the no.1 engine failed. The captain attempt to restart the engine but this failed. Engine no. 2 was still running. The pilot, aware that the fault that turned off engine no.1 was the lack of fuel, made the decision to land in a sugarcane field near El Prado, located in the province of El Seybo, for fear that the remaining engine would also go out, perhaps without a suitable place to land later. Given these conditions, the captain chose a segment of a lane in the middle of two cane fields, where he made the emergency landing. The surface of this trail was not totally flat. After having a landing run of about 100 feet, the nose wheel collided with a stone, breaking the nose landing gear. Directional control was lost and the aircraft turned to the left, entering a cane field. Cause: - The accident occurred due to the fact that engine # 1 was turned off due to lack of fuel and when making the emergency landing the captain could not keep the aircraft in the correct path of the selected lane for said landing.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIAA Dom.

He stated the airplane touched down at the ""beginning"" of the runway and his speed at touchdown was approximately 100 knots. As the airplane touched down on the runway, the braking was ""adequate"" and the airplane decelerated ""normally."" At approximately the mid-field position of the runway, the braking became increasingly less effective until braking was ""near nil,"" and the airplane was no longer decelerating. The pilot maneuvered the airplane off the left side of the runway to gain traction from the grass area between the runway and the parallel taxiway.

About 0930, the captain transmitted to air traffic control (ATC) that the flight was climbing through 11,700 feet to its cruise altitude of flight level (FL) 210 (approximately 21,000 feet mean sea level.) The controller acknowledged the transmission and cleared the flight to proceed to an intersection along the flight route located about 29 miles north-northwest of the destination airport, and the flight crew acknowledged. At 0933, during cruise flight, the controller repeated the navigational clearance, which the flight crew acknowledged, and the airplane turned in accordance with the clearance. At 0940, the controller instructed the flight to change radio frequencies, and there was no response. The controller continued to try to contact the flight crew multiple times but received no reply. At 0951, the airplane crossed the intersection that was its clearance limit then turned southeast toward the destination airport without descending, which is consistent with the airplane being on autopilot. The controller handling the flight asked another controller to attempt to contact the flight crew on a different frequency, but there was still no response, and the flight proceeded on a southeasterly heading at FL 210. About 0955, the flight crossed over the destination airport and continued on a southeasterly course without changing altitude or heading. Two separate airline crews in the area attempted to contact the incident crew, but neither flight crewsâ attempts were successful.  About 0958, when the flight was about 26 nautical miles southeast of the destination airport, the captain contacted the controller with an abbreviated call sign (âAh HCF ten zero twoâ), and the controller asked if the flight crew was experiencing an emergency. The captain responded, ""No, we must have missed a hand off or missed a call or something."" The controller then issued instructions for the flight to return to the destination airport, with which the flight crew complied. The flight arrived without further incident about 1015.  The captain and first officer both reported to their company that they had unintentionally fallen asleep in flight. The fact that both pilots fell asleep during the midmorning hours, a time of day normally associated with wakefulness and rising alertness, indicates that both pilots were fatigued.  The captain had undiagnosed severe obstructive sleep apnea, which was diagnosed during a medical evaluation shortly after this incident and for which symptoms (such as snoring) and risk factors (such as obesity) were present before the incident. This condition likely caused him to experience chronic daytime fatigue and contributed to his falling asleep during the incident flight.  Probable Cause: The captain and first officer inadvertently falling asleep during the cruise phase of flight. Contributing to the incident were the captain's undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea and the flight crewâs recent work schedules, which included several consecutive days of early-morning start times.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: SEA08IA080 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates23-Oct-2016 16:13 harro Added 03-Nov-2018 20:40 ASN Update Bot Updated [Time, Operator, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, Accident report, ]03-Nov-2018 20:42 harro Updated [Location, Narrative, ]09-Jun-2023 14:36 Ron Averes Updated Corrections or additions? ...

All three crew members and eighteen passengers survived the accident. The airplane arrived as flight BRU1833 from Minsk-2 International Airport (MSQ), Belarus at 02:05. Refueling was carried out in preparation for the return flight and the crew conducted the flight planning. After refueling the pilot carried out a tactile and visual inspection of all critical surfaces of the wing and visual inspection of the tail assembly. All the planes were clean and dry. The weather reported for the 04:00 was: wind 110 degrees at the ground 1 m/sec, visibility 3500 meters, haze, small clouds, vertical visibility of 800 meters, scattered clouds at 3000 m, a temperature of minus 3Â° C, dew point minus 4Â° C, pressure 1019 hPa.  At 04:08 both engines were started. The engine air intake heating (cowl anti-ice) was switched on but the wing anti-icing system was not switched on. The crew taxied to runway 27 and were cleared for departure. During takeoff the airplane progressively banked left until the left wing tip contacted runway. The airplane went off the side with the airplane rolling the right. The right hand wing broke off and spilled fuel caught fire. The airplane came to rest upside down. CONCLUSION (translated from Russian): The accident involving aircraft CRJ-100LR registration number EW-101PJ was the result of an asymmetric loss of lift of the wing during take-off, which led to the toppling of the aircraft immediately after liftoff from the runway, the left wing tip contacting the ground, the subsequent destruction and fire. The reason for the loss of lift of the wing at the actual weather conditions, was the formation of frost, which ""pollutes"" the surface of the wing. The cause of formation of frost, most likely, was the fuel icing, while the aircraft was parked at the airport and during taxiing for the return flight, resulting in a difference in temperature of the surrounding air and cold fuel in the tanks after the flight. The situation could be aggravated when exceeding the values recommended by the operations manual of the angular velocity when lifting the nose wheel during takeoff with ""contaminated"" wings when it is impossible to monitor this parameter instrumentally. Existing procedural methods of control of the aerodynamic surfaces of the aircraft before departure, along with the inefficiency, during takeoff, the existing system of protection from stalling due to increased sensitivity of the wing, even to a slight contamination of the leading edge, can not fully guarantee the prevention of similar accidents in future. An Airworthiness Directive on the need to include anti-icing systems on the wing in the final stage of taxiing at the actual weather conditions was issued by Transport Canada after the accident. This probably could have prevented the accident.Sources: MAK Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC)  Reuters  Belavia press release   Location  Images: photo (c) Interstate Aviation Committee; Yerevan-Zvartnots Airport (EVN); February 2008 photo (c) Interstate Aviation Committee; Yerevan-Zvartnots Airport (EVN); February 2008 photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG/LFPG); January 2008 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The copilot gave his place on board to a passenger without any qualification to operate the aircraft, moments after takeoff. During the en-route flight phase, the secondary pitch trim system was activated, which would have resulted in an abnormal operation of the system, followed by violent loss of altitude and over speed condition. Possible Causes: Absence of Crew Coordination and disregard of the Co-pilot's command post responsibilities. * The flight was performed, at least during the last 32 minutes, by the pilot in command with the aircraft passenger in the co-pilot's seat. In this condition, it does not comply with RAV 60.2(a) and 60.10 (b), (e) and (d). In these circumstances, it was not possible to effectively perform emergency procedures for this condition, since the passenger was not capable of performing them. - Conscious modification of flight conditions. - The aircraft was in cruise, straight and level flight. The condition was altered by the actuation of the Secondary Trim Switch, which was not required for this flight condition, since this is an Emergency Trim System, in case the Primary System, presents a failure. - Abnormal operation of the Horizontal Stabilizer Pitch Trim System. - When the Horizontal Stabilizer Pitch Trim Secondary System double switch was actuated, it triggered an abnormal operation of the aircraft's horizontal stabilizer trim system with runaway characteristics (Trim Runaway) and almost immediately caused an over-speed condition. This failure, which could have been of an electrical or mechanical nature, could not be solved according to the emergency procedures that could have been executed, as described in the AFM section 111, which inhibited the recovery of the aircraft and caused the impact against the ground with high speed and thrust.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JIAAC Venezuela Report number: 010/2008 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: NotiSAR  Report A-149/CENIPA/2015   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The captain said he broke out of the cloud base about 1,200 feet msl, 7 miles from the runway. He said he was holding about 15 to 20 degrees of left crab to remain aligned with the runway centerline, and he felt a strong crosswind over the runway threshold. During the landing flare, the left wingtip fuel tank contacted the runway. The captain applied full right aileron and full right rudder, and the airplane touched down on the centerline. After parking, an inspection of the left wingtip fuel tank revealed scraping and flattening of about the aft third of the underside of the fuel tank. The upper surface of the wing, inboard from the tip tank, was wrinkled. The automated weather observing system (AWOS) was reporting, in part:  Wind, 270 degrees at 5 knots; visibility, 9 statute miles; clouds and sky condition, 1,200 feet overcast. The FAA Facility Directory/Alaska Supplement notes that ""Because of natural obstructions, the AWOS-3 wind may be unrepresentative of runway wind conditions."" The captain indicated that the landing approach speed was flown with additional airspeed to compensate for the wind conditions, and he noted that he could only assume that windshear contributed to the accident. Probable Cause: The captain's inadequate compensation for wind conditions during the landing flare/touchdown. Contributing to the accident were a crosswind and windshear.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ANC08LA035 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB ANC08LA035  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates03-Oct-2022 08:21 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

All 46 on board were killed. MÃ©rida Airport is located in a mountain valley at an elevation of 5010 feet. Terrain in the valley rises from 1000 to 19.500 feet. Arrivals and departures have to use the Rio Chama corridor to the west of the airport. Runway 07 is used for landings and takeoffs have to be performed in the opposite direction, from runway 25.  Santa BÃ¡rbara Airlines however used an unpublished approach and departure procedure which let the aircraft use a valley to the northeast of the airport. This procedure saved about 15 minutes of flying time on the route to Caracas. After all passengers had boarded for flight 518 to Caracas, it took about 30 minutes for the pilots to arrive at the aircraft. Being late, they immediately started the engines while simultaneously asking for permission to do so. Because an Avior Airlines flight was approaching the airport, the crew were told to expedite their departure or wait for the arrival of the Avior aircraft. The flight crew decided to go and began taxiing 2 minutes and 40 seconds after startup. Consequently the AHRS (attitude and heading reference) system of the airplane was unusable. The aircraft needed to remain still for 3 minutes after the battery is turned on so that all gyroscopes, accelerometers and magnetometers can be stabilized and synchronized. The AHRS provides attitude information for aircraft, including roll, pitch and yaw. The captain possibly expected to re-initialize the system while they were at cruising altitude. After departure from runway 25 the crew planned to use the unpublished procedure. Climbing through clouds a 180-degree turn was initiated. Using the unreliable magnetic compass, the flight made a 270 degree turn, heading towards rising terrain. The captain took over control from the copilot. When visual contact with terrain was regained, the crew noted they were heading for mountains. The captain tried to avoid rising terrain but the aircraft impacted the side of a mountain at 3810 m. CONCLUSIONS The attitude and heading reference system (AHRS) as a device was operational, however the initialization of the system was incomplete, so the standard mode was in a fault condition. This failure mode left the RMI or radio magnetic indicators and the autopilot inoperative.  The EGPWS or enhanced ground proximity warning system was inoperative in the ""enhanced"" functions, since the information is displayed on the EFIS system screens, therefore there was no early warning (Visual) of impact against the mountain range. The GPS was the only instrument capable of providing heading information to within one degree of accuracy. Because it is located on the co-pilot's lower left panel, the information provided by the co-pilot was basically available for co-pilot observation. In addition, the size of the display is relatively small for the information it shows. The crew was valid, qualified and certified by the National Institute of Civil Aeronautics (INAC). However, the crew was very unconcerned to learn that they were taking off with the AHRS system inoperative and the weather conditions were instrument or IMC. The meteorological station in Merida was inoperative. The control tower did not have an operational communications recording system. According to the deformation shown on the low pressure compressor wheels, the engines had power at the time of impact.METAR: 21:00 UTC / 17:00 local time: SVMD 212100Z 29008KT 9999 SCT013 BKN100 XX/XX Q1018=22:00 UTC / 18:00 local time: SVMD 212200Z 25005KT 9999 BKN013 OVC100 20/12 Q1021=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JIAAC Venezuela Report number: 11-013/2008 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: LAGAD Aviation  NotiSAR  Instituto Nacional de AeronÃ¡utica Civil (INAC) History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  4 April 1993 N422MQ Simmons Airlines Chicago, IL min Location  Images: photo (c) Google Earth; MÃ©rida-A Carnevalli Airport (MRD/SVMD) photo (c) Ulrich F.

The airplane was registered to the Southwest Orthopedic and Sports Medicine Clinic and operated by Interstate Helicopters. At the time of the accident, Interstate Helicopters was operating the accident airplane in commercial service contrary to its Federal Aviation Administration-issued 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135 operating certificate, which, at the time, did not authorize operation of the accident airplane or any other fixed-wing aircraft. The Cessna Citation took off from Wiley Post Airport, OK at 15:13 and climbed to an altitude of 3,100 feet while on a southwesterly heading. While in the airspace near the Lake Overholser dam the airplane started a steep descent. The airplane impacted wooded terrain approximately one mile south of the dam. There were no reported radio calls of distress from the flight crew. Investigation revealed that departure from controlled flight likely resulted from wing structure damage sustained during an in-flight collision with a flock of American white pelicans, which far exceeded the airframeÂs design certification limit. Also, the right engine failed as a result of the collision with these birds.

There were seven people on board; two pilots, two engineers, and three flight officers. The pilots reported that the approach and landing were normal. However, both Beta lights did not illuminate during the landing roll, so they could not use reverse thrust. The crew used maximum brakes to slow the aircraft, and rolled through to the end of runway 15. During the 180-degree right turn at the end of the runway, they felt the left brakes grabbing, and had to use increased thrust on the left engine to assist the turn. After completing the turn, the pilots backtracked the aircraft towards taxiway E, about 450 meters from the departure end of runway 15. The air traffic controller informed the Transall crew that heavy smoke was coming from the left main wheels, and that they should proceed to taxiway E and stop on the taxiway. Before the aircraft entered taxiway E, the controller activated the crash alarm. The pilots stopped the aircraft on taxiway E, and the occupants disembarked and attempted to extinguish the wheel-bay fire with a hand held extinguisher. The airport rescue fire fighting service (RFFS) arrived at the aircraft 10 minutes after the aircraft came to a stop on taxiway E. It took a further 5 minutes to commence applying foam. The attempts to extinguish the fire were unsuccessful, and the fire destroyed the aircraft and its cargo of fuel in drums. CAUSES: ""The aircraft's left main wheels' brakes overheated during the landing roll and a fire commenced in the brake assembly of one or more of the left main landing gear wheels.  The evidence indicated that a brake cylinder and/or hydraulic line may have failed. It is likely that brake system hydraulic fluid under pressure, was the propellant that fed the fire.  There was no Emergency Response Plan at Wamena.

Touch-down was normal and about halfway during the landing roll the pilot felt the left side of the aircraft is slowly sinking. The left-hand propeller then struck the runway surface.

The first officer looked up and they were headed toward an unoccupied parked airplane on the opposite side of the taxiway. At that time they struck the parked airplane. According to both crew members with the direction of the wind, nose steering alone was not enough to turn the airplane onto the taxiway.

The airplane operated on AdamAir flight KI292 from Jakarta.  Prior to descent, the flight crew received weather information indicating that the weather at their destination, Batam Airport, was fine. At 03:02 UTC the flight crew contacted the Batam Tower controller and were informed that the visibility was 1,000 meters and they were sequence number three for landing runway 04. The controller subsequently informed flight 292 that a preceding aircraft had the runway in sight at an altitude of about 500 feet and reported that the wind was 360 degrees at 8 knots with heavy rain.  The flight crew configured the aircraft for landing, using flaps 40 degrees. The flight crew were able to see the runway prior to the Decision Altitude (DA), however the PIC was convinced that continuing the approach to landing was unsafe and elected to go around. At 03:19 UTC, flight 292 was again established on the localizer runway 04, and the Tower controller informed them that the visibility had improved to 2,000 meters. While on final approach, the flight crew reported that the runway was in sight and they received landing clearance. During the landing roll, as the groundspeed decreased below 30 knots, the aircraft yawed to the right. The flight crew attempted to steer the aircraft back to centerline by applying full left rudder. The aircraft continued yaw to the right and came to stop on the runway shoulder at approximately 40 meters from the right side of the runway edge, and 2,760 meters from the runway 04 threshold. No one was injured in this accident. The aircraft was seriously damaged with the right main landing gear assembly detached and collapsing backward and damaging the right wing and flaps.

It was expected to arrive at Bebi Airstrip at approximately 09:21. The aircraft contacted Enugu ATC at 08:56 while descending to FL110. The crew were cleared to descend further down to 5000 feet. It did not arrive at Bebi Airstrip and was declared missing.  On August 30, 2008, hunters found the wreckage in thick rain forest in Obanliku local government area. Investigation revealed that the Enugu tower controller issued descent instructions to 5, 000 feet AMSL (FL50) outside its control airspace not considering that the aircraft was not flying the filed flight plan route and the minimum safe altitude (MSA) of the area reported by Jeppesen charts as 11,200 feet. Causal Factor: I. The flight crew conducted an approach into a VFR airfield in an instrument meteorological condition and did not maintain terrain clearance and minimum safe altitude which led to Controlled Flight Into Terrain. II. The crew did not respond promptly to GPWS warning. Contributory Factors 1. The flight crew was not familiar with the route in a situation of low clouds, poor visibility and mountainous terrain. 2. The Area Controllers did not detect the estimate as passed by the pilot for positions not in the filed flight plan (LIPAR and LUNDO) and omitting ENUGU. 3. The erroneous co-location of Bebi airstrip and Obudu on the NAMA Chart confused the crew.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIB Nigeria Report number: WINGS/2008/03/15/F Status: Investigation completedDuration: 7 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   Obudu-bound plane missing (Daily Trust, 16-3-2008)  Search for missing airplane moves to Cameroon, 4 days after (Daily Sun, 19-3-2008)  How 'missing' plane was flown out of Nigeria - The Obasanjo connection (Nigerian Tribune, 28-4-2008)   Location  Images: photo (c) Accident Investigation Bureau Nigeria; near Bushi Village, Obanliku; September 2008 photo (c) Accident Investigation Bureau Nigeria; near Bushi Village, Obanliku; September 2008 photo (c) Accident Investigation Bureau Nigeria; near Bushi Village, Obanliku; September 2008 photo (c) Accident Investigation Bureau Nigeria; near Bushi Village, Obanliku; September 2008 photo (c) Accident Investigation Bureau Nigeria; near Bushi Village, Obanliku; September 2008 photo (c) Accident Investigation Bureau Nigeria; near Bushi Village, Obanliku; September 2008 photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Puerto Plata-Gregorio LuperÃ³n International Airport (POP/MDPP); January 2000 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were no injuries among the 24 passengers and three crew members. Cirrus Airlines Flight 1567 departed Berlin-Tempelhof Airport (THF) at 16:30 on a domestic service to Mannheim Airport (MHG). The copilot was Pilot Flying (PF). During the flight the copilot commented that he had difficulties in landing at Mannheim. The captain replied that he did fine. At 17:36 the flight was cleared for a LOC/DME approach to runway 27. One minute later the flight reached the prescribed altitude of 5000 feet. The descent was continued until the PF noticed his error. The captain instructed the PF to arrest the descent and climb back towards 5000 feet. By then the flight had descended to 3800 feet, 100 feet below the Minimum Sector Altitude (MSA). After reaching the Final Approach Fix at 5000 feet, the crew reported that they were established on the localizer. Langen Radar instructed the flight to contact Mannheim Tower.  The airplane was configured for the final approach and landing, with the captain telling the PF not to worry several times. The PF attempted to flare the airplane for landing, but the aircraft floated over the runway without touching down. The PF then stated: ""Oh - your control"". The captain took over control and replied ""My control"". At that moment the airplane was 200 m past the runway threshold. Touchdown was accomplished at 530 m, with 480 m of runway remaining. The airplane failed to decelerate as expected and the captain called for manual braking action. The airplane overran the runway end at a speed of 50 knots. The left hand main gear collapsed as it hit a pothole. The aircraft then slid into an earthen wall and came to rest. There was no fire. Overran runway on landing and hit an earthen wall. One wing and engine severely damaged. CAUSES: The accident happened because: - The aircraft overran the end of the runway and collided with an embankment, - No go-around (balked landing) was initiated, - The throttle, after placement by the PIC (PF), could not be moved into ""ground idle"" or reverse, - The landing was not aborted after the plane had flown over the touchdown zone, - During the flare for landing the throttles of the engines were not selected to ""Flight Idle"", which was not noted by both pilots, - The flight crew flew the approach not in accordance with SOPs, and thereby pushing and even exceeding the limits. The following factors contributed to the accident: - Many non-precision approaches and landings at Mannheim City were not performed according to air carriers OMs, - The TRs and FOIs of the aircraft manufacturer were not incorporated into the OM/B and D of the air carrier, - The practical training of the flight crew by the air carrier was inadequate in terms of preventing an erroneous operation of the throttle control on the basis of the manufacturer of the Do 328-100 issued instructions, - The flight crew conducted a non-precision approach, which did not meet the procedural requirements of the OM of the air carrier and the AIP, - The design of the power lever was not forgiving enough, - The risks of existing problems in the operation of the power levers were not correctly identified and eliminated by by the relevant authorities and the relevant type certificate holder, in spite of several relevant events and various safety recommendations, - The touchdown zone in Mannheim was not marked, - The size and design of the safety area at the end of runway 27 was not sufficient to guarantee the operation of the flight within the safety levels set by ICAO and the legislator.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BFU Report number: BFU 1X001-08 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   Cirrus Airlines press release 19.03.2008   Location  Images: photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; MÃ¼nchen-Franz Josef Strauss Airport (MUC/EDDM); February 2007 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight from Madinah and the landing at Dhaka was uneventful. During the landing roll, approximately 50 seconds after touchdown, the flight crew received a call from the tower controller where the tower controller inquired whether the aircraft was under control. The flight crew responded to the call by stating that the aircraft was completely under control and asked what the problem seemed to be. The controller then informed the flight crew that fire was observed at the right wing area. At this point the Aerodrome Fire Operator had already activated the fire fighters as well as the rescue team. As soon as the controller had informed the flight crew about the fire, the flight crew received a No. 3 engine fire alarm. The co-pilot immediately discharged the first engine fire bottle and the flight crew requested fire fighter assistance and shut down all engines. The co-pilot waited 20 seconds until the second fire bottle was discharged. At this time the commander called the senior cabin attendant to the flight deck using the public address system (PA). This command was followed by a command to the cabin crew to remain seated. The commander informed the senior cabin attendant of the situation and instructed him to evaluate the situation and to evacuate the passengers if necessary. The senior cabin attendant went back down to the main deck and saw the smoke and the fire through the windows. He then commanded the cabin crew as well as passengers, by using a megaphone, to evacuate the aircraft. The cabin attendant at location L2 had already operated the emergency exit and started evacuating the passengers. Cabin attendants at locations L1 and R2 also operated their respective emergency exits. After realizing that smoke and fire were at the right hand side, the emergency exit at R2 was blocked by one of the cabin attendants. All passengers managed to evacuate without serious injuries and the fire department at Zia International Airport managed to extinguish the fire successfully. The damage to the aircraft was later evaluated as beyond economical repair. Findings as to causes and contributing factors - Incorrect assembly of the flexible half coupling at the front spar of engine No. 3. - Retaining ring missing in flexible half coupling at the front spar engine No. 3. - Lock wire fastened in such a way that the coupling nut might rotate slightly.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: RNF Report number: M-01508/AIG-04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) Harro Ranter; ZÃ¼rich-Kloten Airport (ZRH/LSZH); 30 August 1996 photo (c) Dale Coleman; Manchester Airport (MAN/EGCC); 08 May 2005 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The commander called for start at 14:17 and, at 14:20, was cleared to taxi to holding point A1 for a departure from runway 21. At 14:24, ATC instructed the crew to hold at A1 and cleared them for a LYDD 2 departure. At 14:34, one minute after becoming airborne, the co-pilot transmitted: ""And victor papa bravo golf echo er weÂre making an immediate turn to return to the airport immediate turn to the airport."" The tower controller replied: ""Victor golf echo join downwind right-hand runway two one, the biggin qnh one thousand, threshold elevationÂs five one seven feet, whatÂs the nature of your problem?"" The co-pilot replied: ""ere we donÂt know sir weÂre getting er engine vibration weÂll come straight back."" The aircraft then manoeuvred to overhead the airfield at approximately 1,200 ft aal heading towards the end of the downwind leg for a left-hand circuit to runway 21. As the aircraft left the overhead it commenced a continuous descent and, at 13:36 hrs, the co-pilot transmitted: ""And er victor golf echo we have major problem a major power problem it looks as though weÂre er going in weÂre going in!"" The aircraft flew extremely low over the roofs of several houses before its left wing impacted the roof of a house at the end of a residential close adjacent to a small wood. After the initial impact the aircraft struck the ground and caught fire destroying the attached garage of a neighbouring dwelling. Examination of the wreckage, however, did not reveal any evidence of pre-impact restrictions in the flight control circuits and examination of the engines, after disassembly, revealed no evidence of either engine having suffered a bird strike or foreign object damage. Furthermore, no pre-impact damage or failures were found in any of the rotating assemblies or main bearings. CONTRIBUTORY FACTORS: 1. It is probable that a mechanical failure within the air cycle machine caused the vibration which led to the crew attempting to return to the departure airfield. 2. A missing rivet head on the left engine fuel shut-off lever may have led to an inadvertent shut-down of that engine. 3. Approximately 70 seconds prior to impact neither engine was producing any thrust. 4. A relight attempt on the second engine was probably started before the relit first engine had reached idle speed, resulting in insufficient time for enough thrust to be developed to arrest the aircraftÂs rate of descent before ground impact.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: AAR 3/2010 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   AAIB Special Bulletin S2/2008  BBC News   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The copilot (CP) was flying and air traffic control (ATC) was vectoring the airplane for an approach to a 10,000-foot long, 150-foot-wide runway, when an amber abnormal indicator light illuminated on the engine indicating and crew alert system (EICAS), indicating the hydraulic fluid on system A was low. The pilot-in-command (PIC) and the CP completed the checklist procedures down to the blow down of the landing gear. The flight crew did not follow the checklist sequence, and they did not evaluate the hydraulic pump to see if the hydraulic pump pressure could be restored. The flight crew turned on the A side pump, the power transfer unit was engaged, and the landing gear was lowered. The flight crew did not inform ATC of the loss of hydraulic fluid. The airplane touched down on the first 1,000 feet of runway 13L, and the CP informed the PIC that the brakes were not working. The PIC activated the emergency brakes one time, which appeared to work. The CP did not report any problems with nose wheel steering. The CP applied reverse thrust and the arm extend light illuminated on the right thrust reverser. The airplane started veering to the right and the CP could not maintain directional control. The PIC continued pulling the emergency brake handle as the airplane went off the right side of the runway, sheared off the left main landing gear, and came to a complete stop. Download of the EICAS system revealed the CP did not take the right thrust reverser out of reverse thrust. Review of airplane logbooks revealed the left hydraulic reservoir installed in the airplane was a repaired unit. The unit had been removed from another airplane due to an EICAS message stating it was empty when it was full. The switch was found to be out of adjustment. The unit was inspected and no anomalies were noted. Probable Cause: The co-pilot's failure to maintain directional control during the landing roll. Contributing to the accident was a loss of system A hydraulic fluid for undetermined reasons and the flight crew's failure to follow the checklist sequence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

On takeoff, the crew was given a clearance to a 150-degree heading and a climb to 10,000 feet mean sea level (msl).  The takeoff was normal and in accordance with company procedures.  Approximately 2 minutes after takeoff and passing through 8,000 feet msl and 230 knots, the crew noticed ""large white birds.""  Immediately thereafter, the airplane impacted the birds.  ""At first there was a loud bang, followed by a moderately loud wind noise.""  The crew realized at least one bird had penetrated into the cockpit; they declared an emergency and requested to return to the airport.  After verifying aircraft control, the crew maneuvered back to the airport.  The airplane landed uneventfully and taxied to a ramp.  Examination of the airframe revealed a hole in the aircraft's forward fuselage below the cockpit windows.  The fuselage skin and forward pressure bulkhead were penetrated and contained bird matter.  Bird matter was noted on the cockpit windows, fuselage, vertical and horizontal stabilizers, and in the left engine.  The left engine fan blades were damaged and the spinner was buckled and collapsed.

It became airborne at 23:23 and shortly afterwards the pilot had been instructed to transfer to the departures controllerÂs radio frequency.  On first radio contact with that controller, the pilot was advised that the aircraft was identified on radar. At 23:25:30, the controller instructed the pilot to turn left onto a heading of 090 degrees, which was acknowledged. Instead of the expected left turn, the radar returns indicated that the aircraft was turning right, towards the south-west. At 23:25:54, the controller confirmed with the pilot that he was to turn left and at 23:25:59 the pilot once again acknowledged the left turn and added ""IÂve got a slight technical fault here"". No further transmissions were received from the pilot. The radar returns over the next 70 seconds showed the aircraft completed a left turn followed by a right turn before disappearing from radar. The Metro crashed into the sea.  On 12 May 2008, a significant wreckage field was identified. That wreckage was spread over an area approximately 1,200 m long and 400 m wide. CONTRIBUTING SAFETY FACTORS: - It was very likely that the aircraftÂs alternating current electrical power system was not energised at any time during the flight. - It was very likely that the aircraft became airborne without a functioning primary attitude reference or autopilot that, combined with the added workload of managing the Âslight technical faultÂ, led to pilot spatial disorientation and subsequent loss of control. OTHER SAFETY FACTORS: - The pilotÂs Metro III endorsement training was not conducted in accordance with the operatorÂs approved training and checking manual, with the result that the pilotÂs competence and ultimately, safety of the operation could not be assured. [Significant safety issue] - The chief pilot was performing the duties and responsibilities of several key positions in the operatorÂs organisational structure, increasing the risk of omissions in the operatorÂs training and checking requirements. - The conduct of the flight single-pilot increased the risk of errors of omission, such as not turning on or noticing the failure of aircraft items and systems, or complying with directions.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ATSB Report number: AO-2008-026 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: ATSB AO-2008-026   Location  Images: photo (c) ATSB; Sydney-Kingsford Smith International Airport, NSW (SYD); 09 April 2008 photo (c) ATSB; off Sydney-Kingsford Smith International Airport, NSW (SYD) photo (c) ATSB; off Sydney-Kingsford Smith International Airport, NSW (SYD) photo (c) ATSB photo (c) ATSB photo (c) ATSB photo (c) ATSB photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Sydney-Kingsford Smith International Airport, NSW (SYD/YSSY); April 2000 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were no unsafe landing gear configuration warnings prior to touchdown. Extensive testing of the airplane's hydraulic and electrical systems did not reveal any malfunctions that would have resulted in the accident sequence. The landing gear and speedbrake systems were independent; however, wiring from both systems were located on five sets of common connectors. Examination of the wires and connector pins within wiring bundles common to the speedbrake and landing gear system did not reveal any evidence of electrical faults; however, an electrical short could have existed at the time of the accident which would have resulted in a spurious retract signal and would not have been evident in subsequent testing.

The commercial pilot and three passengers were not injured. The personal flight departed from Lincoln Regional Airport, California, about 08:54, with a planned destination of Carlsbad. At the time of the accident, the pilot had canceled his instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan, and was executing a visual flight rules (VFR) approach to runway 24 in visual meteorological conditions.  As the airplane approached the destination airport, the pilot selected vertical speed mode on the autopilot. While descending, the copilot's Primary Flight Display (PFD) began to flicker. About 5 minutes later, as the airplane transitioned through 28,000 feet mean sea level, the left PFD flashed a ""PFT"" alert indicating that the autopilot had disconnected. The pilot said he immediately felt heavy control forces on the control yoke that he had to exert to fly the airplane. Shortly thereafter, the pilot discovered that the electric pitch trim was not operational. While hand-flying the airplane the pilot entered instrument meteorological conditions as the airplane descended through a 2,400-foot-thick cloud layer. Thereafter, the pilot continued a visual approach to the 4,897-foot-long runway. The pilot noted that he was overwhelmed with the electrical failures and fatigued from maneuvering the airplane by hand for such a long duration (which he approximated was around 45 minutes). The airplane crossed the runway threshold about 15 knots faster than the correct landing speed and the airplane touched down past the midpoint of the runway. The pilot realized that despite his braking attempts the airplane was going to continue off the runway surface over a small downsloping cliff at the end. He determined that he would not be able to abort the landing due to the airplane's diminished ground speed and elected to perform a 180-degree turn. The airplane ground looped, coming to rest in a dirt area south of the runway; the main landing gear collapsed and the flaps folded under the wings. According to the pilot, he never attempted to reset the autopilot system. The autopilot was designed for an automatic disengagement when there is a system failure, invalid sensor data, or yaw damper failure. On the manufacturer's current Pilots' Abbreviated Checklist, Emergency Procedures section, it states that if the autopilot preflight test fail warning (red ""PFT"" warning on the PFD) illuminates, the pilot should reset the associated circuit breaker to clear the fault. A post-accident examination of the airplane's systems revealed no mechanical malfunctions or failures, with the exception of a flickering PFD screen. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The pilot's misjudgment of speed and distance, resulting in an overshoot of the runway. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's failure to follow the Autopilot Preflight Test Fail checklist and his distraction with a flickering primary flight display screen.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: LAX08FA117 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.
