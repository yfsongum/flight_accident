The positioning flight was conducted using instrument flight rules and had departed Scottsdale Airport, AZ (SDL) at 15:03 MST. The pilot occupying the left seat was not injured and the pilot occupying the right seat received minor injuries.  In a statement to the NTSB provided by the Pilot-In-Command, upon arrival to TEX the weather was reported to be below minimums; the crew elected to hold over the Cones VOR and wait to see if weather conditions would improve. The crew was given instructions, by air traffic control, to hold as published and to expect further clearance (EFC) at 16:30. When the weather improved to a visibility of 4 miles and a ceiling of 2300 feet, the PIC requested a descent and approach to KTEX. At approximately 4 miles from the airport, the pilot acquired the airport environment but was not in position to land, so he called for a missed approach back to Cones VOR. The pilot then requested a second attempt to land stating that ""if we did not land, we would like to be sequenced to into KMTJ"" Montrose Regional Airport Montrose, CO, their alternate airport. On the second approach, both crew members stated that they had acquired the runway environment; however, they were still too high for a visual approach. The crew elected to do a 360-degree, right, descending turn, in order to get in a better position for landing. On completion of the turn, they again affirmed the runway environment and that they were aligned with the extended centerline of the runway. The airplane touched down and after full thrust reversers were deployed, the nose gear collapsed. The airplane began to slide in snow and came to a stop about mid-field, in an upright position. An initial FAA examination of the area indicated that the airplane had touched down about 20-feet to the right, of the runway. Additionally, the airplane's wings were torn from the fuselage and the tail section had separated just aft of the engines, during the contact with the ground. Weather reported at KTEX 10 minutes prior to the accident was winds 260 degrees at 8 knots, visibility of 3 miles, scattered clouds at 400 feet, broken clouds at 2300 feet, temperature of 6 degrees Celsius, dew point of 6 degrees Celsius, and altimeter setting 29.85 inches of mercury.

The flight was en route to Charlotte Douglas International Airport (CLT), North Carolina, USA, and departed LaGuardia runway 04 at 15:24. At this time, the first officer was the pilot flying (PF), and the captain was the pilot monitoring (PM). The takeoff and initial portion of the climb were uneventful. At 15:25:45, the LaGuardia ATCT local controller instructed the flight crew to contact the New York Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) LGA departure controller. The captain contacted the departure controller at 15:25:51, advising him that the airplane was at 700 feet and climbing to 5,000 feet. The controller then instructed the flight to climb to and maintain 15,000 feet, and the captain acknowledged the instruction.  At 15:27:10, the captain stated, ""birds."" One second later, at an altitude of 2,818 feet above ground level, the crew heard thumps and thuds followed by a shuddering sound. The aircraft had struck several Canada geese. Immediately after the bird encounter, both engines' fan and core (N1 and N2, respectively) speeds started to decelerate.  At 15:27:14, the first officer stated, ""uh oh,"" followed by the captain stating, ""we got one rol- both of 'em rolling back.""  The captain then stated he would start the APU and took over control of the airplane. At 15:27:28, the captain instructed the first officer to ""get the QRH [quick reference handbook] loss of thrust on both engines"", and reported the emergency situation to the LGA departure controller, stating, ""mayday mayday maydayÂthis is...Cactus fifteen thirty nine hit birds, we've lost thrust in both engines, we're turning back towards LaGuardia."" The LGA departure controller acknowledged the captain's statement and then instructed him to turn left heading 220Â°. The first officer began conducting Part 1 of the QRH ENG DUAL FAILURE checklist (Engine Dual Failure checklist), stating, ""if fuel remaining, engine mode selector, ignition,"" and the captain responded, ""ignition."" The first officer then stated, ""thrust levers confirm idle,"" and the captain responded, ""idle."" About 4 seconds later, the first officer stated, ""airspeed optimum relight. three hundred knots. we don't have that,"" and the captain responded, ""we don't."" At 15:28:05, the LGA departure controller asked the captain if he wanted to try to land on runway 13 at LGA if it was available, and the captain responded, ""we're unable. we may end up in the Hudson [River].""  The LGA departure controller cleared the flight for a left-hand traffic pattern for runway 31, but the captain responded, ""unable."" The controller then stated that runway 4 at LGA was available, and the captain responded, ""I'm not sure we can make any runway. Uh what's over to our right anything in New Jersey maybe Teterboro?"" The controller replied, ""ok yeah, off your right side is Teterboro Airport [TEB]."" Subsequently, the departure controller asked the captain if he wanted to try going to TEB, and the captain replied, ""yes."" At 15:29:11, the captain announced on the public address (PA) system, ""this is the Captain, brace for impact."" Meanwhile the pilots were working the checklist to restart the engines.  At 15:29:21, the LGA departure controller instructed the captain to turn right 280Â° for runway 1 at TEB. But the captain responded: ""we can't do it.""  The departure controller then asked the captain which runway at TEB he would like, and the captain responded, ""we're gonna be in the Hudson."" When it became clear that the engines would not restart, the captain requested to first officer to select the flaps.  At 15:30:43, the aircraft landed on the surface of the Hudson River. Within seconds after the ditching, the crewmembers and passengers initiated evacuation of the airplane. Subsequently, all of the occupants were evacuated from the airplane and rescued by area responders. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The ingestion of large birds into each engine, which resulted in an almost total loss of thrust in both engines and the subsequent ditching on the Hudson River. Contributing to the fuselage damage and resulting unavailability of the aft slide/rafts were (1) the Federal Aviation AdministrationÂs approval of ditching certification without determining whether pilots could attain the ditching parameters without engine thrust, (2) the lack of industry flight crew training and guidance on ditching techniques, and (3) the captainÂs resulting difficulty maintaining his intended airspeed on final approach due to the task saturation resulting from the emergency situation. Contributing to the survivability of the accident was (1) the decision-making of the flight crewmembers and their crew resource management during the accident sequence; (2) the fortuitous use of an airplane that was equipped for an extended overwater flight, including the availability of the forward slide/rafts, even though it was not required to be so equipped; (3) the performance of the cabin crewmembers while expediting the evacuation of the airplane; and (4) the proximity of the emergency responders to the accident site and their immediate and appropriate response to the accident.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NTSB/AAR-10/03 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   NTSB  Canada geese caused plane to ditch in Hudson (Sunday Independent, 18-1-2009)   Location  Images: photo (c) Janis Krums; Hudson River; 15 January 2009; (CC:by) photo (c) bmunch was bunglemunch; Hudson River; 16 January 2009; (CC:by-nc-sa) photo (c) bmunch was bunglemunch; Hudson River; 16 January 2009; (CC:by-nc-sa) photo (c) David Daoust; Jersey City, New Jersey; 17 January 2009; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) David Daoust; Jersey City, New Jersey; 17 January 2009; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) David Daoust; Jersey City, New Jersey; 17 January 2009; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) David Daoust; Jersey City, New Jersey; 18 January 2009; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) David Daoust; Jersey City, New Jersey; 18 January 2009; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) Joseph Hoetzl; Jersey City, New Jersey; 25 January 2009; (CC:by-nc) photo (c) EeSLee; Jersey City, New Jersey; 31 January 2009; (CC:by) photo (c) www.quintanomedia.com; Little Ferry, New Jersey; 31 January 2009; (CC:by) photo (c) NTSB; Jersey City, New Jersey; 18 January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Jersey City, New Jersey; January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Jersey City, New Jersey; January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Jersey City, New Jersey; January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Jersey City, New Jersey; January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Jersey City, New Jersey; January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Jersey City, New Jersey; January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Jersey City, New Jersey; January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Jersey City, New Jersey; January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Jersey City, New Jersey; January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Miami International Airport, FL (MIA/KMIA); March 2001 photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Phoenix-Sky Harbor International Airport, AZ (PHX/KPHX); October 2006 photo (c) Sergio Cardona; New York-La Guardia Airport, NY (LGA/KLGA); 13 January 2009 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates19-Feb-2024 18:44 ASN Updated [Damage, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

During the missed approach, the aircraft struck a tree. The crew continued the missed approach and returned for a landing at Island Lake without further incident. No injuries were reported. The aircraft sustained damage to the wing leading edge and underside, and to its landing gear doors. FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1. The crew conducted an Area Navigation (RNAV) approach for which they were not trained, with an aircraft that was not properly equipped nor approved for such purpose. 2. The aircraft descended 300 feet below the minimum descent altitude (MDA) as a result of a number of lapses, errors and adaptations which, when combined, resulted in the mismanaged approach. 3. The aural warning on the aircraft's altitude alerter had been silenced prior to the approach, which precluded it from alerting the crew when the aircraft descended below minimum descent altitude. 4. The SkyNorth standard operating procedures for conducting a non-precision approach were not followed, which resulted in the aircraft descending below the minimum descent altitude.

Weather at Lubbock was poor with an overcast at 500 feet, freezing drizzle and mist. The aircraft encountered icing conditions while en route to Lubbock. And although the airplane accumulated some ice during the flight that degraded its performance, the NTSB determined that the aircraft could have landed safely had the airspeed been maintained.  During the approach to Lubbock runway 17R, at about 1400 feet above the ground and about 90 seconds from the runway, the captain indicated a flight control problem saying, ""We have no flaps."" Although the crewmembers had been trained to perform a go-around and refer to a checklist if a flap problem occurred during an approach, the captain chose to continue the approach as he attempted to troubleshoot the flap anomaly while the first officer flew the plane. Neither flight crewmember adequately monitored the airspeed, which decayed to the extent that the stick shaker activated, which warned of an impending aerodynamic stall.  The captain continued the unstabilized approach even though he received additional stick shaker activations and an aural ""pull up"" warning from the terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS). At that point, the plane was descending at a rate of over 2,000 ft per minute.  Although procedures for responding to either the stick shaker or the TAWS warning require the immediate application of maximum engine power, the captain did not apply maximum power until 17 seconds after the TAWS warning. Seconds after maximum power was applied, the airplane entered an aerodynamic stall and crashed. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the flight crew's failure to monitor and maintain a minimum safe airspeed while executing an instrument approach in icing conditions, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall at low altitude. Contributing to the accident were 1) the flight crew's failure to follow published standard operating procedures in response to a flap anomaly, 2) the captain's decision to continue with the unstabilized approach, 3) the flight crew's poor crew resource management, and 4) fatigue due to the time of day in which the accident occurred and a cumulative sleep debt, which likely impaired the captain's performance.""METAR: 09:53 UTC / 03:53 local time: KLBB 270953Z 01014KT 3SM -FZDZ BR OVC005 M08/M09 A3013 RMK AO2 PRESRR SLP227 P0000 T10781094=wind at 10 degrees, 14 kts, visibility 3 miles in mist and freezing drizzle, ceiling 500 feet overcast, temperature -7.8 deg C, dewpoint -9.4 deg C10:53 UTC / 04:53 local time: KLBB 271053Z 02011G18KT 2SM -FZDZ BR OVC005 M08/M09 A3013 RMK AO2 CIG 004V009 SLP228 P0000 T10781094=wind at 20 degrees, 11 kts gusting to 18 kts, visibility 2 miles in mist and freezing drizzle, ceiling 500 feet overcast, temperature -7.8 deg C, dewpoint -9.4 deg CAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NTSB/AAR-11-02 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   NTSB History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  21 January 1998 N15827 Continental Express 0 Hartford-Bradley International Airport, CT (BDL) sub Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport, TX (LBB/KLBB); January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport, TX (LBB/KLBB); January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport, TX (LBB/KLBB); January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport, TX (LBB/KLBB); January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport, TX (LBB/KLBB); January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport, TX (LBB/KLBB); January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Houston-Intercontinental Airport, TX (IAH/KIAH); February 1993 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The plane was given priority and it landed at 17.29. The plane was taken to an isolated area of the Delhi Airport and was cordoned off by the National Security Guard (NSG) and Central Industrial Security Force (CISF). One man on board the flight was prevented by a cabin crew from changing seat when the aircraft was descending for landing. He then claimed he had a gun and an infectious needle, police said, adding he also threatened the cabin crew by claiming he was also involved in the Indian Airlines flight 814 hijacking case of 1999, which forced them to inform the pilot, who gave a distress call for emergency landing.

After the nose ski cleared the snow, the left wing rose and the aircraft veered to the right and the captain, who was the pilot flying, continued the takeoff. The right ski, however, was still in contact with the snow. The aircraft became airborne briefly as it cleared a deep gully to the right of the runway. The aircraft remained in a steep right bank and the right wing contacted the snow-covered ground. The aircraft flew through a chain link fence and crashed into trees surrounding the airport. The five passengers and two crewmembers evacuated the aircraft with minor injuries. There was a small fire near the right engine exhaust that was immediately extinguished by the crew. FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1. Contamination on the wings of the aircraft was not fully removed before take-off. It is likely that asymmetric contamination of the wings created a lift differential and a loss of lateral control. 2. Although the operator was not authorized for short take-off and landing (STOL) take-off on this aircraft, the crew conducted a STOL take-off, which reduced the aircraft's safety margin relative to its stalling speed and minimum control speed. 3. As a result of the loss of lateral control, the slow STOL take-off speed, and the manipulation of the flaps, the aircraft did not remain airborne and veered right, colliding with obstacles beside the ski strip. FINDINGS AS TO RISK 1. The out of phase task requirements regarding the engine vibration isolator assembly, as listed in the operator's maintenance schedule approval, results in a less than thorough inspection requirement, increasing the likelihood of fatigue cracks remaining undetected. 2. The right engine inboard and top engine mounts had pre-existing fatigue cracks, increasing the risk of catastrophic failure. OTHER FINDINGS 1. The cockpit voice recorder (CVR) contained audio of a previous flight and was not in operation during the occurrence flight. Minimum equipment list (MEL) procedures for logbook entries and placarding were not followed. 2. The Transwest Air Limited safety management system (SMS) did not identify deviations from standard operating procedures.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A09C0017 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources: CADORS Number: 2009C0305 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  19 November 1969 VH-TGS TAA-Trans Australia Airlines 0 Marawaka sub 5 March 2006 C-FCCE Transwest Air 0 La Ronge Airport (CYVC), SK sub Location  Images: photo (c) TSB; La Ronge Airport, SK (YVC/CYVC); 04 February 2009 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The certified flight instructor (CFI) and the student pilot were not injured; the airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and wings from impact forces. The student pilot was performing the takeoff. During the takeoff roll on runway 30, the airplane began to drift to the right, and the student applied left rudder to correct for the drift. The CFI advanced the right throttle during the ground roll in an attempt to counteract the right yaw. The tail wheel came off the ground about 80 knots, and the airplane swerved to the right. The CFI applied left rudder in an attempt to stop the yaw and drift. As the airplane was about to depart the runway, the pilots did not reduce the throttles or apply brakes as they felt that it would be safer to attempt to get airborne. The airplane slowed as it departed the runway surface. It collided with a series of berms, which sheared off the left landing gear and left engine. The right landing gear collapsed, and the airplane came to rest in a nose down attitude. The operator stated that the student pilot inadvertently set the rudder trim to the full right position when he adjusted the rudder pedals during the prestart checks. The rudder trim was in the full right position for the takeoff, and found in the same position upon post accident inspection. The DC-3 involved was a turbine conversion and highly modified with a belly radar pod and chin FLIR turret. It was formerly operated by the South African Air Force as a maritime patrol aircraft. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The student pilot failed to follow the checklist and set the takeoff trim properly prior to takeoff resulting in a loss of directional control.

SAS Braathens flight 414 from Oslo Airport Gardermoen (ENGM) was approaching TromsÃ¸. During the descent, the fasten seatbelt sign was switched on at 15,000 ft in accordance with current company procedures. The cabin crew cleared and prepared the cabin. The aeroplane had descended to about 8 000 ft when it encountered clear airturbulence. The turbulence only lasted for a few seconds. One of the cabin crew at the back of the cabin had not had time to buckle up and lost her footing. She fell hard and broke her left ankle. The flight crew radioed air traffic control and informed them of the turbulence. It turned out that a warning had been issued for localised strong turbulence below 8,000 ft in the area in question (SIGMET). However, the alert was issued after the flight crew of SAS414 had planned their flight, and they had not received this information en route to TromsÃ¸. Normally, such information would have been communicated both by radio and via the aircraft's data link (Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System, ACARS). On the day in question, however, the ACARS system was faulty, so no SIGMET was sent out to any of the company's aircraft.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIBN Report number: 2009/17 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: AIBN Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates22-May-2024 18:36 ASN Added Corrections or additions? ...

Both pilots and 22 passengers were killed in the accident. Four passengers survived. The airplane had departed the Amazon city of Coari (CIZ) at 12:40 on a domestic flight to Manaus (MAO). About 13:10, while at FL115, the no. 1 engine flamed out. At 13:15 the crew made a contact with the Area Control Centre (ACC-AZ) reporting on descent for Manaus with twenty persons on board. In reality there were 28 occupants. The ACC controller instructed the crew to contact Manaus Approach Control. Subsequently, the pilot informed Manaus Approach that they would return to Coari. Contact was lost and at 13:24 radar contact was lost. The airplane came down in Rio Manacapuru. The airplane involved, an EMB-110P1, has a (certificated) maximum number of passenger seats of nineteen. On the accident flight 26 passengers had boarded the flight, including eight small children. Maximum takeoff weight for an EMB-110P1 is 5670 kg. The actual takeoff weight of the accident aircraft was 6414 kg. Contributing Factors 1 Human Factor 1.1 Medical Aspect It did not. 1.2 Psychological Aspect 1.2.1 Individual information 1.2.1.1 - Attitude - undetermined It is possible that the pilot's stated experience in this type of mission has influenced his permissive attitude towards situations contrary to what was predicted, raising his confidence in the ability to fulfill the mission, thus disregarding the risks involved. 1.2.1.2 - Culture of the working group - contributed There were no mass pilots conducting standardized procedures, such as briefing before and after each mission. They also showed an attitude of acceptance regarding the pilot's behavior not to carry out the intended procedures. Thus, attitudes were translated into informal rules of behavior in situations related to professional activity and safety. 1.2.2 Organizational Information 1.2.2.1 - Characteristics of the task - undetermined It is possible that the co-pilot took most of the flight preparation tasks in Coari, since it was customary for this to happen on missions with this commander. This may have interfered with the tasks under their responsibility, such as checking the number of people on board and giving passengers guidance on normal and emergency procedures. In addition, it is possible that the division of tasks relating to emergency procedures has been compromised, considering that some switches have been found in positions contrary to those recommended by the operations manual. 1.2.2.2 - Organizational Culture - contributed The company culture was reported as being focused on operational safety, however, in practice, what could be verified did not strengthen safe behaviors. Management did not supervise attitudes and did not control compliance with the procedures covered in the Operations Manual and in company training. There was a small participation of its crew members in prevention activities programmed by the company itself. 1.2.2.3 - Training, training and training - contributed There was no periodicity in training for emergency procedures. Despite the great experience of the commander, the lack of emergency training was present. Training of normal procedures, such as passing proper instructions to passengers, has also not been verified. 1.2.2.4 - Organization of work - contributed The procedures foreseen and established in the company's Operations Manual for operational safety were not applied, since the crew stopped transmitting the verbal instructions to the passengers, before takeoff and in the emergency situation. The crew made it possible to take off with excess weight and passengers, stopped communicating the emergency situation to the air traffic control agencies and allowed passengers to drink alcohol during the flight, facts that prove the accomplishment of the activities in an improvised way. 1.2.3 - Organizational processes - contributed 1.2.3.1 - Support systems - contributed Through the policy of granting total autonomy to the commander, the company was unaware of the decisions which, consequently, could affect the safety of the flight, as happened in relation to the refueling of the aircraft with less fuel And embark passengers in excess, thus demonstrating that there was no monitoring of activities in the operational scope. 1.2.3.10 - Other - contributed The blockage in the flow of information when the crew omitted information to Air Traffic Control and the lack of information to the passengers, during all the phases of the mission, made the assistance difficult in the face of the situation experienced, because if they had been The consequences could have been minimized. 1.3 Operational Aspect 1.3.1 Maintenance of the aircraft - contributed If the company's maintenance sector had performed the Oil Fuel Heater temperature check, it probably could have been verified that the thermal element had failed, which would lead to the replacement of the assembly, as recommended by the engine manufacturer's maintenance manual. It can not be said that such a failure was decisive for the engine failure, but evidenceAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: CENIPA Report number: A-018/CENIPA/2010 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: AviÃ£o com 24 pessoas cai em rio do Amazonas, 4 sobrevivem (O Globo, 7-2-2009)  Manaus AerotÃ¡xi  ForÃ§a AÃ©rea Brasileira   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Both crew members were killed. The airplane was chartered to carry out a medical flight to Cagliari to pick up a patient for transplant surgery at Bologna. But first the jet had to be flown from its home base at Roma-Ciampino Airport to Bologna Airport (BLQ) to pick up a medical team. At 05:54, shortly before departed, Ciampino Tower cleared flight 301 for a PEMAR 5 ALFA Standard Instrument Departure. Following a right hand turn after takeoff from runway 15, the jet was to fly towards the coastline at a heading of approx 240Â°. The flight took off from runway 15 at 06:00. After contacting the Roma Radar controller, the crew were received clearance to ""fly direct to Bolsena, climb level 240, no speed restriction."" This meant that the crew could continue the right hand turn after takeoff to a heading of 336Â° for a direct course to Bolsena. About half way the turn was discontinued. The airplane climbed in a shallow left hand turn which progressively became steeper. Altitude was lost and the airplane struck terrain nose down. CAUSE (translated from Italian report): The cause of the accident was due to an impact with the ground resulting from the loss of control of the aircraft by the captain, who was also the PF. It appears very likely that during the initial phase inadequate attention was replaced by a phase of spatial disorientation, resulting in a loss of situational awareness, which prompted an inadquate intervention on the flight controls by the PF, resulting in total loss of control of the aircraft (having accentuated the tilt to the left wing, instead of leveling the aircraft). It is reasonable to assume that the PF, based on the conviction of being in a right turn for Bolsena in IMC night conditions, misinterpreted the unusual turn, using the controls in order to accentuate the bank angle to the left, drastically reducing the vertical component of lift. This turn has consequently caused the aircraft to assume an attitude of increasing bank, a condition that has been aggravated by the continued application on the controls of a positive load factor in order to stop the sudden loss of altitude, without first leveling the wings. Or the aircraft is stabilized in a pronounced downward spiral to the left. The first officer (PNF), engaged in the management of navigation equipment, has created the unusual turn of the aircraft in conjunction with the commander (PF). Nevertheless, the considerable gradient of experience on the airplane and hierarchy within the organization between the captain and the first officer has probably prevented him to intervene in a more directive or authoritative way in the recovery phase of the situation. Also contributing to the outcome of the event was the lack of detail in the definition of the duties of the crew procedures and inadequate adherence to the basic principles of CRM/MCC, with reference to the monitoring and statement of the navigation modes active, navigation procedures and in particular to the lack of requests for inclusion of turns and routes, the deficiency in the performance of controls and optimization of automation that can lighten the workload in a time unfavorable from the point of view of the circadian rhythm and IMC night. In this respect, it seems fitting to remember the problem of spatial disorientation, although known and studied for decades, is still relevant, and that the only way to counter it is the application of proper use of instruments in compliance with the basic principles of CRM/MCC, which should  be part of the normal operating procedures of an operator.

En route the crew received information that it there was light snowfall at CDG. During the approach briefing the crew planned an ILS approach to runway 26L at 146 kt (Vref + 8 kt), full flaps, and autobrakes at medium. At 23:22 UTC (00:23 local time) the captain announced that the runway was in sight, as the aircraft was passes through a height of 240 feet. He then disconnected the autopilot. The aircraft was above the glideslope as the descent towards the runway was continued. After flying over the runway threshold at 85 ft, the captain began flaring at 40 ft. The aircraft touched down approximately 1050 m from the 26L threshold. Ground speed was 139 kt. With reversers selected at idle the crew noted that deceleration was not as expected. The captain then selected maximum reverse and began applying manual braking. At the end of the runway the captain steered the plane onto taxiway V1. At a ground speed of 41 knots the aircraft ran off the taxiway, coming to rest after 20 m. The left main gear and nose gear were damaged and deemed irreparable. The right main gear and 2 engine were also damaged. Causes of the accident: The accident was due to the continuation of landing when it touched down long and it was found that external conditions were more degraded than those previously reported to the crew. The following have contributed to the occurrence of this accident: - contamination of runway 08R/26L and degradation of the surface state (Rubber coating and deterioration of the surface) between 900 m and 300 m from THR 08R; - the erroneous determination of the runway 08R/26L conditions due to inadequate organization ground operations, monitoring the status of the platform in case of snow and maintenance of runways; - misinformation about the condition of the track, transmitted to the crew does not permit him to adopt the necessary measures; - non-use of thrust reversers.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Report number: f-aj090208 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Kazantzakis Airport (HER), Greece.  The airplane operated on a scheduled return flight between Heraklion and Rhodes. The entire return flight was uneventful until the landing back at Heraklion. The aircraft crossed the threshold with a speed of 112 kts and after flaring the captain, who was pilot flying, reduced speed to flight idle and touched down with a speed of 86 kts. As the speed was being gradually reduced, the captain had difficulty with controlling the aircraft along its longitudinal axis and noticing that the aircraft was leaning somewhat to the right, reported to the first officer that ""the gear has broken"". Immediately afterwards, the blades of the right propeller of the aircraft struck the runway. The aircraft continued to move with the left main landing gear wheel operating normally and the collapsed right main landing gear, folded backwards under the wing. The crew stopped the engines, reported to the Airport Control Tower that the right landing gear had broken and requested evacuation.  Investigation revealed that the forward yoke pintle on the right main landing gear fitted to SX-SKY failed on landing. The landing gear had flown 23,940 cycles since new and had been overhauled 148 landings prior to the accident. The aircraft landing weight was calculated to be 14,870 lb (6745 kg), which was within the maximum limit of 14,900 lb (6759 kg), and the FDR recorded a normal acceleration on landing of 1.79 g. A review of the data on the FDR identified two possible heavy landings of 2.5 g and 2.87 g that had occurred 5 and 27 landings prior to the accident.

The aircraft nose hit the snow wall frontally. The aircraft turned to the left and broke into two parts. CAUSES: The accident is attributable to the fact that the crew wanted to make a landing with inadequate visual references from an unfavourable initial position and as a result, after touchdown the aircraft collided with a snowbank running along the runway. The following factors contributed to the accident: - The rapidly changing weather conditions on the mountain aerodrome of Samedan were misjudged by the crew. - A coordinated crew working method in terms of crew resource management was missing. - The deactivation of the EGPWS, which meant that acoustic messages concerning the aircraftÂs height above ground and bank angle were no longer available in the final phase of the approach up to the first contact with the runway. - A snowbank up to four metres high ran along the edge of the runway.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BFU Switz.

The crash site was approximately 5 nautical miles northeast of the airport in Clarence Center, New York, and mostly confined to one residential house (6038 Long St, Clarence) . The four flight crew and 45 passengers were fatally injured and the aircraft was destroyed by impact forces and post crash fire. There was one ground fatality. Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.  Flight CJC3407 departed Newark-Liberty International Airport, NJ (EWR) at 21:20 on a domestic flight to Buffalo Airport, NY (BUF). At 22:15:14 the Buffalo Approach controller cleared the flight for an ILS approach to runway 23: ""Colgan thirty four zero seven three miles from klump turn left heading two six zero maintain two thousand three hundred till established localizer clear i l s approach runway two three."" The flight acknowledged that clearance. At 22:16:02, the engine power levers were reduced to flight idle. At that time Buffalo Approach instructed the crew to contact Buffalo Tower. The crew extended the landing gear and the auto flight system captured the ILS 23 localizer. The captain then moved the engine conditions levers forward to the maximum RPM position as the copilot acknowledged the instructions to Buffalo Tower.  At 22:16:28 the crew moved the flaps to 10Â°, and two seconds later the stall warning stick shaker activated. The autopilot disconnected at about the same time that the stick shaker activated. The crew added power to approximately 75% torque. The airplane began a sharp pitch up motion, accompanied by a left roll, followed by a right roll, during which the stick pusher activated. During this time, the indicated airspeed continued to decrease to less than 100 kts. Eight seconds after the flaps had been selected to 10Â°, and at an airspeed of less than 110 kts, the crew retracted the flaps. Sixteen seconds later the flaps were fully retracted. Following further pitch and roll excursions the airplane pitched down and entered a steep descent from which it did not recover. The airplane impacted a residential house and was destroyed. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the captainÂs inappropriate response to the activation of the stick shaker, which led to an aerodynamic stall from which the airplane did not recover. Contributing to the accident were (1) the flight crewÂs failure to monitor airspeed in relation to the rising position of the low-speed cue, (2) the flight crewÂs failure to adhere to sterile cockpit procedures, (3) the captainÂs failure to effectively manage the flight, and (4) Colgan AirÂs inadequate procedures for airspeed selection and management during approaches in icing conditions.""METAR: 02:54 UTC / 21:54 local time: KBUF 130254Z 24015G22KT 3SM -SN BR FEW011 BKN021 OVC027 01/M01 A2979 RMK AO2  SLP097 P0001 60004 T00061006 51015=Wind 240 degrees at 15 kts, gusting to 22kts; light snow, mist with a visibility of 3 miles; few clouds 1,100 ft.; broken clouds 2,100 ft.; overcast 2,700 ft.

The 71 occupants evacuated the aircraft using emergency slides.  The nose landing gear of flight BA8456 collapsed after touchdown at London City Airport (LCY) runway 28.  BBC News reported on May 25, 2009 that British Airways had written off the airplane. CONCLUSIONS: Following a normal touchdown, the fracture of the nose landing gear main fitting allowed the nose gear to collapse rearwards and penetrate the lower fuselage, causing significant damage to the equipment bay and the battery to become disconnected. The penetration of the fuselage allowed smoke and fumes produced by the consequent release of hydraulic fluid to enter the cockpit and passenger cabin. With the battery disconnected and after the engines were shut down, all power to the aircraft PA systems was lost and the remote cockpit door release mechanism became inoperative. No pre-accident defects were identified with the manual cockpit door release mechanism or the PA system. The nose landing gear main fitting failed following the formation of multiple fatigue cracks within the upper section of the inner bore, originating at the base of machining grooves in the bore surface. These had formed because the improved surface finish, introduced by SB 146-32-150, had not been properly embodied at previous overhaul by Messier Services Inc, despite their overhaul records showing its incorporation. The operator had been in full compliance with the Service Bulletin relating to regular inspection of the main fitting, and embodiment of SB 146-32-150 at overhaul removed the requirement for these inspections by the operator.Sources: BA jobs go after plane write-off (BBC, 25 May 2009)  BA jet in airport 'hard landing' (BBC, 14 February 2009)   Location  Images: photo (c) AAIB; London City Airport (LCY/EGLC); February 2009 photo (c) Harro Ranter; Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS/EHAM); 22 February 2002; (CC:by-nc-nd) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The captain stated that while en route to Kotzebue, the weather at the airport dropped below VFR minimums, and he received a special VFR clearance. He said that the local area and runway were covered with snow, but when he turned final he could see the airport beacon and associated buildings. He said about 200 feet above the ground on approach he lost sight of the runway environment, and asked the first officer if he could see anything. When the first officer said no, and reported their altitude at 50 feet agl, the captain said he initiated a go-around, but the airplane impacted the terrain short of the runway. The captain reported that there were no known mechanical problems with the airplane or its instruments prior to the accident. The Director of Operations for the operator said the airplane sustained structural damage to the fuselage near the left main landing gear.  An Federal Aviation Administration flight service specialist at the airport said the visibility had been about 1-1/4 miles, but dropped to 1/4-mile rapidly during the time of the approach. Weather observations taken at the airport showed that about 3 minutes before the accident, the visibility was 1 mile in light snow and blowing snow, wind as 160 degrees at 28 knots gusting to 32. About 1 minute before the accident, the visibility was reported as 1/4-mile in light snow and blowing snow, wind from 160 degrees at 33 knots gusting to 36. About 3 minutes after the accident, the visibility remained at 1/4-mile in light snow and blowing snow, and the wind was reported as 170 degrees at 35 knots with gusts to 42. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The flight crew's decision to continue flight into adverse weather. Contributing to the accident was blowing snow which limited their visibility during final approach to land.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ANC09LA019 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) Robin Gage; Kotzebue-Ralph Wien Memorial Airport, AK (OTZ); 14 February 2009 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft was previously owned by the Moldovian operator Aeriantur-M Airlines as ER-AXI. The airline ceased operations in January 2007 following an accident with one of its aircraft. It was subsequently sold to a private person and underwent C-check maintenance in the United Arab Emirates between March and May 2007. Meanwhile, in April. the Certificate of Airworthiness expired. There was information that the aircraft kept on flying in D.R. Congo. In 2008 Antonov was contacted to perform additional maintenance on the aircraft, which resulted in an agreement and a planned ferry flight in 2009. The aircraft certificate of temporary register in the state of Sao Tome as S9-SVN valid from 21 January 2009 until 20 February. A special flight permit was issued for a ferry flight valid till 20 February between Kisangani Airport, D.R. Congo Nikolaev Airport, Ukraine. The permit and the registration were for Aerolift Company Limited. The aircraft departed Kisangani and proceeded to Entebbe Airport, Uganda, and Luxor Airport in Egypt. After refuelling, the engines were started and the flight was cleared to taxi to runway 02 for departure. At 04:18 local time the aircraft began the takeoff roll. The aircraft failed to become airborne and continued rolling past the end of the runway into the sand. It crossed a service road and crashed into buildings in a military zone 500 meters from the runway end. After the accident numerous safety violations were discovered. The service life of the aircraft had expired and the Sao Tome authorities did not inspect the aircraft prior to issuing a temporary Certificate of Airworthiness and ferry permit.  The engines and propellers had reprinted numbers plates without documentation to confirm their service life or airworthiness. Additionally, the engines on the aircraft were of different types (AI-20M and AI-20K). The crew did not have enough time for rest. The decision of the crew to fly was influenced by the fact that the temporary certificate of airworthiness expired on 20 February, 2009. PROBABLE CAUSES OF THE ACCIDENT: - Lack of available thrust which corresponded to the power of only two engines running during take off run - Lack of authorized maintenance of the aircraft. - The uncoordinated crew actions in the critical situation (both pilots had previously flown as captains). The lack of coordination is confirmed by the braking trails left by the main landing gear at the end of RWY -02, based on FCOM instructions, and in case of rejected takeoff attempt, the crew had to set the throttles to idle, lower the nose gear to reach the runway and then use the propellers for braking (releasing them from the stops). Also, to reduce the roll and to maintain the direction they were to use the nose wheel steering and wheel brakes as well as emergency braking if needed. Actually the crew did neither of the above procedures, except using the main wheel brakes.METAR: 02:00 UTC / 04:00 local time: HELX 200200Z 17002KT CAVOK 14/01 Q1014 NOSIG=Wind 170 degrees, 2 kts, Ceiling unlimited, Sky clear, Temperature 14Â°C, Dewpoint 1Â°CAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: ECAA Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: Reuters  ukranews.com  ITAR-TASS   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

On board the aircraft was some cargo (a spare wheel, tools, etc.), with a total mass of 415 kg. The takeoff weight (5120 kg) and centre of gravity (26,3% MAC) were within limits. The airplane took off at 12:47 local time. About one minute after takeoff the crew reported that they were returning to the aerodrome of departure due to loss of engine power. The power was then lost almost completely, forcing the crew to carry out a forced landing in an agricultural field. This field contained deep slots, perpendicular to the direction of flight. On touchdown the left hand landing gear collapsed, along with the left hand wings. The reason for the loss of engine power in flight, most likely, was a reduction in the filing of the gasoline due to clogging of fuel filters. The appearance, structure and nature of the impurities found in the fuel on the aircraft were not characteristic of impurities accumulated in the fuel supply system in normal operating conditions. The source of the impurities in aircraft fuel system could not be found.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: - Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

When approximately one mile from the runway, the copilot decided to change the flight path to line up with the correct runway.  The pilot-in-command (PIC) reported that when the copilot rolled out on final approach, the airplane drifted to the right of the runway centerline.  The copilot began to correct the alignment; however, the airplane continued to drift right.  At 10 feet above the runway, the PIC instructed the co-pilot to perform a go-around.  The PIC stated that the right wing dropped and the right main tires settled on the runway during the go-around.  The copilot reported that the turn onto final approach was normal and that the airplane drifted slightly right of centerline when they crossed the airport boundary. The copilot reported that the winds were gusting out of the east (left side) during the landing.  The tower informed the flight crew that there was a white mist coming from their right tip tank.  Upon inspection the flight crew noticed fuel leaking from the right wing tip tank.  The airplane remained in the traffic pattern and then completed an uneventful landing.  The airplane sustained substantial damage to the outboard portion of the right wing.  Local winds reported 11 minutes prior to the accident were from 150 degrees at 6 knots, and 49 minutes after the accident the local winds were reported as being from 160 degrees at 5 knots.

Flight TK1951 departed Istanbul-AtatÃ¼rk International Airport (IST) for a flight to Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS), The Netherlands. The flight crew consisted of three pilots: a line training captain who occupied the left seat, a first officer under line training in the right seat and an additional first officer who occupied the flight deck jump seat. The first officer under line training was the pilot flying. The en route part of the flight was uneventful. The flight was descending for Schiphol and passed overhead Flevoland at about 8500 ft. At that time the aural landing gear warning sounded. The aircraft continued and was then directed by Air Traffic Control towards runway 18R for an ILS approach and landing. The standard procedure for runway 18R prescribes that the aircraft is lined up at least 8 NM from the runway threshold at an altitude of 2000 feet. The glidepath is then approached and intercepted from below. Lining up at a distance between 5 and 8 NM is allowed when permitted by ATC.  Flight 1951 was vectored for a line up at approximately 6 NM at an altitude of 2000 feet. The glide slope was now approached from above. The crew performed the approach with one of the two autopilot and autothrottle engaged.  The landing gear was selected down and flaps 15 were set. While descending through 1950 feet, the radio altimeter value suddenly changed to -8 feet. And again the aural landing gear warning sounded. This could be seen on the captainÂs (left-hand) primary flight display. The first officerÂs (right-hand) primary flight display, by contrast, indicated the correct height, as provided by the right-hand system. The left hand radio altimeter system, however, categorised the erroneous altitude reading as a correct one, and did not record any error. In turn, this meant that it was the erroneous altitude reading that was used by various aircraft systems, including the autothrottle. The crew were unaware of this, and could not have known about it. The manuals for use during the flight did not contain any procedures for errors in the radio altimeter system. In addition, the training that the pilots had undergone did not include any detailed system information that would have allowed them to understand the significance of the problem. When the aircraft started to follow the glidepath because of the incorrect altitude reading, the autothrottle moved into the Âretard flareÂ mode. This mode is normally only activated in the final phase of the landing, below 27 feet. This was possible because the other preconditions had also been met, including flaps at (minimum) position 15. The thrust from both engines was accordingly reduced to a minimum value (approach idle). This mode was shown on the primary flight displays as ÂRETARDÂ. However, the right-hand autopilot, which was activated, was receiving the correct altitude from the right-hand radio altimeter system. Thus the autopilot attempted to keep the aircraft flying on the glide path for as long as possible. This meant that the aircraftÂs nose continued to rise, creating an increasing angle of attack of the wings. This was necessary in order to maintain the same lift as the airspeed reduced. In the first instance, the pilotsÂ only indication that the autothrottle would no longer maintain the pre-selected speed of 144 knots was the RETARD display. When the speed fell below this value at a height of 750 feet, they would have been able to see this on the airspeed indicator on the primary flight displays. When subsequently, the airspeed reached 126 knots, the frame of the airspeed indicator also changed colour and started to flash. The artificial horizon also showed that the nose attitude of the aircraft was becoming far too high. The cockpit crew did not respond to these indications and warnings. The reduction in speed and excessively high pitch attitude of the aircraft were not recognised until the approach to stall warning (stick shaker) went off at an altitude of 460 feet.  The first officer responded immediately to the stick shaker by pushing the control column forward and also pushing the throttle levers forward. The captain however, also responded to the stick shaker commencing by taking over control. Assumingly the result of this was that the first officerÂs selection of thrust was interrupted. The result of this was that the autothrottle, which was not yet switched off, immediately pulled the throttle levers back again to the position where the engines were not providing any significant thrust. Once the captain had taken over control, the autothrottle was disconnected, but no thrust was selected at that point. Nine seconds after the commencement of the first approach to stall warning, the throttle levers were pushed fully forward, but at that point the aircraft had already stalled and the height remaining, of about 350 feet, was insufficient for a recovery. According to the last recorded data of the digital flight data recorder the aircraft was in a 22Â° ANU and 10Â° Left Wing Down (LWD) position at the moment of impact. The airplane impacted farmland. The horizontal stabilizer and both main landing gear legs were separated from the aircraft and located near the initial impact point. The left and right engines had detached from the aircraft. The aft fuselage, with vertical stabilizer, was broken circumferentially forward of the aft passenger doors and had sustained significant damage. The fuselage had ruptured at the right side forward of the wings. The forward fuselage section, which contained the cockpit and seat rows 1 to 7, had been significantly disrupted. The rear fuselage section was broken circumferentially around row 28. The Dutch Safety Board has reached the following main conclusion: During the accident flight, while executing the approach by means of the instrument landing system with the right autopilot engaged, the left radio altimeter system showed an incorrect height of -8 feet on the left primary flight display. This incorrect value of -8 feet resulted in activation of the Âretard flareÂ mode of the autothrottle, whereby the thrust of both engines was reduced to a minimal value (approach idle) in preparation for the last phase of the landing. Due to the approach heading and altitude provided to the crew by air traffic control, the localizer signal was intercepted at 5.5 NM from the runway threshold with the result that the glide slope had to be intercepted from above. This obscured the fact that the autothrottle had entered the retard flare mode. In addition, it increased the crewÂs workload. When the aircraft passed 1000 feet height, the approach was not stabilised so the crew should have initiated a go around. The right autopilot (using data from the right radio altimeter) followed the glide slope signal. As the airspeed continued to drop, the aircraftÂs pitch attitude kept increasing. The crew failed to recognise the airspeed decay and the pitch increase until the moment the stick shaker was activated. Subsequently the approach to stall recovery procedure was not executed properly, causing the aircraft to stall and crash.METAR: 09:25 UTC / 10:25 local time: EHAM 250925Z 20010KT 4500 BR SCT007 BKN008 OVC010 04/03 Q1027 TEMPO 2500=Wind 200 degrees, 10 kts, visibility 4500 m in mist, scattered clouds 700 ft., 	broken clouds 800ft, overcast 1,000 ft. temperature 4 deg.

The fire ignited combustible materials, including insulation blankets and spread upwards toward a flexible oxygen line mounted above the JB-1 junction box. The flexible oxygen line ignited when exposed to the fire, and the fire burned through the aircraft's fuselage. Evidence suggests that the fire initiated as a result of an electrical anomaly in the top portion of the JB-1 junction box, near bus bar and contactor components. This evidence includes melting of one side of the bus bar along the periphery of its connection to a terminal stud and severe thermal damage to the internal and, to a lesser degree, external surfaces of the K1XB contactor case. Despite the damage to the contactor case, the internal contacts did not appear to be stuck or exhibit signs of melting or excessive pitting. There were no other signs of arcing near any of these components. Numerous maintenance difficulties had occurred on the aircraft involving the external AC power supply system beginning approximately 10-weeks before the accident. To attempt to remedy the anomalies, several relays, electrical contactors, the AC power switch, the external ground power receptacle, and other electrical components were removed and replaced with new components. Several of these components were located in the upper section of the JB-1 junction box. The last of these actions occurred about 5-weeks before the accident. Probable Cause: An electrical anomaly in the top portion of the JB-1 junction box resulting in ignition of adjacent combustible materials, including insulation blankets, and a flexible oxygen line.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA09FA033 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates02-Mar-2009 09:47 harro Updated 16-Oct-2013 20:48 Anon.

The right main gear would not extend in the down and locked position. The crew attempted a landing with the right main gear up and possibly hoped to free the gear to extend, however, this was unsuccessful and they subsequently elected to land gear up on their second approach. The aircraft landed successfully on its belly and came to a stop on the runway. The aircraft landed between Taxiways P and Q and all 10 occupants were evacuated and were transported to the hospital as a precaution. There were no obvious injuries and there was no fire after landing. The aircraft sustained substantial damage to its propellers, flaps and aft belly area. Inspection by TSB indicated that the inboard right main landing gear door partially hung up on the wheel well structure, preventing the extension of the landing gear. The reason for the gear door interference is under investigation. This aircraft was involved in an unsafe gear incident the previous day at Winnipeg. FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1. The right inboard landing gear door was incorrectly rigged, which reduced the clearance between the tire and gear door during gear extension. The mis-rigged landing gear door likely went unnoticed through four separate inspections. 2. The combined effect of the mis-rigged gear door, the installation of a new re-capped tire with large dimensions, growing free play in the gear door bushings/linkage arrangement, and air loading on the gear door reduced clearances sufficiently that the number three tire caught on a ledge on the inboard door skin, preventing the right main gear from extending.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A09C0028 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: CADORS Number: 2009C0523  CADORS Number: 2009C0528 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  27 January 2025 C-FSLZ Perimeter Aviation 0 5 nm S of Norway House unk Fumes/smoke/odor event Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All three crew members were killed. The Saras airplane was scheduled for carrying out test flight no 49, which would include inflight engine shut down and relight procedure at 10000 feet AMSL.  The aircraft took-off from Bangalore-Hindustan Airport (BLR) at 14:55. The flight was cleared to flight level 100. After completing general handling checks at 9000ÂAMSL without any events, a single engine simulated approach was carried out on runway 09. At about 15:11 the crew were cleared to perform an overshoot.  The crew contacted the Bangalore Radar controller, who cleared them back to FL100 and proceed to sector Southwest 2 for carrying out the engine relight test procedure. The crew reported reaching 9000ÂAMSL in sector Southwest at about 15:18.  The no. 1 engine was then shut down and secured following the test procedure at about 15:31. After about 47 seconds, the no. 1 engine relight procedure was initiated at around 9200ÂAMSL. After a successful left engine shut down and its securing procedure, at about 15:31 left engine relight procedure was initiated at about 9200ÂAMSL. The propeller blade pitch was selected from feathered to fine. This led to an increased in propeller rpm from 5 to 55%. Side slip increased up to 28 degrees and bank angle changed from 8 deg right to 70 degrees left. The pitch attitude was seen reaching -42 degrees. Propeller rpm continued to increase to 91%. Then the aircraft went into a sudden dive from 9200Â to 7300Â for about 13 secs. The aircraft was brought under control at this altitude. The crew continued their attempt to relight the engine but this was not successful. Meanwhile the side slip remained at 22 degrees with a pitch attitude of about -15 deg. The speed remained at 130 kt and altitude reduced from 7000 feet to 5200 feet. A second relight attempt was successful but the airplane was still in a rapid descent passing 4800 feet. Rudder pedal forces increased to as high as 90 kg with aileron forces raising to 40 kg. The crew were not able to fully control the airplane and arrest the descent. It impacted the ground. The aircraft was completely destroyed due impact and fire. PROBABLE CAUSE(S): Incorrect relight procedure devised by the designer and adopted by the crew at insufficient height leading to rapid loss of altitude and abnormal behavior of aircraft resulted into accident.

The co-pilot was the handling pilot for the sector. During the approach to runway 25L, the weather conditions at the airport were reported as wind 200 degrees at 20 knots, visibility 1,500 meters, and rain. Based on this information, the captain decided to take over control from the co-pilot for the landing. The captain later reported that he had the runway in sight passing through 1,000 feet on descent, so disengaged the auto pilot at 400 feet. At about 50 feet the aircraft drifted to the right and the captain initiated corrective action to regain the centreline. The aircraft touched down to the left of the runway 25 centerline and then commenced to drift to the right. The captain reported that he immediately commenced corrective action by using thrust reverser, but the aircraft increasingly crabbed along the runway with the tail to the right of runway heading.

The mishap aircraft terminated its mission and returned to Al Udeid Air Base, Qatar. The crew and mission personnel evacuated the aircraft safely without injury. The mishap occurred during operations in the Area of Responsibility (AOR). The mishap crew had begun aerial refuelling with a KC-135, when the mishap crew and personnel aboard heard and felt a loud bang throughout the midsection of the aircraft. The crew suspended refuelling to evaluate the aircraft to checkout their systems and evaluate the aircraft for any damage. Finding nothing apparently wrong, the crew re-latched to the tanker and attempted to continue the refuelling when another series of loud noises and vibrations were heard and felt throughout the aircraft. Personnel aboard the KC-135 observed a stream of vapour and fuel streaming from the E-8 and alerted the crew. The crew checked for damage through a rear window and observed fuel streaming from at least two holes in the left wing, just inboard of the number two engine. The crew opted to terminate the mission and return to Al Udeid. Maintenance personnel then examined the airplane and found that the number two main fuel tank had ruptured, causing extensive damage to the wing of the airplane. The Accident Investigation Board (AIB) President found, by clear and convincing evidence, that the mishap was caused when a civilian subcontractor employee inadvertently left a test plug in the fuel vent system of the Mishap Aircraft during recently completed Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM) performed on the MA. Additionally, the AIB President found by substantial evidence three factors which contributed to the mishap. First, the PDM subcontractor employed ineffective tool control measures. Second, the PDM subcontractor failed to follow Technical Order (TO) mandated procedures when employing the fuel vent test plug during PDM. Third, due to the relatively short period of time between takeoff and refuelling, the crew did not have the opportunity to burn a substantial amount of fuel from the number two fuel tank which could have allowed the dive ""flapper"" valve to open after the tanks excessive air pressure decreased to the point where the flapper valve would open. This explains why this mishap did not occur during ARs conducted between the time the MA left the PDM facility and the time of the mishap.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: USAF AIB Report number: Executive summary report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Scramble 402  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

The flight crew aborted the takeoff as the airplane was accelerating through 80 knots. Upon exiting the runway, the flight crew verified normal operation of both engines. The captain reported that he had no reason to suspect hot brakes due to minimal use and taxied back to the active runway where the flight was subsequently cleared for takeoff. During the second takeoff, which was initiated about 5 minutes and 43 seconds after the initial rejected takeoff, the flight crew heard and felt a loud bang followed by a sudden yaw to the right; the flight crew immediately aborted the takeoff. Shortly after, the flight crew heard a second loud bang, followed by a more severe yaw to the right. The flight crew slowed the airplane and exited onto a taxiway at the end of the runway. Upon exiting the airplane, the captain observed a fire near the left main landing gear and immediately evacuated the airplane. Examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed that the left main landing gear exhibited fire damage and that the tire was blown. A punctured hole within the right side of the fuselage was observed just aft of the cockpit. The flight crew reported that at the time of the accident the airplane weighed 20,772 pounds. Review of emergency procedures within the aircraft flight manual revealed that a high energy stop inspection of the aircraft was required following the initial rejected takeoff due to the aircraft exceeding the maximum brake energy weight at the time of the initial rejected takeoff. The maximum brake energy weight was calculated to be 20,300 pounds. Probable Cause: The flight crew's failure to follow the manufacturerâs aircraft flight manual emergency procedures following a rejected takeoff that required a high energy stop inspection. Contributing to the accident was the flight's exceedence of the aircraft's maximum brake energy weight.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: WPR09LA151 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates18-Mar-2009 11:59 harro Added 18-Mar-2009 12:03 harro Updated 21-Dec-2016 19:25 ASN Update Bot Updated [Time, Damage, Category, Investigating agency, ]01-Dec-2017 12:16 ASN Update Bot Updated [Cn, Operator, Other fatalities, Nature, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The takeoff was planned as a reduced-power takeoff and the first officer was the handling pilot for the departure. At 22:31:53, the captain called for the first officer to rotate. The first officer attempted to rotate the aircraft, but it did not respond immediately with a nose-up pitch. The captain again called 'rotate' and the first officer applied a greater nose-up command. The nose of the aircraft was raised and the tail made contact with the runway surface, but the aircraft did not begin to climb. The captain then selected TOGA on the thrust levers, the engines responded immediately, and the aircraft commenced a climb. The crew notified air traffic control of the tail strike and that they would be returning to Melbourne. While reviewing the aircraftÂs performance documentation in preparation for landing, the crew noticed that a takeoff weight, which was 100 tonnes below the actual takeoff weight of the aircraft, had inadvertently been used when completing the takeoff performance calculation. The result of that incorrect takeoff weight was to produce a thrust setting and takeoff reference speeds that were lower than those required for the actual aircraft weight. The aircraft subsequently landed at Melbourne with no reported injuries. The tail strike resulted in substantial damage to the tail of the aircraft and damaged some airport lighting and the instrument landing system. As a result of the accident, the aircraft operator has advised the Australian Transport Safety Bureau that it is reviewing a number of procedures including human factors involved in takeoff performance data entry. CONTRIBUTING SAFETY FACTORS: - The first officer inadvertently entered the incorrect take-off weight into the electronic flight bag to calculate the take-off performance parameters for the flight. - The captain was distracted while checking the take-off performance figures in the electronic flight bag, which resulted in him not detecting the incorrect take-off weight. - During the pre-departure phase, the flight crew did not complete all of the tasks in the standard operating procedures, which contributed to them not detecting the error. - When conducting the loadsheet confirmation procedure, the first officer called out 362.9 tonnes as the FLEX take-off weight, rather than the 262.9 tonnes that was recorded on the master flight plan, which removed an opportunity for the captain to detect the error. - The first officer changed the first digit of the FLEX take-off weight on the master flight plan during the loadsheet confirmation procedure, believing it had been transcribed incorrectly, which removed an opportunity for the flight crew to detect the error. - The lack of a designated position in the pre-flight documentation to record the green dot speed precipitated a number of informal methods of recording that value, lessening the effectiveness of the green dot check within the loadsheet confirmation procedure.

The airplane contacted Narita Tower at 06:41 and received a landing clearance for runway 34L. Wind information passed on to the crew indicated gusting winds. As the airplane was probably flying through rough air, the autopilot and autothrottle had difficulties to control airspeed and attitude.  At 06:47:40 the CAWS announced 500 ft. The calibrated airspeed (CAS) was frequently fluctuating and at this moment the CAS was about 179 kts. The range of CAS fluctuation was from 152 to 180 kt which was 12 kts slower and 16 kts faster than the selected approach speed of 164 kts. This exceeded the stabilized approach criteria. The pilot monitoring called ""stabilize"" and most likely let the pilot flying continue approaching, disregarding airspeed deviation of more than Vapp plus 10 kt.  The autopilot was disconnected at 198 ft radio altitude, while the autothrottle remained engaged. The pitch angle then decreased from 1.4Â° while the CAS was 178.5 kts. The airplane was almost on the glide slope at this point. Just after the autopilot was disconnected, the pitch angle temporarily decreased as low as 0.4Â° but it increased to 3.5Â° by the time the airplane descended to 92 ft.  In the meantime, the CAS decreased as low as 154 ft (Vapp minus 10 kt) and the airplane descended about half a dot below the glide slope. It is highly probable that this large speed decrease stemmed from the inability of the autothrottle system to counteract the large wind velocity change (decreasing head wind component) during the descent and the fact that the thrust was kept at idle during the increment of the pitch angle to 3.5Â°. The increased pitch angle and corresponding column input indicates the pilot flying's intention to correct the lowered flight path.  The CAS increased to 161 kt from 154 kt, but it was still slower than Vapp (164 kt). The deviation from the glide slope had increased to -1.11 dot.  The pilot flying began correcting the heading to correct for the cross wind component from the left and align the longitudinal axis with the runway centerline.  When the radio altimeter indicated about 48 ft, the pitch angle was 1.1Â° and a sink rate was about 13 fps. The autothrottle was engaged, and the thrust levers were in the retard mode which started to automatically decrease the thrust below 50 ft, reaching idle when descending through 20 ft.  The pilot flying initiated the flare later than usual at 20 ft, not at 30 ft. Rapid and large column input during flare indicates the pilot's recognition of the late flare. The pitch angle remained 1.1Â° (about 2Â° lower than usual) until the flare, and the pitch angle temporarily decreased to 0.7Â° (below 20 ft) followed by the quick increment of the pitch angle to 4.6Â° in 2 seconds before touchdown.  The control column was pushed largely forward (-4.9Â°) just before the touchdown. The airplane consequently experienced a large sink rate upon the first touchdown as high as 7 fps. Vertical acceleration spiked to 1.63 G and the airplane bounced. The forward control column input just before and during the touchdown most likely resulted in the rapid derotation from 4.6Â° at the first touchdown to below zero in 1.5 seconds. The decreasing pitch angle, with the main landing gear still in the air, may have made it difficult for the pilot flying to recognize the need for bounce recovery due to his lowering eye point. It may be possible that he didn't realize the airplane had bounced. The airplane then touched down on the nose landing gear with a pitch angle of -1.8Â°, followed later by the main landing gear. After touchdown the nosegear rebounded off quickly increasing the pitch angle, leading to increased lift, resulting in a high bounce to 16 ft above the runway.  The nose dropped again and the airplane landed on the nosegear followed by the main landing gears. As the airplane was rolling to the left, the left main gear first touched down, followed by the center landing gear and the right main gear. The recorded vertical acceleration at this time was 3.06 G. The airplane sink rate was estimated to be 21.5 fps at the third touchdown. It is highly probable that the airplaneÂs kinetic energies at the third touchdown exceeded the certification requirements by almost seven times.  The left wing attachment point to the fuselage fractured. The fuselage rolled to the left with the lift generated by the right wing and a fire erupted. The airplane rolled inverted and was consumed by fire. PROBABLE CAUSES: In this accident, when the airplane landed on Runway 34L at Narita International Airport, it fell into porpoising. It is highly probable that the left wing fractured as the load transferred from the left MLG to the left wing structure on the third touchdown surpassed the design limit (ultimate load).  It is highly probable that a fire broke out as the fuel spillage from the left wing caught fire, and the airplane swerved left off the runway rolling to the left and came to rest inverted on the grass area.  The direct causes which the airplane fell into the porpoise phenomenon are as follows:  a. Large nose-down elevator input at the first touchdown resulted in a rapid nose-down motion during the first bounce, followed by the second touchdown on the NLG with negative pitch attitude. Then the pitch angle rapidly increased by the ground reaction force, causing the larger second bounce, and  b. The PF's large elevator input in an attempt to control the airplane without thrust during the second bounce.  In addition, the indirect causes are as follows:  a. Fluctuating airspeed, pitch attitude due to gusty wind resulted in an approach with a large sink rate,  b. Late flare with large nose-up elevator input resulted in the first bounce and  c. Large pitch attitude change during the bounce possibly made it difficult for the crewmembers to judge airplane pitch attitude and airplane height relative to the ground (MLG height above the runway).  d. The PM's advice, override and takeover were not conducted adequately.  It is somewhat likely that, if the fuse pin in the MLG support structure had failed and the MLG had been separated in the overload condition in which the vertical load is the primary component, the damage to the fuel tanks would have been reduced to prevent the fire from developing rapidly.  It is probable that the fuse pin did not fail because the failure mode was not assumed under an overload condition in which the vertical load is the primary component due to the interpretation of the requirement at the time of type certification for the MD-11 series airplanes.METAR: 21:00 UTC / 06:00 local time: RJAA 222100Z 30013G28KT 260V330 9999 FEW020 13/M01 Q0998 NOSIG21:00 UTC / 06:00 local time: RJAA 222100Z 30013G28KT 260V330 9999 FEW020 13/M01 Q0998 NOSIG RMK 1CU020 A2948 21:08 UTC / 06:08 local time: RJAA 222108Z 31025G35KT 9999 FEW020 12/M01 Q0998 RMK 1CU020 A294921:30 UTC / 06:30 local time: RJAA 222130Z 32026G40KT 9999 FEW020 12/M02 Q0999 WS R34L NOSIG21:30 UTC / 06:30 local time: RJAA 222130Z 32026G40KT 9999 FEW020 12/M02 Q0999 WS R34L NOSIG RMK 1CU020 A2952 P/RR21:30 UTC / 06:30 local time: RJAA 222130Z 32026G40KT 9999 FEW020 12/M02 Q0999 WS R34L NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: JTSB Report number: AA2013-4 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: Kyodo, Asahi  JTSB History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  19 May 1999 N813DE Delta Air Lines 0 Cambridge Airport, Teversham, Cambridge sub Tailstrike Location  Images: photo (c) JTSB; Tokyo-Narita Airport (NRT/RJAA); 23 March 2009 photo (c) JTSB; Tokyo-Narita Airport (NRT/RJAA); 23 March 2009 photo (c) JTSB; Tokyo-Narita Airport (NRT/RJAA); 23 March 2009 photo (c) JTSB; Tokyo-Narita Airport (NRT/RJAA); 23 March 2009 photo (c) JTSB; Tokyo-Narita Airport (NRT/RJAA); 23 March 2009 photo (c) JTSB; Tokyo-Narita Airport (NRT/RJAA); 23 March 2009 photo (c) Harro Ranter; ZÃ¼rich-Kloten Airport (ZRH/LSZH) [HB]; 03 August 2002 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All six crew members were killed. The flight departed Jayapura (DJJ) on an scheduled cargo/passenger flight to Wamena (WMX). The airplane carried staples such as rice and flour. The crew consisted of a captain, co-pilot, engineer, loadmaster and two flight attendants.  The aircraft was being operated under the instrument flight rules (IFR) for the sector from Sentani, and a visual descent, approach and landing at Wamena, because there was no published instrument approach procedure at Wamena. There was low cloud with a base of 300 meters on the final approach track to runway 15 at Wamena. The aircraft tracked parallel to, and to the right of the extended runway 15 centreline. During that approach, and while descending through 6,234 feet (790 feet by radio altimeter), the EGPWS voice aural alert 'TERRAIN TERRAIN' sounded. When the aircraft was passing 6,200 feet (991 feet by radio altimeter) on descent, the EGPWS voice aural alert 'WHOOP WHOOP, PULL UP' sounded. The aircraft started turning left toward runway as it was passing 5,719 feet (540 feet radio altimeter) on descent. As the aircraft passed 5,693 feet (516 feet radio altimeter) on descent, the crew informed the controller that they had the runway in sight. During their attempt to intercept the final approach track, while passing 5,531 feet (320 feet radio altimeter) the captain commented to the copilot ""wah nembak lagi"" [we are overshooting again]. During the interception towards the runway an EGPWS voice aural alert 'SINK RATE', sounded. This was immediately followed by the voice aural alert 'WHOOP WHOOP, PULL UP' sounding five times. The copilot instructed the captain ""overshoot, overshoot"" after the second of the five 'WHOOP WHOOP, PULL UP' sounds. The FDR showed that the aircraft commenced a go around from a low height above the runway. The controller offered the crew a choice of a landing on runway 33, but the crew elected to make a right circuit for runway 15. The circuit was flown at a height of between 150 and 350 feet above the aerodrome elevation. During the downwind leg the EGPWS provided the flight crew with eight 'DON'T SINK' and one 'TOO LOW TERRAIN' voice aural alerts. The flight crew did not respond to any of those alerts. As the aircraft passed abeam the threshold of runway 15, the landing gear was lowered for the second landing approach. During the right base turn the aircraft was initially flown at a constant 30 degree angle of right bank. About 100 degrees from runway heading, the copilot said ""OK, sungai ketok"" [OK river in sight]. Four seconds later, when about 85 degrees from runway heading the copilot said ""Pike clear"" [Pike Hill visible]. As the aircraft's heading passed 65 degrees from the runway heading, the copilot called ""be careful pak"" [be careful sir]. A third person in the cockpit commented ""di kiri ada bukit"" [there is a hill on the left]. This was immediately followed, as the aircraft banked through 41 degrees right, by the copilot calling out with increasing concern, ""pak, pak, pak, open pak, kiri, kiri"" [sir, sir, sir, open, sir, left, left]. The engine power was rapidly increased immediately after the copilot called ""open pak"" [open sir]. The copilot commanded ""kiri pak""[left sir] as the captain rolled the aircraft into a left bank and the EGPWS voice aural alert 'DON'T SINK, DON'T SINK' sounded. As the bank angle exceeded 40 degrees, it entered a 10-degree nosedown pitch attitude. The copilot warned the captain ""don't sink"". The captain immediately responded ""ya, ya"". Three seconds later the copilot said ""left turn"". The EGPWS then sounded the following voice aural alerts in rapid succession: 'TOO LOW - TERRAIN', 'BANK ANGLE - BANK ANGLE', 'TERRAIN - TERRAIN'. At the same time as the EGPWS sounded the 'TERRAIN - TERRAIN' warning, the copilot called with high intonation ""pak, pak, pak"" [sir, sir, sir]. The nose-down pitch attitude reached 6 degrees when the aircraft reached 49 degrees left bank. As the aircraft reached 49 degrees left bank, landing gear retraction commenced. The EGPWS voice aural alert then sounded TERRAIN, and one second later the copilot called ""pak"" [sir]. At the point of impact with the terrain, the landing gear was half way through the retraction cycle, the left bank was 16 degrees, and the aircraft pitch was 12 degrees nose up. The indicated airspeed at impact was 146 knots. The aircraft impacted Pikei Hill on Tengah Mountain.  Wamena Airport is situated at the Baliem Valley with an airport elevation of 5085 feet and surrounded by mountains up to 12.000 feet high. The only navigation aid available is NDB "" ZW"". The instrument approach procedure is not available for this aerodrome. This aerodrome is VFR operation only. CAUSES: The crew did not appear to have awareness of the aircraftÂs proximity with terrain until impact with terrain was imminent. The flight crew did not act on the Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System aural warnings, and did not conform to the operatorÂs published operating procedures. Together, those factors resulted in the aircraftÂs impact with terrain.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSC Report number: KNKT 09.12.04.01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Antara  Tempo Interaktif  Ministry of Transportation (Indonesia), press release History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  22 July 2008 PK-BRD Aviastar Mandiri 0 Jayapura-Sentani Airport (DJJ/WAJJ) Location  Images: photo (c) NTSC; near Wamena Airport (WMX/WAJW); April 2009 photo (c) NTSC; near Wamena Airport (WMX/WAJW); April 2009 photo (c) NTSC; near Wamena Airport (WMX/WAJW); April 2009 photo (c) NTSC; April 2009 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

One 6 year old boy died, and seven others were badly injured. The Aereotuy plane carried ten tourists on a flight to Ciudad BolÃ­var. During takeoff the airplane could not gain altitude, continued off the departure end, and collided with a powerline, 80 meters past the end of runway 36. Weather conditions at the time of the accident were poor due to cumulo nimbus clouds to the north of the airfield. There were puddles of water on the runway as a result of rainfall. Runway 36 is a 2100 m long asphalt runway. The airplane lined up for takeoff on the last third of the runway. Cause (translated from Spanish) The accident occurred as a result of the inability of the aircraft to take off, affected by the tailwind and water puddles that covered part of the runway, which did not allow speed to build up, crashing into the ground. It is considered that the most likely cause of the accident was mismanagement by the crew, in the sense of failing to make adequate planning and analysis, coupled with overconfidence and lack of identification of hazardous conditions at that time of takeoff. Based on our [JIAAC] investigations, we can infer that there were several contributing causes for the occurrence of this accident. In this order, we can state the following: - Adverse weather and tailwind conditions associated with the phenomenon. - Incorrect management by the crew to use only the last third of the runway with the meteorological conditions prevailing at that time. - Failure of the aerodrome administration to identify and correct poor drainage of the runway. - Failure of the Autoridad AeronÃ¡utica to monitor safety. - Rejection by the crew of the concatenated form in which the factors involved in this event developed. After all the analysis to different causes involved in this accident, we can point to as the main Causal Factor: Human Factor, due to the mismanagement by the flight crew upon takeoff in these conditions. Physical and Material factors included everything related to the prevailing weather conditions, road conditions and lack of services at the aerodrome by the authorities; all of them are considered Contributing Factors.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JIAAC Venezuela Report number: 025/2009 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: Rescate ORH  NTSB   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were no injuries to the 210 passengers or 10 crew members onboard but the airplane received substantial damage. During the initial approach, the flight encountered gusty wind conditions (16 knots gusting to 24 knots). As a result, the flight crew added an appropriate wind additive to the reference landing speed (Vref). The airplane touched down in the touchdown zone approximately 1,600 feet from the threshold with a recorded normal acceleration (Nz) consistent with a ""firm"" landing. As the main gear touched down, a full nose down column was applied that produced a very high nose-down pitch rate, which resulted in a hard nose gear touchdown. The recorded normal acceleration at nose gear touchdown was 1.8 g, however, the actual load applied at the nose gear was much higher because the accelerometers are located in the main gear wheel well. The peak nose gear load experienced at nose gear contact exceeded the design-limit load by as much as 46%. The recorded normal and pitch accelerations, calculated data, and estimated nose gear loads confirm that the aircraft experienced a bending moment that exceeded both the design requirements and the structural capability of the fuselage. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The first officerÂs input of full nose down elevator at touchdown.

Thinking this was residual fuel, he 'spooled the engine.Ã¢â¬Â Realizing there was a fire, he called for assistance and shut off the fuel selectors and firewall shutoff valve. After the accident, a FAA inspector examined the airplane and reported extensive thermal damage to the fuselage sub-frame and evidence of an engine fire. Numerous engine turbine blades were found on the pavement adjacent to where the fire occurred. A disassembly and inspection of the engine revealed that one or more of the compressor turbine (CT) blades failed. The engine was overhauled about 6 hours prior to the accident. The CT blades were manufactured under the FAA Parts Manufacture Approval (PMA) program. Extreme heat damage obliterated the fracture surfaces of the blades, therefore the reason for the blade failure(s) could not be determined. A functional test of the fuel control unit (FCU) revealed the Sg (specific gravity) dome, high idle stop screw, and minimum flow stop were set above the recommended range, which would result in higher than normal fuel flow. The FCU adjustments appeared to be made after the overhaul, however it could not be determined when the adjustments occurred. Although the higher than normal fuel flow setting probably did not result in the CT blade failures, it could have exacerbated the thermal damage and fire. Probable Cause: A loss of engine power due to the failure of one or more compressor turbine blades for an undetermined reason.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA09LA269 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB ERA09LA269  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates03-Oct-2022 19:43 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

There were no injuries and there was some damage to the aircraft. Findings as to Causes and Contributing Factors 1. The crewmembers were likely focused on having the pilot flying (PF) achieve a successful flare, to the exclusion of monitoring other approach parameters. 2. The captain provided vague instructions on managing power during the approach and the resultant settings went unchecked, resulting in an undesirable descent rate close to the ground. 3. The engine power was not adjusted sufficiently to arrest the descent rate and the aircraft was pitched to the contact angle in the flare, resulting in the aft fuselage striking the runway.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A09O0073 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight was a regularly scheduled passenger flight which departed from Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport, MN (MSP) at 11:39. The flight to the DEN area was reported as routine, with VFR weather prevailing. At about 12:02, as the flight was entering the DEN terminal area, the crew briefed an approach speed of 139 knots for a visual approach to runway 16L. The First Officer (FO) was the pilot flying (PF) and reported the approach was stable at 1,000 feet above the runway threshold. At 12:16:15 ATC cleared the flight to land and issued a wind advisory of 260 degrees at 5 knots. The flight crew extended the gear and selected flaps 3. The autopilot was disengaged at 12:17:38, at approximately 750 feet above touchdown. The auto-thrust and flight directors were engaged. During the approach, the crew noted that the aircraft was experiencing approximately 7 knots of tailwind, and as the approach progressed FDR data indicated the tailwind component increased to approximately 11 knots. As the airplane passed approximately 50 feet above touchdown the rate of descent was about 800 feet per minute (fpm). The captain stated he expected nothing more than a firm touchdown. The FO initiated the flare at about 45 feet. He stated that he attempted to arrest the sink rate with larger than normal aft stick deflection. During the flare, passing 20 feet above the runway, the automated ""retard"" call-out began a sequence of three annunciations. This automatic call-out is designed to remind the pilot to move the thrust levers to the idle detent. The thrust levers remained in the climb detent (CLB). During the flare, the airplane pitched up to about eight degrees nose up and airspeed decreased to about 132 knots. The airplane touched down on both main landing gear with a vertical load of about 1.56 G. At the time of initial touchdown, the thrust levers were still in CLB, and engine N1 increased from approximately 54% to 64% over 3 seconds. Radio altimeter values increased, indicating the aircraft then bounced. The FO held 16 degrees aft stick input (approximately full aft travel), and moved the thrust levers to idle during the bounce. Ground spoilers deployed (thrust lever position and wheel spin up logic was satisfied) and the airplane touched down a second time in an eleven degree nose up attitude, with FO still applying full aft stick input. At this point the captain began adding some nose down stick input however pitch attitude continued increasing to about 12.5 degrees nose up. The Airbus FCOM indicates that the max pitch up angle with gear compressed is 11.7 degrees. A ""dual input"" automatic call-out was recorded, indicating the system detected both pilots making stick inputs, and the sound of a loud bang was heard on the cockpit voice recorder. As the captain stick input moved further forward, in the airplane nose down direction, and the FO stick back pressure relaxed, the airplane began to pitch downward and about 3 seconds after the loud bang the nose wheel touched down. Thrust levers were then moved to the reverse position and autobraking began. The remainder of the roll out was normal. The aircraft experienced heavy abrasions, dents and perforations of the skin along the lower rear fuselage between frames 62 and 76. Additionally, the aft galley drain mast and two aircraft antennas were broken, and the APU air intake sustained damage. The rear pressure bulkhead damage was buckled and cracked. The lower segment of frame 70 was cracked and had heavy abrasions. Interior damage also consisted of minor deformation of frames, damage to stringers, frame clips, fasteners, floor support strut fittings and flange. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The first officerÂs excessive pitch-up of the airplane while landing with a tailwind, which resulted in a tailstrike following a bounced landing. Contributing to the bounced landing were a high descent rate and excessive thrust resulting from the first officerÂs delay in retarding the thrust levers to idle, thereby providing residual thrust and preventing spoiler deployment.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA09FA047 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  NTSB accident docket   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Denver International Airport, CO (DEN/KDEN); May 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Denver International Airport, CO (DEN/KDEN); May 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Denver International Airport, CO (DEN/KDEN); May 2009; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The seven crew members escaped unhurt. The airplane operated on a repositioning flight from Jeddah. During the flight, the captain discussed the use of manual spoilers during landing with the first officer. He further stated that; as he ""had only around 400 hours in the aircraft"" as a captain, he wanted to ""see the effect' of landing with manual spoilers. He further explained that the flight provided an opportunity to ""do it manually"" (use manual spoilers) as it was a repositioning flight and, the weather and dry runway conditions were ideal. As such, he discussed the procedure with the first officer and elected to land with the auto ground spoiler system unarmed. The flight was uneventful. During the approach to Riyadh the Landing Checklist was completed, which included the arming of the auto ground spoiler system for landing. After the Landing Checklist was completed, the captain disarmed the auto ground spoiler system with the intention of applying manual ground spoilers after landing. The auto braking system was also not armed prior to landing. The final approach and touchdown to runway 15 Left at Riyadh were uneventful. The touchdown airspeed was 135 knots calibrated air speed (CAS).  On touchdown, the captain manually extended the spoiler/speed brake lever, but did not latch it in the fully extended (EXT) position (fully aft and latched upwards). The captain then removed his right hand from the speed brake lever in order to deploy the thrust reversers. The first officer noted the movement of the spoiler/speed brake lever and called ""Spoilers Deployed"".  Since the spoiler/speed brake lever was not fully pulled aft and latched upwards, the lever automatically returned to the forward retracted (RET) position. This movement of the spoiler/speed brake lever was not noticed by the captain and the first officer. In response, the ground spoilers re-stowed before being fully deployed and, a speed brake/flap configuration (SPD BRK/FLP CONFIG) Level 1 Amber Alert occurred. This alert occurred as the aircraft was not yet fully weight on wheels (WOW) and the aircraft still sensed a flight condition with speed brakes deployed and flaps extended beyond six degrees. Six seconds after touchdown on the right main landing gear, the nose gear touched down and the aircraft transferred to a ground condition (WOW on nose gear and main wheel spin up). The SPD BRK/FLP CONFIG alert extinguished when the nose gear oleo actuated ground shift on landing.  After touchdown, the aircraft banked to the right and began to drift right of the runway centerline. In response, he applied left rudder, deployed the thrust reversers and applied left aileron. But this did not have any noticeable effect. The captain saw the approaching G4 taxiway exit and in an attempt to keep the aircraft from leaving the runway surface beyond the G4 taxiway exit, he decided to direct the aircraft towards the taxiway. He then applied a right rudder input which caused the aircraft to commence a rapid sweeping turn to the right towards the G4 taxiway exit. The aircraft left the runway at high speed, traversed the full width of the G4 taxiway, and exited the surface at its southern edge. The aircraft then entered a sand section and travelled the distance infield between the edge of the G4 taxiway and the adjacent section of taxiway GOLF. The left main landing gear collapsed during this time. The aircraft came to rest on taxiway GOLF. There was no post impact fire. Cause Related Findings 1. The Captain decided to land with manual ground spoilers when the auto ground spoiler system was fully operational. 2. The initiative by the Captain to conduct this improvised exercise contravened the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and the Flight Operations Policy Manual (FOPM). 3. The auto ground spoiler system was disarmed prior to landing. 4. The spoiler/speed brake lever was partially applied manually after landing. 5. The spoiler/speed brake lever was released before it was fully extended and latched. 6. The spoiler/speed brake lever automatically retracted as per design. 7. The ground spoilers never fully deployed. 8. The loss of lift and aircraft deceleration were greatly reduced by the lack of ground spoiler deployment. 9. Brakes were not used in an attempt to control or slowdown the aircraft. 10. The Captain applied a large right rudder input with the intention of directing the aircraft onto the G4 taxiway exit. 11. The aircraft exited the runway at high speed and was travelling too fast to successfully negotiate the right turn onto the G4 taxiway.Sources: Accident Report Saudi Arabian Airlines - Flight SVA 9061 MD 90-30, Registration HZ-APW King Khaled International Airport - Riyadh Kingdom of Saudi Arabia / GACA   Location  Images: photo (c) Konstantin von Wedelstaedt; Dubai Airport (DXB/OMDB); 12 February 2005 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft took off from Panama-Albrook Marcos A. Gelabert International Airport (PAC) at 11:13 UTC (06:13 am local). The crew reported experiencing strong vibrations in the nose gear, and after landing at CorazÃ³n de JesÃºs (CZJ), the crew noted the same condition. Upon landing at the next destination, CartÃ­, the aircraft veered uncontrollably to the right, impacting the right wing against some bushes and the left wing against the ground, turning the aircraft 90 degrees to the right. CONCLUSIONS. The accident occurred as a result of an unstable approach. Upon contact with the runway, the left main landing gear touched down, and in trying to correct with the steering at a speed higher than controllable, the reaction was an adverse yaw. This caused overcorrection, leading the aircraft off the runway to the right side and through the brush, impacting various trees and bushes.

The positioning flight was conducted using instrument flight rules and had departed Scottsdale Airport, AZ (SDL) at 15:03 MST. The pilot occupying the left seat was not injured and the pilot occupying the right seat received minor injuries.  In a statement to the NTSB provided by the Pilot-In-Command, upon arrival to TEX the weather was reported to be below minimums; the crew elected to hold over the Cones VOR and wait to see if weather conditions would improve. The crew was given instructions, by air traffic control, to hold as published and to expect further clearance (EFC) at 16:30. When the weather improved to a visibility of 4 miles and a ceiling of 2300 feet, the PIC requested a descent and approach to KTEX. At approximately 4 miles from the airport, the pilot acquired the airport environment but was not in position to land, so he called for a missed approach back to Cones VOR. The pilot then requested a second attempt to land stating that ""if we did not land, we would like to be sequenced to into KMTJ"" Montrose Regional Airport Montrose, CO, their alternate airport. On the second approach, both crew members stated that they had acquired the runway environment; however, they were still too high for a visual approach. The crew elected to do a 360-degree, right, descending turn, in order to get in a better position for landing. On completion of the turn, they again affirmed the runway environment and that they were aligned with the extended centerline of the runway. The airplane touched down and after full thrust reversers were deployed, the nose gear collapsed. The airplane began to slide in snow and came to a stop about mid-field, in an upright position. An initial FAA examination of the area indicated that the airplane had touched down about 20-feet to the right, of the runway. Additionally, the airplane's wings were torn from the fuselage and the tail section had separated just aft of the engines, during the contact with the ground. Weather reported at KTEX 10 minutes prior to the accident was winds 260 degrees at 8 knots, visibility of 3 miles, scattered clouds at 400 feet, broken clouds at 2300 feet, temperature of 6 degrees Celsius, dew point of 6 degrees Celsius, and altimeter setting 29.85 inches of mercury.

The aircraft began to drift to the left early in the landing roll and exited the runway surface about 4500 feet from the threshold. It travelled through a berm of plowed snow about 18"" deep for about 400-500 feet alongside the runway edge lights, during which time the nose wheel collapsed. The aircraft came to rest straddling the line of runway edge lights beyond the hold short line for the crossing runway 08R/26L. The occupants partially opened the main entrance door and evacuated the aircraft. ARFF crews arrived within two minutes. There were no injuries, fire or hazardous material spills.  The hourly METAR (1700 PST) recorded the wind at Vancouver as 140 degrees at 26 knots gusting to 33 knots with 5 sm visibility in light rain showers and temperature of +03 degrees C. A special observation issued at 17:22 (observation likely taken 10 -15 minutes before the issue time) recorded the wind as 120 degrees at 23 knots, gusting to 29 knots with 2.5 sm visibility in light rain and snow showers and temperature of +01 degree C. The runway surface was wet and snow had not been forecast; therefore, there was no runway surface condition (RSC) report available.Sources: CADORS Number: 2009P0015   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight was en route to Charlotte Douglas International Airport (CLT), North Carolina, USA, and departed LaGuardia runway 04 at 15:24. At this time, the first officer was the pilot flying (PF), and the captain was the pilot monitoring (PM). The takeoff and initial portion of the climb were uneventful. At 15:25:45, the LaGuardia ATCT local controller instructed the flight crew to contact the New York Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) LGA departure controller. The captain contacted the departure controller at 15:25:51, advising him that the airplane was at 700 feet and climbing to 5,000 feet. The controller then instructed the flight to climb to and maintain 15,000 feet, and the captain acknowledged the instruction.  At 15:27:10, the captain stated, ""birds."" One second later, at an altitude of 2,818 feet above ground level, the crew heard thumps and thuds followed by a shuddering sound. The aircraft had struck several Canada geese. Immediately after the bird encounter, both engines' fan and core (N1 and N2, respectively) speeds started to decelerate.  At 15:27:14, the first officer stated, ""uh oh,"" followed by the captain stating, ""we got one rol- both of 'em rolling back.""  The captain then stated he would start the APU and took over control of the airplane. At 15:27:28, the captain instructed the first officer to ""get the QRH [quick reference handbook] loss of thrust on both engines"", and reported the emergency situation to the LGA departure controller, stating, ""mayday mayday maydayÂthis is...Cactus fifteen thirty nine hit birds, we've lost thrust in both engines, we're turning back towards LaGuardia."" The LGA departure controller acknowledged the captain's statement and then instructed him to turn left heading 220Â°. The first officer began conducting Part 1 of the QRH ENG DUAL FAILURE checklist (Engine Dual Failure checklist), stating, ""if fuel remaining, engine mode selector, ignition,"" and the captain responded, ""ignition."" The first officer then stated, ""thrust levers confirm idle,"" and the captain responded, ""idle."" About 4 seconds later, the first officer stated, ""airspeed optimum relight. three hundred knots. we don't have that,"" and the captain responded, ""we don't."" At 15:28:05, the LGA departure controller asked the captain if he wanted to try to land on runway 13 at LGA if it was available, and the captain responded, ""we're unable. we may end up in the Hudson [River].""  The LGA departure controller cleared the flight for a left-hand traffic pattern for runway 31, but the captain responded, ""unable."" The controller then stated that runway 4 at LGA was available, and the captain responded, ""I'm not sure we can make any runway. Uh what's over to our right anything in New Jersey maybe Teterboro?"" The controller replied, ""ok yeah, off your right side is Teterboro Airport [TEB]."" Subsequently, the departure controller asked the captain if he wanted to try going to TEB, and the captain replied, ""yes."" At 15:29:11, the captain announced on the public address (PA) system, ""this is the Captain, brace for impact."" Meanwhile the pilots were working the checklist to restart the engines.  At 15:29:21, the LGA departure controller instructed the captain to turn right 280Â° for runway 1 at TEB. But the captain responded: ""we can't do it.""  The departure controller then asked the captain which runway at TEB he would like, and the captain responded, ""we're gonna be in the Hudson."" When it became clear that the engines would not restart, the captain requested to first officer to select the flaps.  At 15:30:43, the aircraft landed on the surface of the Hudson River. Within seconds after the ditching, the crewmembers and passengers initiated evacuation of the airplane. Subsequently, all of the occupants were evacuated from the airplane and rescued by area responders. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The ingestion of large birds into each engine, which resulted in an almost total loss of thrust in both engines and the subsequent ditching on the Hudson River. Contributing to the fuselage damage and resulting unavailability of the aft slide/rafts were (1) the Federal Aviation AdministrationÂs approval of ditching certification without determining whether pilots could attain the ditching parameters without engine thrust, (2) the lack of industry flight crew training and guidance on ditching techniques, and (3) the captainÂs resulting difficulty maintaining his intended airspeed on final approach due to the task saturation resulting from the emergency situation. Contributing to the survivability of the accident was (1) the decision-making of the flight crewmembers and their crew resource management during the accident sequence; (2) the fortuitous use of an airplane that was equipped for an extended overwater flight, including the availability of the forward slide/rafts, even though it was not required to be so equipped; (3) the performance of the cabin crewmembers while expediting the evacuation of the airplane; and (4) the proximity of the emergency responders to the accident site and their immediate and appropriate response to the accident.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NTSB/AAR-10/03 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   NTSB  Canada geese caused plane to ditch in Hudson (Sunday Independent, 18-1-2009)   Location  Images: photo (c) Janis Krums; Hudson River; 15 January 2009; (CC:by) photo (c) bmunch was bunglemunch; Hudson River; 16 January 2009; (CC:by-nc-sa) photo (c) bmunch was bunglemunch; Hudson River; 16 January 2009; (CC:by-nc-sa) photo (c) David Daoust; Jersey City, New Jersey; 17 January 2009; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) David Daoust; Jersey City, New Jersey; 17 January 2009; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) David Daoust; Jersey City, New Jersey; 17 January 2009; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) David Daoust; Jersey City, New Jersey; 18 January 2009; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) David Daoust; Jersey City, New Jersey; 18 January 2009; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) Joseph Hoetzl; Jersey City, New Jersey; 25 January 2009; (CC:by-nc) photo (c) EeSLee; Jersey City, New Jersey; 31 January 2009; (CC:by) photo (c) www.quintanomedia.com; Little Ferry, New Jersey; 31 January 2009; (CC:by) photo (c) NTSB; Jersey City, New Jersey; 18 January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Jersey City, New Jersey; January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Jersey City, New Jersey; January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Jersey City, New Jersey; January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Jersey City, New Jersey; January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Jersey City, New Jersey; January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Jersey City, New Jersey; January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Jersey City, New Jersey; January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Jersey City, New Jersey; January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Jersey City, New Jersey; January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Miami International Airport, FL (MIA/KMIA); March 2001 photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Phoenix-Sky Harbor International Airport, AZ (PHX/KPHX); October 2006 photo (c) Sergio Cardona; New York-La Guardia Airport, NY (LGA/KLGA); 13 January 2009 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates19-Feb-2024 18:44 ASN Updated [Damage, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

On arrival in the Island Lake area, the crew commenced an instrument approach to runway 12. During the approach, the aircraft descended and the crew carried out a missed approach. During the missed approach, the aircraft struck a tree. The crew continued the missed approach and returned for a landing at Island Lake without further incident. No injuries were reported. The aircraft sustained damage to the wing leading edge and underside, and to its landing gear doors. FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1. The crew conducted an Area Navigation (RNAV) approach for which they were not trained, with an aircraft that was not properly equipped nor approved for such purpose. 2. The aircraft descended 300 feet below the minimum descent altitude (MDA) as a result of a number of lapses, errors and adaptations which, when combined, resulted in the mismanaged approach. 3. The aural warning on the aircraft's altitude alerter had been silenced prior to the approach, which precluded it from alerting the crew when the aircraft descended below minimum descent altitude. 4. The SkyNorth standard operating procedures for conducting a non-precision approach were not followed, which resulted in the aircraft descending below the minimum descent altitude. During the ensuing missed approach, the aircraft struck trees.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A09C0012 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  2 July 1998 C-GNAA LaLoche Airways 0 Patuanak, SK sub Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Weather at Lubbock was poor with an overcast at 500 feet, freezing drizzle and mist. The aircraft encountered icing conditions while en route to Lubbock. And although the airplane accumulated some ice during the flight that degraded its performance, the NTSB determined that the aircraft could have landed safely had the airspeed been maintained.  During the approach to Lubbock runway 17R, at about 1400 feet above the ground and about 90 seconds from the runway, the captain indicated a flight control problem saying, ""We have no flaps."" Although the crewmembers had been trained to perform a go-around and refer to a checklist if a flap problem occurred during an approach, the captain chose to continue the approach as he attempted to troubleshoot the flap anomaly while the first officer flew the plane. Neither flight crewmember adequately monitored the airspeed, which decayed to the extent that the stick shaker activated, which warned of an impending aerodynamic stall.  The captain continued the unstabilized approach even though he received additional stick shaker activations and an aural ""pull up"" warning from the terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS). At that point, the plane was descending at a rate of over 2,000 ft per minute.  Although procedures for responding to either the stick shaker or the TAWS warning require the immediate application of maximum engine power, the captain did not apply maximum power until 17 seconds after the TAWS warning. Seconds after maximum power was applied, the airplane entered an aerodynamic stall and crashed. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the flight crew's failure to monitor and maintain a minimum safe airspeed while executing an instrument approach in icing conditions, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall at low altitude. Contributing to the accident were 1) the flight crew's failure to follow published standard operating procedures in response to a flap anomaly, 2) the captain's decision to continue with the unstabilized approach, 3) the flight crew's poor crew resource management, and 4) fatigue due to the time of day in which the accident occurred and a cumulative sleep debt, which likely impaired the captain's performance.""METAR: 09:53 UTC / 03:53 local time: KLBB 270953Z 01014KT 3SM -FZDZ BR OVC005 M08/M09 A3013 RMK AO2 PRESRR SLP227 P0000 T10781094=wind at 10 degrees, 14 kts, visibility 3 miles in mist and freezing drizzle, ceiling 500 feet overcast, temperature -7.8 deg C, dewpoint -9.4 deg C10:53 UTC / 04:53 local time: KLBB 271053Z 02011G18KT 2SM -FZDZ BR OVC005 M08/M09 A3013 RMK AO2 CIG 004V009 SLP228 P0000 T10781094=wind at 20 degrees, 11 kts gusting to 18 kts, visibility 2 miles in mist and freezing drizzle, ceiling 500 feet overcast, temperature -7.8 deg C, dewpoint -9.4 deg CAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NTSB/AAR-11-02 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   NTSB History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  21 January 1998 N15827 Continental Express 0 Hartford-Bradley International Airport, CT (BDL) sub Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport, TX (LBB/KLBB); January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport, TX (LBB/KLBB); January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport, TX (LBB/KLBB); January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport, TX (LBB/KLBB); January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport, TX (LBB/KLBB); January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport, TX (LBB/KLBB); January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Houston-Intercontinental Airport, TX (IAH/KIAH); February 1993 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

After the nose ski cleared the snow, the left wing rose and the aircraft veered to the right and the captain, who was the pilot flying, continued the takeoff. The right ski, however, was still in contact with the snow. The aircraft became airborne briefly as it cleared a deep gully to the right of the runway. The aircraft remained in a steep right bank and the right wing contacted the snow-covered ground. The aircraft flew through a chain link fence and crashed into trees surrounding the airport. The five passengers and two crewmembers evacuated the aircraft with minor injuries. There was a small fire near the right engine exhaust that was immediately extinguished by the crew. FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1. Contamination on the wings of the aircraft was not fully removed before take-off. It is likely that asymmetric contamination of the wings created a lift differential and a loss of lateral control. 2. Although the operator was not authorized for short take-off and landing (STOL) take-off on this aircraft, the crew conducted a STOL take-off, which reduced the aircraft's safety margin relative to its stalling speed and minimum control speed. 3. As a result of the loss of lateral control, the slow STOL take-off speed, and the manipulation of the flaps, the aircraft did not remain airborne and veered right, colliding with obstacles beside the ski strip. FINDINGS AS TO RISK 1. The out of phase task requirements regarding the engine vibration isolator assembly, as listed in the operator's maintenance schedule approval, results in a less than thorough inspection requirement, increasing the likelihood of fatigue cracks remaining undetected. 2. The right engine inboard and top engine mounts had pre-existing fatigue cracks, increasing the risk of catastrophic failure. OTHER FINDINGS 1. The cockpit voice recorder (CVR) contained audio of a previous flight and was not in operation during the occurrence flight. Minimum equipment list (MEL) procedures for logbook entries and placarding were not followed. 2. The Transwest Air Limited safety management system (SMS) did not identify deviations from standard operating procedures.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A09C0017 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources: CADORS Number: 2009C0305 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  19 November 1969 VH-TGS TAA-Trans Australia Airlines 0 Marawaka sub 5 March 2006 C-FCCE Transwest Air 0 La Ronge Airport (CYVC), SK sub Location  Images: photo (c) TSB; La Ronge Airport, SK (YVC/CYVC); 04 February 2009 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The certified flight instructor (CFI) and the student pilot were not injured; the airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and wings from impact forces. The student pilot was performing the takeoff. During the takeoff roll on runway 30, the airplane began to drift to the right, and the student applied left rudder to correct for the drift. The CFI advanced the right throttle during the ground roll in an attempt to counteract the right yaw. The tail wheel came off the ground about 80 knots, and the airplane swerved to the right. The CFI applied left rudder in an attempt to stop the yaw and drift. As the airplane was about to depart the runway, the pilots did not reduce the throttles or apply brakes as they felt that it would be safer to attempt to get airborne. The airplane slowed as it departed the runway surface. It collided with a series of berms, which sheared off the left landing gear and left engine. The right landing gear collapsed, and the airplane came to rest in a nose down attitude. The operator stated that the student pilot inadvertently set the rudder trim to the full right position when he adjusted the rudder pedals during the prestart checks. The rudder trim was in the full right position for the takeoff, and found in the same position upon post accident inspection. The DC-3 involved was a turbine conversion and highly modified with a belly radar pod and chin FLIR turret. It was formerly operated by the South African Air Force as a maritime patrol aircraft.

SAS Braathens flight 414 from Oslo Airport Gardermoen (ENGM) was approaching TromsÃ¸. During the descent, the fasten seatbelt sign was switched on at 15,000 ft in accordance with current company procedures. The cabin crew cleared and prepared the cabin. The aeroplane had descended to about 8 000 ft when it encountered clear airturbulence. The turbulence only lasted for a few seconds. One of the cabin crew at the back of the cabin had not had time to buckle up and lost her footing. She fell hard and broke her left ankle. The flight crew radioed air traffic control and informed them of the turbulence. It turned out that a warning had been issued for localised strong turbulence below 8,000 ft in the area in question (SIGMET). However, the alert was issued after the flight crew of SAS414 had planned their flight, and they had not received this information en route to TromsÃ¸. Normally, such information would have been communicated both by radio and via the aircraft's data link (Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System, ACARS). On the day in question, however, the ACARS system was faulty, so no SIGMET was sent out to any of the company's aircraft.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIBN Report number: 2009/17 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: AIBN Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates22-May-2024 18:36 ASN Added Corrections or additions? ...

Both pilots and 22 passengers were killed in the accident. Four passengers survived. The airplane had departed the Amazon city of Coari (CIZ) at 12:40 on a domestic flight to Manaus (MAO). About 13:10, while at FL115, the no. 1 engine flamed out. At 13:15 the crew made a contact with the Area Control Centre (ACC-AZ) reporting on descent for Manaus with twenty persons on board. In reality there were 28 occupants. The ACC controller instructed the crew to contact Manaus Approach Control. Subsequently, the pilot informed Manaus Approach that they would return to Coari. Contact was lost and at 13:24 radar contact was lost. The airplane came down in Rio Manacapuru. The airplane involved, an EMB-110P1, has a (certificated) maximum number of passenger seats of nineteen. On the accident flight 26 passengers had boarded the flight, including eight small children. Maximum takeoff weight for an EMB-110P1 is 5670 kg. The actual takeoff weight of the accident aircraft was 6414 kg. Contributing Factors 1 Human Factor 1.1 Medical Aspect It did not. 1.2 Psychological Aspect 1.2.1 Individual information 1.2.1.1 - Attitude - undetermined It is possible that the pilot's stated experience in this type of mission has influenced his permissive attitude towards situations contrary to what was predicted, raising his confidence in the ability to fulfill the mission, thus disregarding the risks involved. 1.2.1.2 - Culture of the working group - contributed There were no mass pilots conducting standardized procedures, such as briefing before and after each mission. They also showed an attitude of acceptance regarding the pilot's behavior not to carry out the intended procedures. Thus, attitudes were translated into informal rules of behavior in situations related to professional activity and safety. 1.2.2 Organizational Information 1.2.2.1 - Characteristics of the task - undetermined It is possible that the co-pilot took most of the flight preparation tasks in Coari, since it was customary for this to happen on missions with this commander. This may have interfered with the tasks under their responsibility, such as checking the number of people on board and giving passengers guidance on normal and emergency procedures. In addition, it is possible that the division of tasks relating to emergency procedures has been compromised, considering that some switches have been found in positions contrary to those recommended by the operations manual. 1.2.2.2 - Organizational Culture - contributed The company culture was reported as being focused on operational safety, however, in practice, what could be verified did not strengthen safe behaviors. Management did not supervise attitudes and did not control compliance with the procedures covered in the Operations Manual and in company training. There was a small participation of its crew members in prevention activities programmed by the company itself. 1.2.2.3 - Training, training and training - contributed There was no periodicity in training for emergency procedures. Despite the great experience of the commander, the lack of emergency training was present. Training of normal procedures, such as passing proper instructions to passengers, has also not been verified. 1.2.2.4 - Organization of work - contributed The procedures foreseen and established in the company's Operations Manual for operational safety were not applied, since the crew stopped transmitting the verbal instructions to the passengers, before takeoff and in the emergency situation. The crew made it possible to take off with excess weight and passengers, stopped communicating the emergency situation to the air traffic control agencies and allowed passengers to drink alcohol during the flight, facts that prove the accomplishment of the activities in an improvised way. 1.2.3 - Organizational processes - contributed 1.2.3.1 - Support systems - contributed Through the policy of granting total autonomy to the commander, the company was unaware of the decisions which, consequently, could affect the safety of the flight, as happened in relation to the refueling of the aircraft with less fuel And embark passengers in excess, thus demonstrating that there was no monitoring of activities in the operational scope. 1.2.3.10 - Other - contributed The blockage in the flow of information when the crew omitted information to Air Traffic Control and the lack of information to the passengers, during all the phases of the mission, made the assistance difficult in the face of the situation experienced, because if they had been The consequences could have been minimized. 1.3 Operational Aspect 1.3.1 Maintenance of the aircraft - contributed If the company's maintenance sector had performed the Oil Fuel Heater temperature check, it probably could have been verified that the thermal element had failed, which would lead to the replacement of the assembly, as recommended by the engine manufacturer's maintenance manual. It can not be said that such a failure was decisive for the engine failure, but evidenceAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: CENIPA Report number: A-018/CENIPA/2010 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: AviÃ£o com 24 pessoas cai em rio do Amazonas, 4 sobrevivem (O Globo, 7-2-2009)  Manaus AerotÃ¡xi  ForÃ§a AÃ©rea Brasileira   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Both crew members were killed. The airplane was chartered to carry out a medical flight to Cagliari to pick up a patient for transplant surgery at Bologna. But first the jet had to be flown from its home base at Roma-Ciampino Airport to Bologna Airport (BLQ) to pick up a medical team. At 05:54, shortly before departed, Ciampino Tower cleared flight 301 for a PEMAR 5 ALFA Standard Instrument Departure. Following a right hand turn after takeoff from runway 15, the jet was to fly towards the coastline at a heading of approx 240Â°. The flight took off from runway 15 at 06:00. After contacting the Roma Radar controller, the crew were received clearance to ""fly direct to Bolsena, climb level 240, no speed restriction."" This meant that the crew could continue the right hand turn after takeoff to a heading of 336Â° for a direct course to Bolsena. About half way the turn was discontinued. The airplane climbed in a shallow left hand turn which progressively became steeper. Altitude was lost and the airplane struck terrain nose down. CAUSE (translated from Italian report): The cause of the accident was due to an impact with the ground resulting from the loss of control of the aircraft by the captain, who was also the PF. It appears very likely that during the initial phase inadequate attention was replaced by a phase of spatial disorientation, resulting in a loss of situational awareness, which prompted an inadquate intervention on the flight controls by the PF, resulting in total loss of control of the aircraft (having accentuated the tilt to the left wing, instead of leveling the aircraft). It is reasonable to assume that the PF, based on the conviction of being in a right turn for Bolsena in IMC night conditions, misinterpreted the unusual turn, using the controls in order to accentuate the bank angle to the left, drastically reducing the vertical component of lift. This turn has consequently caused the aircraft to assume an attitude of increasing bank, a condition that has been aggravated by the continued application on the controls of a positive load factor in order to stop the sudden loss of altitude, without first leveling the wings. Or the aircraft is stabilized in a pronounced downward spiral to the left. The first officer (PNF), engaged in the management of navigation equipment, has created the unusual turn of the aircraft in conjunction with the commander (PF). Nevertheless, the considerable gradient of experience on the airplane and hierarchy within the organization between the captain and the first officer has probably prevented him to intervene in a more directive or authoritative way in the recovery phase of the situation. Also contributing to the outcome of the event was the lack of detail in the definition of the duties of the crew procedures and inadequate adherence to the basic principles of CRM/MCC, with reference to the monitoring and statement of the navigation modes active, navigation procedures and in particular to the lack of requests for inclusion of turns and routes, the deficiency in the performance of controls and optimization of automation that can lighten the workload in a time unfavorable from the point of view of the circadian rhythm and IMC night. In this respect, it seems fitting to remember the problem of spatial disorientation, although known and studied for decades, is still relevant, and that the only way to counter it is the application of proper use of instruments in compliance with the basic principles of CRM/MCC, which should  be part of the normal operating procedures of an operator. This is especially true when working outside of normal circadian rhythms, when it is most easily seen a slowing of cognitive processes.METAR: 05:15 UTC / 06:15 local time: LIRA 070515Z 14018KT 9999 -RA FEW018 SCT030 BKN070 13/10 Q0992=wind 140 degrees at 18kts, light rain, few clouds 1,800 ft., scattered clouds 3,000 ft., broken clouds 7,000 ft., temperature 13Â°C, dew point 10Â°C, 992 mb05:45 UTC / 06:45 local time: LIRA 070545Z 16018KT 8000 -RA FEW014 SCT025 BKN070 13/11 Q0992=wind 160 degrees at 18kts, light rain, few clouds 1,400 ft., scattered clouds 2,500 ft., broken clouds 7,000 ft., temperature 13Â°C, dew point 11Â°C, 992 mbAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: ANSV Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: ANSV   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

En route the crew received information that it there was light snowfall at CDG. During the approach briefing the crew planned an ILS approach to runway 26L at 146 kt (Vref + 8 kt), full flaps, and autobrakes at medium. At 23:22 UTC (00:23 local time) the captain announced that the runway was in sight, as the aircraft was passes through a height of 240 feet. He then disconnected the autopilot. The aircraft was above the glideslope as the descent towards the runway was continued. After flying over the runway threshold at 85 ft, the captain began flaring at 40 ft. The aircraft touched down approximately 1050 m from the 26L threshold. Ground speed was 139 kt. With reversers selected at idle the crew noted that deceleration was not as expected. The captain then selected maximum reverse and began applying manual braking. At the end of the runway the captain steered the plane onto taxiway V1. At a ground speed of 41 knots the aircraft ran off the taxiway, coming to rest after 20 m. The left main gear and nose gear were damaged and deemed irreparable. The right main gear and 2 engine were also damaged. Causes of the accident: The accident was due to the continuation of landing when it touched down long and it was found that external conditions were more degraded than those previously reported to the crew. The following have contributed to the occurrence of this accident: - contamination of runway 08R/26L and degradation of the surface state (Rubber coating and deterioration of the surface) between 900 m and 300 m from THR 08R; - the erroneous determination of the runway 08R/26L conditions due to inadequate organization ground operations, monitoring the status of the platform in case of snow and maintenance of runways; - misinformation about the condition of the track, transmitted to the crew does not permit him to adopt the necessary measures; - non-use of thrust reversers.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Report number: f-aj090208 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Investigation revealed that the forward yoke pintle on the right main landing gear fitted to SX-SKY failed on landing. The landing gear had flown 23,940 cycles since new and had been overhauled 148 landings prior to the accident. The aircraft landing weight was calculated to be 14,870 lb (6745 kg), which was within the maximum limit of 14,900 lb (6759 kg), and the FDR recorded a normal acceleration on landing of 1.79 g. A review of the data on the FDR identified two possible heavy landings of 2.5 g and 2.87 g that had occurred 5 and 27 landings prior to the accident. Probable Causes: Landing gear cylinder failure because of ductile overload resulting from a ÂheavyÂ landing made by the aircraft.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIASB  Report number: Report no 08/2009 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources: airliners.gr  Scramble 358  AAIB Bulletin: 10/2012   Location  Images: photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Rhodes/Paradisi-Diagoras Airport (RHO/LGRP); July 2006 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft touched down left of centreline with the right wing first, then with right main gear. The aircraft drifted to the left and touched with the left wing a snow wall at the runway edge. The aircraft nose hit the snow wall frontally. The aircraft turned to the left and broke into two parts. CAUSES: The accident is attributable to the fact that the crew wanted to make a landing with inadequate visual references from an unfavourable initial position and as a result, after touchdown the aircraft collided with a snowbank running along the runway. The following factors contributed to the accident: - The rapidly changing weather conditions on the mountain aerodrome of Samedan were misjudged by the crew. - A coordinated crew working method in terms of crew resource management was missing. - The deactivation of the EGPWS, which meant that acoustic messages concerning the aircraftÂs height above ground and bank angle were no longer available in the final phase of the approach up to the first contact with the runway. - A snowbank up to four metres high ran along the edge of the runway.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BFU Switz.

The crash site was approximately 5 nautical miles northeast of the airport in Clarence Center, New York, and mostly confined to one residential house (6038 Long St, Clarence) . The four flight crew and 45 passengers were fatally injured and the aircraft was destroyed by impact forces and post crash fire. There was one ground fatality. Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.  Flight CJC3407 departed Newark-Liberty International Airport, NJ (EWR) at 21:20 on a domestic flight to Buffalo Airport, NY (BUF). At 22:15:14 the Buffalo Approach controller cleared the flight for an ILS approach to runway 23: ""Colgan thirty four zero seven three miles from klump turn left heading two six zero maintain two thousand three hundred till established localizer clear i l s approach runway two three."" The flight acknowledged that clearance. At 22:16:02, the engine power levers were reduced to flight idle. At that time Buffalo Approach instructed the crew to contact Buffalo Tower. The crew extended the landing gear and the auto flight system captured the ILS 23 localizer. The captain then moved the engine conditions levers forward to the maximum RPM position as the copilot acknowledged the instructions to Buffalo Tower.  At 22:16:28 the crew moved the flaps to 10Â°, and two seconds later the stall warning stick shaker activated. The autopilot disconnected at about the same time that the stick shaker activated. The crew added power to approximately 75% torque. The airplane began a sharp pitch up motion, accompanied by a left roll, followed by a right roll, during which the stick pusher activated. During this time, the indicated airspeed continued to decrease to less than 100 kts. Eight seconds after the flaps had been selected to 10Â°, and at an airspeed of less than 110 kts, the crew retracted the flaps. Sixteen seconds later the flaps were fully retracted. Following further pitch and roll excursions the airplane pitched down and entered a steep descent from which it did not recover. The airplane impacted a residential house and was destroyed. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the captainÂs inappropriate response to the activation of the stick shaker, which led to an aerodynamic stall from which the airplane did not recover. Contributing to the accident were (1) the flight crewÂs failure to monitor airspeed in relation to the rising position of the low-speed cue, (2) the flight crewÂs failure to adhere to sterile cockpit procedures, (3) the captainÂs failure to effectively manage the flight, and (4) Colgan AirÂs inadequate procedures for airspeed selection and management during approaches in icing conditions.""METAR: 02:54 UTC / 21:54 local time: KBUF 130254Z 24015G22KT 3SM -SN BR FEW011 BKN021 OVC027 01/M01 A2979 RMK AO2  SLP097 P0001 60004 T00061006 51015=Wind 240 degrees at 15 kts, gusting to 22kts; light snow, mist with a visibility of 3 miles; few clouds 1,100 ft.; broken clouds 2,100 ft.; overcast 2,700 ft.

The 71 occupants evacuated the aircraft using emergency slides.  The nose landing gear of flight BA8456 collapsed after touchdown at London City Airport (LCY) runway 28.  BBC News reported on May 25, 2009 that British Airways had written off the airplane. CONCLUSIONS: Following a normal touchdown, the fracture of the nose landing gear main fitting allowed the nose gear to collapse rearwards and penetrate the lower fuselage, causing significant damage to the equipment bay and the battery to become disconnected. The penetration of the fuselage allowed smoke and fumes produced by the consequent release of hydraulic fluid to enter the cockpit and passenger cabin. With the battery disconnected and after the engines were shut down, all power to the aircraft PA systems was lost and the remote cockpit door release mechanism became inoperative. No pre-accident defects were identified with the manual cockpit door release mechanism or the PA system. The nose landing gear main fitting failed following the formation of multiple fatigue cracks within the upper section of the inner bore, originating at the base of machining grooves in the bore surface. These had formed because the improved surface finish, introduced by SB 146-32-150, had not been properly embodied at previous overhaul by Messier Services Inc, despite their overhaul records showing its incorporation. The operator had been in full compliance with the Service Bulletin relating to regular inspection of the main fitting, and embodiment of SB 146-32-150 at overhaul removed the requirement for these inspections by the operator.Sources: BA jobs go after plane write-off (BBC, 25 May 2009)  BA jet in airport 'hard landing' (BBC, 14 February 2009)   Location  Images: photo (c) AAIB; London City Airport (LCY/EGLC); February 2009 photo (c) Harro Ranter; Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS/EHAM); 22 February 2002; (CC:by-nc-nd) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The captain stated that while en route to Kotzebue, the weather at the airport dropped below VFR minimums, and he received a special VFR clearance. He said that the local area and runway were covered with snow, but when he turned final he could see the airport beacon and associated buildings. He said about 200 feet above the ground on approach he lost sight of the runway environment, and asked the first officer if he could see anything. When the first officer said no, and reported their altitude at 50 feet agl, the captain said he initiated a go-around, but the airplane impacted the terrain short of the runway. The captain reported that there were no known mechanical problems with the airplane or its instruments prior to the accident. The Director of Operations for the operator said the airplane sustained structural damage to the fuselage near the left main landing gear.  An Federal Aviation Administration flight service specialist at the airport said the visibility had been about 1-1/4 miles, but dropped to 1/4-mile rapidly during the time of the approach. Weather observations taken at the airport showed that about 3 minutes before the accident, the visibility was 1 mile in light snow and blowing snow, wind as 160 degrees at 28 knots gusting to 32. About 1 minute before the accident, the visibility was reported as 1/4-mile in light snow and blowing snow, wind from 160 degrees at 33 knots gusting to 36. About 3 minutes after the accident, the visibility remained at 1/4-mile in light snow and blowing snow, and the wind was reported as 170 degrees at 35 knots with gusts to 42.

The aircraft was previously owned by the Moldovian operator Aeriantur-M Airlines as ER-AXI. The airline ceased operations in January 2007 following an accident with one of its aircraft. It was subsequently sold to a private person and underwent C-check maintenance in the United Arab Emirates between March and May 2007. Meanwhile, in April. the Certificate of Airworthiness expired. There was information that the aircraft kept on flying in D.R. Congo. In 2008 Antonov was contacted to perform additional maintenance on the aircraft, which resulted in an agreement and a planned ferry flight in 2009. The aircraft certificate of temporary register in the state of Sao Tome as S9-SVN valid from 21 January 2009 until 20 February. A special flight permit was issued for a ferry flight valid till 20 February between Kisangani Airport, D.R. Congo Nikolaev Airport, Ukraine. The permit and the registration were for Aerolift Company Limited. The aircraft departed Kisangani and proceeded to Entebbe Airport, Uganda, and Luxor Airport in Egypt. After refuelling, the engines were started and the flight was cleared to taxi to runway 02 for departure. At 04:18 local time the aircraft began the takeoff roll. The aircraft failed to become airborne and continued rolling past the end of the runway into the sand. It crossed a service road and crashed into buildings in a military zone 500 meters from the runway end. After the accident numerous safety violations were discovered. The service life of the aircraft had expired and the Sao Tome authorities did not inspect the aircraft prior to issuing a temporary Certificate of Airworthiness and ferry permit.  The engines and propellers had reprinted numbers plates without documentation to confirm their service life or airworthiness. Additionally, the engines on the aircraft were of different types (AI-20M and AI-20K). The crew did not have enough time for rest. The decision of the crew to fly was influenced by the fact that the temporary certificate of airworthiness expired on 20 February, 2009. PROBABLE CAUSES OF THE ACCIDENT: - Lack of available thrust which corresponded to the power of only two engines running during take off run - Lack of authorized maintenance of the aircraft. - The uncoordinated crew actions in the critical situation (both pilots had previously flown as captains). The lack of coordination is confirmed by the braking trails left by the main landing gear at the end of RWY -02, based on FCOM instructions, and in case of rejected takeoff attempt, the crew had to set the throttles to idle, lower the nose gear to reach the runway and then use the propellers for braking (releasing them from the stops). Also, to reduce the roll and to maintain the direction they were to use the nose wheel steering and wheel brakes as well as emergency braking if needed. Actually the crew did neither of the above procedures, except using the main wheel brakes.METAR: 02:00 UTC / 04:00 local time: HELX 200200Z 17002KT CAVOK 14/01 Q1014 NOSIG=Wind 170 degrees, 2 kts, Ceiling unlimited, Sky clear, Temperature 14Â°C, Dewpoint 1Â°CAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: ECAA Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: Reuters  ukranews.com  ITAR-TASS   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane took off at 12:47 local time. About one minute after takeoff the crew reported that they were returning to the aerodrome of departure due to loss of engine power. The power was then lost almost completely, forcing the crew to carry out a forced landing in an agricultural field. This field contained deep slots, perpendicular to the direction of flight. On touchdown the left hand landing gear collapsed, along with the left hand wings. The reason for the loss of engine power in flight, most likely, was a reduction in the filing of the gasoline due to clogging of fuel filters. The appearance, structure and nature of the impurities found in the fuel on the aircraft were not characteristic of impurities accumulated in the fuel supply system in normal operating conditions.

After takeoff, during the landing gear up procedure, the pilot noted one red light illuminate (nose gear) on the landing gear panel. During the investigation the pilots reported that they recycled the landing gear and the subsequent cockpit indication was that the landing gear was in the up and locked position. The pilots continued the flight to the planned destination Hang Nadim Aiport, Batam. During final approach at Batam, the pilots noted that the red light nose gear indicator was illuminated.

When approximately one mile from the runway, the copilot decided to change the flight path to line up with the correct runway.  The pilot-in-command (PIC) reported that when the copilot rolled out on final approach, the airplane drifted to the right of the runway centerline.  The copilot began to correct the alignment; however, the airplane continued to drift right.  At 10 feet above the runway, the PIC instructed the co-pilot to perform a go-around.  The PIC stated that the right wing dropped and the right main tires settled on the runway during the go-around.  The copilot reported that the turn onto final approach was normal and that the airplane drifted slightly right of centerline when they crossed the airport boundary. The copilot reported that the winds were gusting out of the east (left side) during the landing.  The tower informed the flight crew that there was a white mist coming from their right tip tank.  Upon inspection the flight crew noticed fuel leaking from the right wing tip tank.  The airplane remained in the traffic pattern and then completed an uneventful landing.  The airplane sustained substantial damage to the outboard portion of the right wing.  Local winds reported 11 minutes prior to the accident were from 150 degrees at 6 knots, and 49 minutes after the accident the local winds were reported as being from 160 degrees at 5 knots.

Flight TK1951 departed Istanbul-AtatÃ¼rk International Airport (IST) for a flight to Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS), The Netherlands. The flight crew consisted of three pilots: a line training captain who occupied the left seat, a first officer under line training in the right seat and an additional first officer who occupied the flight deck jump seat. The first officer under line training was the pilot flying. The en route part of the flight was uneventful. The flight was descending for Schiphol and passed overhead Flevoland at about 8500 ft. At that time the aural landing gear warning sounded. The aircraft continued and was then directed by Air Traffic Control towards runway 18R for an ILS approach and landing. The standard procedure for runway 18R prescribes that the aircraft is lined up at least 8 NM from the runway threshold at an altitude of 2000 feet. The glidepath is then approached and intercepted from below. Lining up at a distance between 5 and 8 NM is allowed when permitted by ATC.  Flight 1951 was vectored for a line up at approximately 6 NM at an altitude of 2000 feet. The glide slope was now approached from above. The crew performed the approach with one of the two autopilot and autothrottle engaged.  The landing gear was selected down and flaps 15 were set. While descending through 1950 feet, the radio altimeter value suddenly changed to -8 feet. And again the aural landing gear warning sounded. This could be seen on the captainÂs (left-hand) primary flight display. The first officerÂs (right-hand) primary flight display, by contrast, indicated the correct height, as provided by the right-hand system. The left hand radio altimeter system, however, categorised the erroneous altitude reading as a correct one, and did not record any error. In turn, this meant that it was the erroneous altitude reading that was used by various aircraft systems, including the autothrottle. The crew were unaware of this, and could not have known about it. The manuals for use during the flight did not contain any procedures for errors in the radio altimeter system. In addition, the training that the pilots had undergone did not include any detailed system information that would have allowed them to understand the significance of the problem. When the aircraft started to follow the glidepath because of the incorrect altitude reading, the autothrottle moved into the Âretard flareÂ mode. This mode is normally only activated in the final phase of the landing, below 27 feet. This was possible because the other preconditions had also been met, including flaps at (minimum) position 15. The thrust from both engines was accordingly reduced to a minimum value (approach idle). This mode was shown on the primary flight displays as ÂRETARDÂ. However, the right-hand autopilot, which was activated, was receiving the correct altitude from the right-hand radio altimeter system. Thus the autopilot attempted to keep the aircraft flying on the glide path for as long as possible. This meant that the aircraftÂs nose continued to rise, creating an increasing angle of attack of the wings. This was necessary in order to maintain the same lift as the airspeed reduced. In the first instance, the pilotsÂ only indication that the autothrottle would no longer maintain the pre-selected speed of 144 knots was the RETARD display. When the speed fell below this value at a height of 750 feet, they would have been able to see this on the airspeed indicator on the primary flight displays. When subsequently, the airspeed reached 126 knots, the frame of the airspeed indicator also changed colour and started to flash. The artificial horizon also showed that the nose attitude of the aircraft was becoming far too high. The cockpit crew did not respond to these indications and warnings. The reduction in speed and excessively high pitch attitude of the aircraft were not recognised until the approach to stall warning (stick shaker) went off at an altitude of 460 feet.  The first officer responded immediately to the stick shaker by pushing the control column forward and also pushing the throttle levers forward. The captain however, also responded to the stick shaker commencing by taking over control. Assumingly the result of this was that the first officerÂs selection of thrust was interrupted. The result of this was that the autothrottle, which was not yet switched off, immediately pulled the throttle levers back again to the position where the engines were not providing any significant thrust. Once the captain had taken over control, the autothrottle was disconnected, but no thrust was selected at that point. Nine seconds after the commencement of the first approach to stall warning, the throttle levers were pushed fully forward, but at that point the aircraft had already stalled and the height remaining, of about 350 feet, was insufficient for a recovery. According to the last recorded data of the digital flight data recorder the aircraft was in a 22Â° ANU and 10Â° Left Wing Down (LWD) position at the moment of impact. The airplane impacted farmland. The horizontal stabilizer and both main landing gear legs were separated from the aircraft and located near the initial impact point. The left and right engines had detached from the aircraft. The aft fuselage, with vertical stabilizer, was broken circumferentially forward of the aft passenger doors and had sustained significant damage. The fuselage had ruptured at the right side forward of the wings. The forward fuselage section, which contained the cockpit and seat rows 1 to 7, had been significantly disrupted. The rear fuselage section was broken circumferentially around row 28. The Dutch Safety Board has reached the following main conclusion: During the accident flight, while executing the approach by means of the instrument landing system with the right autopilot engaged, the left radio altimeter system showed an incorrect height of -8 feet on the left primary flight display. This incorrect value of -8 feet resulted in activation of the Âretard flareÂ mode of the autothrottle, whereby the thrust of both engines was reduced to a minimal value (approach idle) in preparation for the last phase of the landing. Due to the approach heading and altitude provided to the crew by air traffic control, the localizer signal was intercepted at 5.5 NM from the runway threshold with the result that the glide slope had to be intercepted from above. This obscured the fact that the autothrottle had entered the retard flare mode. In addition, it increased the crewÂs workload. When the aircraft passed 1000 feet height, the approach was not stabilised so the crew should have initiated a go around. The right autopilot (using data from the right radio altimeter) followed the glide slope signal. As the airspeed continued to drop, the aircraftÂs pitch attitude kept increasing. The crew failed to recognise the airspeed decay and the pitch increase until the moment the stick shaker was activated. Subsequently the approach to stall recovery procedure was not executed properly, causing the aircraft to stall and crash.METAR: 09:25 UTC / 10:25 local time: EHAM 250925Z 20010KT 4500 BR SCT007 BKN008 OVC010 04/03 Q1027 TEMPO 2500=Wind 200 degrees, 10 kts, visibility 4500 m in mist, scattered clouds 700 ft., 	broken clouds 800ft, overcast 1,000 ft. temperature 4 deg.

The fire ignited combustible materials, including insulation blankets and spread upwards toward a flexible oxygen line mounted above the JB-1 junction box. The flexible oxygen line ignited when exposed to the fire, and the fire burned through the aircraft's fuselage. Evidence suggests that the fire initiated as a result of an electrical anomaly in the top portion of the JB-1 junction box, near bus bar and contactor components. This evidence includes melting of one side of the bus bar along the periphery of its connection to a terminal stud and severe thermal damage to the internal and, to a lesser degree, external surfaces of the K1XB contactor case. Despite the damage to the contactor case, the internal contacts did not appear to be stuck or exhibit signs of melting or excessive pitting. There were no other signs of arcing near any of these components. Numerous maintenance difficulties had occurred on the aircraft involving the external AC power supply system beginning approximately 10-weeks before the accident. To attempt to remedy the anomalies, several relays, electrical contactors, the AC power switch, the external ground power receptacle, and other electrical components were removed and replaced with new components. Several of these components were located in the upper section of the JB-1 junction box. The last of these actions occurred about 5-weeks before the accident.

The right main gear would not extend in the down and locked position. The crew attempted a landing with the right main gear up and possibly hoped to free the gear to extend, however, this was unsuccessful and they subsequently elected to land gear up on their second approach. The aircraft landed successfully on its belly and came to a stop on the runway. The aircraft landed between Taxiways P and Q and all 10 occupants were evacuated and were transported to the hospital as a precaution. There were no obvious injuries and there was no fire after landing. The aircraft sustained substantial damage to its propellers, flaps and aft belly area. Inspection by TSB indicated that the inboard right main landing gear door partially hung up on the wheel well structure, preventing the extension of the landing gear. The reason for the gear door interference is under investigation. This aircraft was involved in an unsafe gear incident the previous day at Winnipeg. FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1. The right inboard landing gear door was incorrectly rigged, which reduced the clearance between the tire and gear door during gear extension. The mis-rigged landing gear door likely went unnoticed through four separate inspections. 2. The combined effect of the mis-rigged gear door, the installation of a new re-capped tire with large dimensions, growing free play in the gear door bushings/linkage arrangement, and air loading on the gear door reduced clearances sufficiently that the number three tire caught on a ledge on the inboard door skin, preventing the right main gear from extending.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A09C0028 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: CADORS Number: 2009C0523  CADORS Number: 2009C0528 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  27 January 2025 C-FSLZ Perimeter Aviation 0 5 nm S of Norway House unk Fumes/smoke/odor event Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All three crew members were killed. The Saras airplane was scheduled for carrying out test flight no 49, which would include inflight engine shut down and relight procedure at 10000 feet AMSL.  The aircraft took-off from Bangalore-Hindustan Airport (BLR) at 14:55. The flight was cleared to flight level 100. After completing general handling checks at 9000ÂAMSL without any events, a single engine simulated approach was carried out on runway 09. At about 15:11 the crew were cleared to perform an overshoot.  The crew contacted the Bangalore Radar controller, who cleared them back to FL100 and proceed to sector Southwest 2 for carrying out the engine relight test procedure. The crew reported reaching 9000ÂAMSL in sector Southwest at about 15:18.  The no. 1 engine was then shut down and secured following the test procedure at about 15:31. After about 47 seconds, the no. 1 engine relight procedure was initiated at around 9200ÂAMSL. After a successful left engine shut down and its securing procedure, at about 15:31 left engine relight procedure was initiated at about 9200ÂAMSL. The propeller blade pitch was selected from feathered to fine. This led to an increased in propeller rpm from 5 to 55%. Side slip increased up to 28 degrees and bank angle changed from 8 deg right to 70 degrees left. The pitch attitude was seen reaching -42 degrees. Propeller rpm continued to increase to 91%. Then the aircraft went into a sudden dive from 9200Â to 7300Â for about 13 secs. The aircraft was brought under control at this altitude. The crew continued their attempt to relight the engine but this was not successful. Meanwhile the side slip remained at 22 degrees with a pitch attitude of about -15 deg. The speed remained at 130 kt and altitude reduced from 7000 feet to 5200 feet. A second relight attempt was successful but the airplane was still in a rapid descent passing 4800 feet. Rudder pedal forces increased to as high as 90 kg with aileron forces raising to 40 kg. The crew were not able to fully control the airplane and arrest the descent. It impacted the ground. The aircraft was completely destroyed due impact and fire. PROBABLE CAUSE(S): Incorrect relight procedure devised by the designer and adopted by the crew at insufficient height leading to rapid loss of altitude and abnormal behavior of aircraft resulted into accident. Contributory factors: a) Lack of crew coordination and cockpit procedures b) Handling of the controls c) Non-aborting of flight by the crew in coordination with the flight test Director after failure of first relight attempt. d) Devising engine relight procedures by NAL without consulting the propeller manufacturer.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: DGCA India Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NAL Saras crashes at Bangalore - crew dead (Bangalore Aviation 6-3-2009)   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

During the approach to runway 25L, the weather conditions at the airport were reported as wind 200 degrees at 20 knots, visibility 1,500 meters, and rain. Based on this information, the captain decided to take over control from the co-pilot for the landing. The captain later reported that he had the runway in sight passing through 1,000 feet on descent, so disengaged the auto pilot at 400 feet. At about 50 feet the aircraft drifted to the right and the captain initiated corrective action to regain the centreline. The aircraft touched down to the left of the runway 25 centerline and then commenced to drift to the right. The captain reported that he immediately commenced corrective action by using thrust reverser, but the aircraft increasingly crabbed along the runway with the tail to the right of runway heading.

The mishap aircraft terminated its mission and returned to Al Udeid Air Base, Qatar. The crew and mission personnel evacuated the aircraft safely without injury. The mishap occurred during operations in the Area of Responsibility (AOR). The mishap crew had begun aerial refuelling with a KC-135, when the mishap crew and personnel aboard heard and felt a loud bang throughout the midsection of the aircraft. The crew suspended refuelling to evaluate the aircraft to checkout their systems and evaluate the aircraft for any damage. Finding nothing apparently wrong, the crew re-latched to the tanker and attempted to continue the refuelling when another series of loud noises and vibrations were heard and felt throughout the aircraft. Personnel aboard the KC-135 observed a stream of vapour and fuel streaming from the E-8 and alerted the crew. The crew checked for damage through a rear window and observed fuel streaming from at least two holes in the left wing, just inboard of the number two engine. The crew opted to terminate the mission and return to Al Udeid. Maintenance personnel then examined the airplane and found that the number two main fuel tank had ruptured, causing extensive damage to the wing of the airplane. The Accident Investigation Board (AIB) President found, by clear and convincing evidence, that the mishap was caused when a civilian subcontractor employee inadvertently left a test plug in the fuel vent system of the Mishap Aircraft during recently completed Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM) performed on the MA. Additionally, the AIB President found by substantial evidence three factors which contributed to the mishap. First, the PDM subcontractor employed ineffective tool control measures. Second, the PDM subcontractor failed to follow Technical Order (TO) mandated procedures when employing the fuel vent test plug during PDM. Third, due to the relatively short period of time between takeoff and refuelling, the crew did not have the opportunity to burn a substantial amount of fuel from the number two fuel tank which could have allowed the dive ""flapper"" valve to open after the tanks excessive air pressure decreased to the point where the flapper valve would open. This explains why this mishap did not occur during ARs conducted between the time the MA left the PDM facility and the time of the mishap.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: USAF AIB Report number: Executive summary report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Scramble 402  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

The flight crew aborted the takeoff as the airplane was accelerating through 80 knots. Upon exiting the runway, the flight crew verified normal operation of both engines. The captain reported that he had no reason to suspect hot brakes due to minimal use and taxied back to the active runway where the flight was subsequently cleared for takeoff. During the second takeoff, which was initiated about 5 minutes and 43 seconds after the initial rejected takeoff, the flight crew heard and felt a loud bang followed by a sudden yaw to the right; the flight crew immediately aborted the takeoff. Shortly after, the flight crew heard a second loud bang, followed by a more severe yaw to the right. The flight crew slowed the airplane and exited onto a taxiway at the end of the runway. Upon exiting the airplane, the captain observed a fire near the left main landing gear and immediately evacuated the airplane. Examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed that the left main landing gear exhibited fire damage and that the tire was blown. A punctured hole within the right side of the fuselage was observed just aft of the cockpit. The flight crew reported that at the time of the accident the airplane weighed 20,772 pounds. Review of emergency procedures within the aircraft flight manual revealed that a high energy stop inspection of the aircraft was required following the initial rejected takeoff due to the aircraft exceeding the maximum brake energy weight at the time of the initial rejected takeoff. The maximum brake energy weight was calculated to be 20,300 pounds. Probable Cause: The flight crew's failure to follow the manufacturerâs aircraft flight manual emergency procedures following a rejected takeoff that required a high energy stop inspection. Contributing to the accident was the flight's exceedence of the aircraft's maximum brake energy weight.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: WPR09LA151 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates18-Mar-2009 11:59 harro Added 18-Mar-2009 12:03 harro Updated 21-Dec-2016 19:25 ASN Update Bot Updated [Time, Damage, Category, Investigating agency, ]01-Dec-2017 12:16 ASN Update Bot Updated [Cn, Operator, Other fatalities, Nature, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The takeoff was planned as a reduced-power takeoff and the first officer was the handling pilot for the departure. At 22:31:53, the captain called for the first officer to rotate. The first officer attempted to rotate the aircraft, but it did not respond immediately with a nose-up pitch. The captain again called 'rotate' and the first officer applied a greater nose-up command. The nose of the aircraft was raised and the tail made contact with the runway surface, but the aircraft did not begin to climb. The captain then selected TOGA on the thrust levers, the engines responded immediately, and the aircraft commenced a climb. The crew notified air traffic control of the tail strike and that they would be returning to Melbourne. While reviewing the aircraftÂs performance documentation in preparation for landing, the crew noticed that a takeoff weight, which was 100 tonnes below the actual takeoff weight of the aircraft, had inadvertently been used when completing the takeoff performance calculation. The result of that incorrect takeoff weight was to produce a thrust setting and takeoff reference speeds that were lower than those required for the actual aircraft weight. The aircraft subsequently landed at Melbourne with no reported injuries. The tail strike resulted in substantial damage to the tail of the aircraft and damaged some airport lighting and the instrument landing system. As a result of the accident, the aircraft operator has advised the Australian Transport Safety Bureau that it is reviewing a number of procedures including human factors involved in takeoff performance data entry. CONTRIBUTING SAFETY FACTORS: - The first officer inadvertently entered the incorrect take-off weight into the electronic flight bag to calculate the take-off performance parameters for the flight. - The captain was distracted while checking the take-off performance figures in the electronic flight bag, which resulted in him not detecting the incorrect take-off weight. - During the pre-departure phase, the flight crew did not complete all of the tasks in the standard operating procedures, which contributed to them not detecting the error. - When conducting the loadsheet confirmation procedure, the first officer called out 362.9 tonnes as the FLEX take-off weight, rather than the 262.9 tonnes that was recorded on the master flight plan, which removed an opportunity for the captain to detect the error. - The first officer changed the first digit of the FLEX take-off weight on the master flight plan during the loadsheet confirmation procedure, believing it had been transcribed incorrectly, which removed an opportunity for the flight crew to detect the error. - The lack of a designated position in the pre-flight documentation to record the green dot speed precipitated a number of informal methods of recording that value, lessening the effectiveness of the green dot check within the loadsheet confirmation procedure. [Minor safety issue] - The flight crewÂs mixed fleet flying routinely exposed them to large variations in take-off weights and take-off performance parameters, which adversely influenced their ability to form an expectation of the ÂreasonablenessÂ of the calculated take-off performance parameters CONTRIBUTING SAFETY FACTORS: - The first officer inadvertently entered the incorrect take-off weight into the electronic flight bag to calculate the take-off performance parameters for the flight. - The captain was distracted while checking the take-off performance figures in the electronic flight bag, which resulted in him not detecting the incorrect take-off weight. - During the pre-departure phase, the flight crew did not complete all of the tasks in the standard operating procedures, which contributed to them not detecting the error. - When conducting the loadsheet confirmation procedure, the first officer called out 362.9 tonnes as the FLEX take-off weight, rather than the 262.9 tonnes that was recorded on the master flight plan, which removed an opportunity for the captain to detect the error. - The first officer changed the first digit of the FLEX take-off weight on the master flight plan during the loadsheet confirmation procedure, believing it had been transcribed incorrectly, which removed an opportunity for the flight crew to detect the error. - The lack of a designated position in the pre-flight documentation to record the green dot speed precipitated a number of informal methods of recording that value, lessening the effectiveness of the green dot check within the loadsheet confirmation procedure.

The airplane contacted Narita Tower at 06:41 and received a landing clearance for runway 34L. Wind information passed on to the crew indicated gusting winds. As the airplane was probably flying through rough air, the autopilot and autothrottle had difficulties to control airspeed and attitude.  At 06:47:40 the CAWS announced 500 ft. The calibrated airspeed (CAS) was frequently fluctuating and at this moment the CAS was about 179 kts. The range of CAS fluctuation was from 152 to 180 kt which was 12 kts slower and 16 kts faster than the selected approach speed of 164 kts. This exceeded the stabilized approach criteria. The pilot monitoring called ""stabilize"" and most likely let the pilot flying continue approaching, disregarding airspeed deviation of more than Vapp plus 10 kt.  The autopilot was disconnected at 198 ft radio altitude, while the autothrottle remained engaged. The pitch angle then decreased from 1.4Â° while the CAS was 178.5 kts. The airplane was almost on the glide slope at this point. Just after the autopilot was disconnected, the pitch angle temporarily decreased as low as 0.4Â° but it increased to 3.5Â° by the time the airplane descended to 92 ft.  In the meantime, the CAS decreased as low as 154 ft (Vapp minus 10 kt) and the airplane descended about half a dot below the glide slope. It is highly probable that this large speed decrease stemmed from the inability of the autothrottle system to counteract the large wind velocity change (decreasing head wind component) during the descent and the fact that the thrust was kept at idle during the increment of the pitch angle to 3.5Â°. The increased pitch angle and corresponding column input indicates the pilot flying's intention to correct the lowered flight path.  The CAS increased to 161 kt from 154 kt, but it was still slower than Vapp (164 kt). The deviation from the glide slope had increased to -1.11 dot.  The pilot flying began correcting the heading to correct for the cross wind component from the left and align the longitudinal axis with the runway centerline.  When the radio altimeter indicated about 48 ft, the pitch angle was 1.1Â° and a sink rate was about 13 fps. The autothrottle was engaged, and the thrust levers were in the retard mode which started to automatically decrease the thrust below 50 ft, reaching idle when descending through 20 ft.  The pilot flying initiated the flare later than usual at 20 ft, not at 30 ft. Rapid and large column input during flare indicates the pilot's recognition of the late flare. The pitch angle remained 1.1Â° (about 2Â° lower than usual) until the flare, and the pitch angle temporarily decreased to 0.7Â° (below 20 ft) followed by the quick increment of the pitch angle to 4.6Â° in 2 seconds before touchdown.  The control column was pushed largely forward (-4.9Â°) just before the touchdown. The airplane consequently experienced a large sink rate upon the first touchdown as high as 7 fps. Vertical acceleration spiked to 1.63 G and the airplane bounced. The forward control column input just before and during the touchdown most likely resulted in the rapid derotation from 4.6Â° at the first touchdown to below zero in 1.5 seconds. The decreasing pitch angle, with the main landing gear still in the air, may have made it difficult for the pilot flying to recognize the need for bounce recovery due to his lowering eye point. It may be possible that he didn't realize the airplane had bounced. The airplane then touched down on the nose landing gear with a pitch angle of -1.8Â°, followed later by the main landing gear. After touchdown the nosegear rebounded off quickly increasing the pitch angle, leading to increased lift, resulting in a high bounce to 16 ft above the runway.  The nose dropped again and the airplane landed on the nosegear followed by the main landing gears. As the airplane was rolling to the left, the left main gear first touched down, followed by the center landing gear and the right main gear. The recorded vertical acceleration at this time was 3.06 G. The airplane sink rate was estimated to be 21.5 fps at the third touchdown. It is highly probable that the airplaneÂs kinetic energies at the third touchdown exceeded the certification requirements by almost seven times.  The left wing attachment point to the fuselage fractured. The fuselage rolled to the left with the lift generated by the right wing and a fire erupted. The airplane rolled inverted and was consumed by fire. PROBABLE CAUSES: In this accident, when the airplane landed on Runway 34L at Narita International Airport, it fell into porpoising. It is highly probable that the left wing fractured as the load transferred from the left MLG to the left wing structure on the third touchdown surpassed the design limit (ultimate load).  It is highly probable that a fire broke out as the fuel spillage from the left wing caught fire, and the airplane swerved left off the runway rolling to the left and came to rest inverted on the grass area.  The direct causes which the airplane fell into the porpoise phenomenon are as follows:  a. Large nose-down elevator input at the first touchdown resulted in a rapid nose-down motion during the first bounce, followed by the second touchdown on the NLG with negative pitch attitude. Then the pitch angle rapidly increased by the ground reaction force, causing the larger second bounce, and  b. The PF's large elevator input in an attempt to control the airplane without thrust during the second bounce.  In addition, the indirect causes are as follows:  a. Fluctuating airspeed, pitch attitude due to gusty wind resulted in an approach with a large sink rate,  b. Late flare with large nose-up elevator input resulted in the first bounce and  c. Large pitch attitude change during the bounce possibly made it difficult for the crewmembers to judge airplane pitch attitude and airplane height relative to the ground (MLG height above the runway).  d. The PM's advice, override and takeover were not conducted adequately.  It is somewhat likely that, if the fuse pin in the MLG support structure had failed and the MLG had been separated in the overload condition in which the vertical load is the primary component, the damage to the fuel tanks would have been reduced to prevent the fire from developing rapidly.  It is probable that the fuse pin did not fail because the failure mode was not assumed under an overload condition in which the vertical load is the primary component due to the interpretation of the requirement at the time of type certification for the MD-11 series airplanes.METAR: 21:00 UTC / 06:00 local time: RJAA 222100Z 30013G28KT 260V330 9999 FEW020 13/M01 Q0998 NOSIG21:00 UTC / 06:00 local time: RJAA 222100Z 30013G28KT 260V330 9999 FEW020 13/M01 Q0998 NOSIG RMK 1CU020 A2948 21:08 UTC / 06:08 local time: RJAA 222108Z 31025G35KT 9999 FEW020 12/M01 Q0998 RMK 1CU020 A294921:30 UTC / 06:30 local time: RJAA 222130Z 32026G40KT 9999 FEW020 12/M02 Q0999 WS R34L NOSIG21:30 UTC / 06:30 local time: RJAA 222130Z 32026G40KT 9999 FEW020 12/M02 Q0999 WS R34L NOSIG RMK 1CU020 A2952 P/RR21:30 UTC / 06:30 local time: RJAA 222130Z 32026G40KT 9999 FEW020 12/M02 Q0999 WS R34L NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: JTSB Report number: AA2013-4 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: Kyodo, Asahi  JTSB History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  19 May 1999 N813DE Delta Air Lines 0 Cambridge Airport, Teversham, Cambridge sub Tailstrike Location  Images: photo (c) JTSB; Tokyo-Narita Airport (NRT/RJAA); 23 March 2009 photo (c) JTSB; Tokyo-Narita Airport (NRT/RJAA); 23 March 2009 photo (c) JTSB; Tokyo-Narita Airport (NRT/RJAA); 23 March 2009 photo (c) JTSB; Tokyo-Narita Airport (NRT/RJAA); 23 March 2009 photo (c) JTSB; Tokyo-Narita Airport (NRT/RJAA); 23 March 2009 photo (c) JTSB; Tokyo-Narita Airport (NRT/RJAA); 23 March 2009 photo (c) Harro Ranter; ZÃ¼rich-Kloten Airport (ZRH/LSZH) [HB]; 03 August 2002 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All six crew members were killed. The flight departed Jayapura (DJJ) on an scheduled cargo/passenger flight to Wamena (WMX). The airplane carried staples such as rice and flour. The crew consisted of a captain, co-pilot, engineer, loadmaster and two flight attendants.  The aircraft was being operated under the instrument flight rules (IFR) for the sector from Sentani, and a visual descent, approach and landing at Wamena, because there was no published instrument approach procedure at Wamena. There was low cloud with a base of 300 meters on the final approach track to runway 15 at Wamena. The aircraft tracked parallel to, and to the right of the extended runway 15 centreline. During that approach, and while descending through 6,234 feet (790 feet by radio altimeter), the EGPWS voice aural alert 'TERRAIN TERRAIN' sounded. When the aircraft was passing 6,200 feet (991 feet by radio altimeter) on descent, the EGPWS voice aural alert 'WHOOP WHOOP, PULL UP' sounded. The aircraft started turning left toward runway as it was passing 5,719 feet (540 feet radio altimeter) on descent. As the aircraft passed 5,693 feet (516 feet radio altimeter) on descent, the crew informed the controller that they had the runway in sight. During their attempt to intercept the final approach track, while passing 5,531 feet (320 feet radio altimeter) the captain commented to the copilot ""wah nembak lagi"" [we are overshooting again]. During the interception towards the runway an EGPWS voice aural alert 'SINK RATE', sounded. This was immediately followed by the voice aural alert 'WHOOP WHOOP, PULL UP' sounding five times. The copilot instructed the captain ""overshoot, overshoot"" after the second of the five 'WHOOP WHOOP, PULL UP' sounds. The FDR showed that the aircraft commenced a go around from a low height above the runway. The controller offered the crew a choice of a landing on runway 33, but the crew elected to make a right circuit for runway 15. The circuit was flown at a height of between 150 and 350 feet above the aerodrome elevation. During the downwind leg the EGPWS provided the flight crew with eight 'DON'T SINK' and one 'TOO LOW TERRAIN' voice aural alerts. The flight crew did not respond to any of those alerts. As the aircraft passed abeam the threshold of runway 15, the landing gear was lowered for the second landing approach. During the right base turn the aircraft was initially flown at a constant 30 degree angle of right bank. About 100 degrees from runway heading, the copilot said ""OK, sungai ketok"" [OK river in sight]. Four seconds later, when about 85 degrees from runway heading the copilot said ""Pike clear"" [Pike Hill visible]. As the aircraft's heading passed 65 degrees from the runway heading, the copilot called ""be careful pak"" [be careful sir]. A third person in the cockpit commented ""di kiri ada bukit"" [there is a hill on the left]. This was immediately followed, as the aircraft banked through 41 degrees right, by the copilot calling out with increasing concern, ""pak, pak, pak, open pak, kiri, kiri"" [sir, sir, sir, open, sir, left, left]. The engine power was rapidly increased immediately after the copilot called ""open pak"" [open sir]. The copilot commanded ""kiri pak""[left sir] as the captain rolled the aircraft into a left bank and the EGPWS voice aural alert 'DON'T SINK, DON'T SINK' sounded. As the bank angle exceeded 40 degrees, it entered a 10-degree nosedown pitch attitude. The copilot warned the captain ""don't sink"". The captain immediately responded ""ya, ya"". Three seconds later the copilot said ""left turn"". The EGPWS then sounded the following voice aural alerts in rapid succession: 'TOO LOW - TERRAIN', 'BANK ANGLE - BANK ANGLE', 'TERRAIN - TERRAIN'. At the same time as the EGPWS sounded the 'TERRAIN - TERRAIN' warning, the copilot called with high intonation ""pak, pak, pak"" [sir, sir, sir]. The nose-down pitch attitude reached 6 degrees when the aircraft reached 49 degrees left bank. As the aircraft reached 49 degrees left bank, landing gear retraction commenced. The EGPWS voice aural alert then sounded TERRAIN, and one second later the copilot called ""pak"" [sir]. At the point of impact with the terrain, the landing gear was half way through the retraction cycle, the left bank was 16 degrees, and the aircraft pitch was 12 degrees nose up. The indicated airspeed at impact was 146 knots. The aircraft impacted Pikei Hill on Tengah Mountain.  Wamena Airport is situated at the Baliem Valley with an airport elevation of 5085 feet and surrounded by mountains up to 12.000 feet high. The only navigation aid available is NDB "" ZW"". The instrument approach procedure is not available for this aerodrome. This aerodrome is VFR operation only. CAUSES: The crew did not appear to have awareness of the aircraftÂs proximity with terrain until impact with terrain was imminent. The flight crew did not act on the Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System aural warnings, and did not conform to the operatorÂs published operating procedures. Together, those factors resulted in the aircraftÂs impact with terrain.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSC Report number: KNKT 09.12.04.01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Antara  Tempo Interaktif  Ministry of Transportation (Indonesia), press release History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  22 July 2008 PK-BRD Aviastar Mandiri 0 Jayapura-Sentani Airport (DJJ/WAJJ) Location  Images: photo (c) NTSC; near Wamena Airport (WMX/WAJW); April 2009 photo (c) NTSC; near Wamena Airport (WMX/WAJW); April 2009 photo (c) NTSC; near Wamena Airport (WMX/WAJW); April 2009 photo (c) NTSC; April 2009 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

One 6 year old boy died, and seven others were badly injured. The Aereotuy plane carried ten tourists on a flight to Ciudad BolÃ­var. During takeoff the airplane could not gain altitude, continued off the departure end, and collided with a powerline, 80 meters past the end of runway 36. Weather conditions at the time of the accident were poor due to cumulo nimbus clouds to the north of the airfield. There were puddles of water on the runway as a result of rainfall. Runway 36 is a 2100 m long asphalt runway. The airplane lined up for takeoff on the last third of the runway. Cause (translated from Spanish) The accident occurred as a result of the inability of the aircraft to take off, affected by the tailwind and water puddles that covered part of the runway, which did not allow speed to build up, crashing into the ground. It is considered that the most likely cause of the accident was mismanagement by the crew, in the sense of failing to make adequate planning and analysis, coupled with overconfidence and lack of identification of hazardous conditions at that time of takeoff. Based on our [JIAAC] investigations, we can infer that there were several contributing causes for the occurrence of this accident. In this order, we can state the following: - Adverse weather and tailwind conditions associated with the phenomenon. - Incorrect management by the crew to use only the last third of the runway with the meteorological conditions prevailing at that time. - Failure of the aerodrome administration to identify and correct poor drainage of the runway. - Failure of the Autoridad AeronÃ¡utica to monitor safety. - Rejection by the crew of the concatenated form in which the factors involved in this event developed. After all the analysis to different causes involved in this accident, we can point to as the main Causal Factor: Human Factor, due to the mismanagement by the flight crew upon takeoff in these conditions. Physical and Material factors included everything related to the prevailing weather conditions, road conditions and lack of services at the aerodrome by the authorities; all of them are considered Contributing Factors.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JIAAC Venezuela Report number: 025/2009 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: Rescate ORH  NTSB   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were no injuries to the 210 passengers or 10 crew members onboard but the airplane received substantial damage. During the initial approach, the flight encountered gusty wind conditions (16 knots gusting to 24 knots). As a result, the flight crew added an appropriate wind additive to the reference landing speed (Vref). The airplane touched down in the touchdown zone approximately 1,600 feet from the threshold with a recorded normal acceleration (Nz) consistent with a ""firm"" landing. As the main gear touched down, a full nose down column was applied that produced a very high nose-down pitch rate, which resulted in a hard nose gear touchdown. The recorded normal acceleration at nose gear touchdown was 1.8 g, however, the actual load applied at the nose gear was much higher because the accelerometers are located in the main gear wheel well. The peak nose gear load experienced at nose gear contact exceeded the design-limit load by as much as 46%. The recorded normal and pitch accelerations, calculated data, and estimated nose gear loads confirm that the aircraft experienced a bending moment that exceeded both the design requirements and the structural capability of the fuselage. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The first officerÂs input of full nose down elevator at touchdown. Contributing to the accident was the gusty wind conditions.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA09FA045 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  4 November 2013 CN-RNT Royal Air Maroc - RAM 0 Montreal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport, QC (YUL/CYUL) non Fumes/smoke/odor event Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; New York-John F.

Thinking this was residual fuel, he 'spooled the engine.Ã¢â¬Â Realizing there was a fire, he called for assistance and shut off the fuel selectors and firewall shutoff valve. After the accident, a FAA inspector examined the airplane and reported extensive thermal damage to the fuselage sub-frame and evidence of an engine fire. Numerous engine turbine blades were found on the pavement adjacent to where the fire occurred. A disassembly and inspection of the engine revealed that one or more of the compressor turbine (CT) blades failed. The engine was overhauled about 6 hours prior to the accident. The CT blades were manufactured under the FAA Parts Manufacture Approval (PMA) program. Extreme heat damage obliterated the fracture surfaces of the blades, therefore the reason for the blade failure(s) could not be determined. A functional test of the fuel control unit (FCU) revealed the Sg (specific gravity) dome, high idle stop screw, and minimum flow stop were set above the recommended range, which would result in higher than normal fuel flow. The FCU adjustments appeared to be made after the overhaul, however it could not be determined when the adjustments occurred. Although the higher than normal fuel flow setting probably did not result in the CT blade failures, it could have exacerbated the thermal damage and fire. Probable Cause: A loss of engine power due to the failure of one or more compressor turbine blades for an undetermined reason.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA09LA269 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB ERA09LA269  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates03-Oct-2022 19:43 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

There were no injuries and there was some damage to the aircraft. Findings as to Causes and Contributing Factors 1. The crewmembers were likely focused on having the pilot flying (PF) achieve a successful flare, to the exclusion of monitoring other approach parameters. 2. The captain provided vague instructions on managing power during the approach and the resultant settings went unchecked, resulting in an undesirable descent rate close to the ground. 3. The engine power was not adjusted sufficiently to arrest the descent rate and the aircraft was pitched to the contact angle in the flare, resulting in the aft fuselage striking the runway.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A09O0073 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight was a regularly scheduled passenger flight which departed from Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport, MN (MSP) at 11:39. The flight to the DEN area was reported as routine, with VFR weather prevailing. At about 12:02, as the flight was entering the DEN terminal area, the crew briefed an approach speed of 139 knots for a visual approach to runway 16L. The First Officer (FO) was the pilot flying (PF) and reported the approach was stable at 1,000 feet above the runway threshold. At 12:16:15 ATC cleared the flight to land and issued a wind advisory of 260 degrees at 5 knots. The flight crew extended the gear and selected flaps 3. The autopilot was disengaged at 12:17:38, at approximately 750 feet above touchdown. The auto-thrust and flight directors were engaged. During the approach, the crew noted that the aircraft was experiencing approximately 7 knots of tailwind, and as the approach progressed FDR data indicated the tailwind component increased to approximately 11 knots. As the airplane passed approximately 50 feet above touchdown the rate of descent was about 800 feet per minute (fpm). The captain stated he expected nothing more than a firm touchdown. The FO initiated the flare at about 45 feet. He stated that he attempted to arrest the sink rate with larger than normal aft stick deflection. During the flare, passing 20 feet above the runway, the automated ""retard"" call-out began a sequence of three annunciations. This automatic call-out is designed to remind the pilot to move the thrust levers to the idle detent. The thrust levers remained in the climb detent (CLB). During the flare, the airplane pitched up to about eight degrees nose up and airspeed decreased to about 132 knots. The airplane touched down on both main landing gear with a vertical load of about 1.56 G. At the time of initial touchdown, the thrust levers were still in CLB, and engine N1 increased from approximately 54% to 64% over 3 seconds. Radio altimeter values increased, indicating the aircraft then bounced. The FO held 16 degrees aft stick input (approximately full aft travel), and moved the thrust levers to idle during the bounce. Ground spoilers deployed (thrust lever position and wheel spin up logic was satisfied) and the airplane touched down a second time in an eleven degree nose up attitude, with FO still applying full aft stick input. At this point the captain began adding some nose down stick input however pitch attitude continued increasing to about 12.5 degrees nose up. The Airbus FCOM indicates that the max pitch up angle with gear compressed is 11.7 degrees. A ""dual input"" automatic call-out was recorded, indicating the system detected both pilots making stick inputs, and the sound of a loud bang was heard on the cockpit voice recorder. As the captain stick input moved further forward, in the airplane nose down direction, and the FO stick back pressure relaxed, the airplane began to pitch downward and about 3 seconds after the loud bang the nose wheel touched down. Thrust levers were then moved to the reverse position and autobraking began. The remainder of the roll out was normal. The aircraft experienced heavy abrasions, dents and perforations of the skin along the lower rear fuselage between frames 62 and 76. Additionally, the aft galley drain mast and two aircraft antennas were broken, and the APU air intake sustained damage. The rear pressure bulkhead damage was buckled and cracked. The lower segment of frame 70 was cracked and had heavy abrasions. Interior damage also consisted of minor deformation of frames, damage to stringers, frame clips, fasteners, floor support strut fittings and flange. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The first officerÂs excessive pitch-up of the airplane while landing with a tailwind, which resulted in a tailstrike following a bounced landing. Contributing to the bounced landing were a high descent rate and excessive thrust resulting from the first officerÂs delay in retarding the thrust levers to idle, thereby providing residual thrust and preventing spoiler deployment.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA09FA047 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  NTSB accident docket   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Denver International Airport, CO (DEN/KDEN); May 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Denver International Airport, CO (DEN/KDEN); May 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Denver International Airport, CO (DEN/KDEN); May 2009; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

When he went back to a visual scan of the instruments, he noted that the flight director was flagged off and that both the pilot and co-pilot attitude indicators were off. The pilot declared an emergency with air traffic control, reduced the throttles to idle, and pulled back on the controls. After the airplane came out of the bottom of the clouds and the pilot regained visual contact with the ground, the airplane was in a 60-degree left turn at approximately 80 knots of airspeed. After the pilot regained control, the flight director and all instruments began working again. The pilot then re-engaged the autopilot and continued to his destination, where he landed without further incident. Examination of the flight director system, gyros, and attitude indicators at the aircraft manufacturer's facilities failed to identify a failure or malfunction with the flight instruments.

The seven crew members escaped unhurt. The airplane operated on a repositioning flight from Jeddah. During the flight, the captain discussed the use of manual spoilers during landing with the first officer. He further stated that; as he ""had only around 400 hours in the aircraft"" as a captain, he wanted to ""see the effect' of landing with manual spoilers. He further explained that the flight provided an opportunity to ""do it manually"" (use manual spoilers) as it was a repositioning flight and, the weather and dry runway conditions were ideal. As such, he discussed the procedure with the first officer and elected to land with the auto ground spoiler system unarmed. The flight was uneventful. During the approach to Riyadh the Landing Checklist was completed, which included the arming of the auto ground spoiler system for landing. After the Landing Checklist was completed, the captain disarmed the auto ground spoiler system with the intention of applying manual ground spoilers after landing. The auto braking system was also not armed prior to landing. The final approach and touchdown to runway 15 Left at Riyadh were uneventful. The touchdown airspeed was 135 knots calibrated air speed (CAS).  On touchdown, the captain manually extended the spoiler/speed brake lever, but did not latch it in the fully extended (EXT) position (fully aft and latched upwards). The captain then removed his right hand from the speed brake lever in order to deploy the thrust reversers. The first officer noted the movement of the spoiler/speed brake lever and called ""Spoilers Deployed"".  Since the spoiler/speed brake lever was not fully pulled aft and latched upwards, the lever automatically returned to the forward retracted (RET) position. This movement of the spoiler/speed brake lever was not noticed by the captain and the first officer. In response, the ground spoilers re-stowed before being fully deployed and, a speed brake/flap configuration (SPD BRK/FLP CONFIG) Level 1 Amber Alert occurred. This alert occurred as the aircraft was not yet fully weight on wheels (WOW) and the aircraft still sensed a flight condition with speed brakes deployed and flaps extended beyond six degrees. Six seconds after touchdown on the right main landing gear, the nose gear touched down and the aircraft transferred to a ground condition (WOW on nose gear and main wheel spin up). The SPD BRK/FLP CONFIG alert extinguished when the nose gear oleo actuated ground shift on landing.  After touchdown, the aircraft banked to the right and began to drift right of the runway centerline. In response, he applied left rudder, deployed the thrust reversers and applied left aileron. But this did not have any noticeable effect. The captain saw the approaching G4 taxiway exit and in an attempt to keep the aircraft from leaving the runway surface beyond the G4 taxiway exit, he decided to direct the aircraft towards the taxiway. He then applied a right rudder input which caused the aircraft to commence a rapid sweeping turn to the right towards the G4 taxiway exit. The aircraft left the runway at high speed, traversed the full width of the G4 taxiway, and exited the surface at its southern edge. The aircraft then entered a sand section and travelled the distance infield between the edge of the G4 taxiway and the adjacent section of taxiway GOLF. The left main landing gear collapsed during this time. The aircraft came to rest on taxiway GOLF. There was no post impact fire. Cause Related Findings 1. The Captain decided to land with manual ground spoilers when the auto ground spoiler system was fully operational. 2. The initiative by the Captain to conduct this improvised exercise contravened the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and the Flight Operations Policy Manual (FOPM). 3. The auto ground spoiler system was disarmed prior to landing. 4. The spoiler/speed brake lever was partially applied manually after landing. 5. The spoiler/speed brake lever was released before it was fully extended and latched. 6. The spoiler/speed brake lever automatically retracted as per design. 7. The ground spoilers never fully deployed. 8. The loss of lift and aircraft deceleration were greatly reduced by the lack of ground spoiler deployment. 9. Brakes were not used in an attempt to control or slowdown the aircraft. 10. The Captain applied a large right rudder input with the intention of directing the aircraft onto the G4 taxiway exit. 11. The aircraft exited the runway at high speed and was travelling too fast to successfully negotiate the right turn onto the G4 taxiway.Sources: Accident Report Saudi Arabian Airlines - Flight SVA 9061 MD 90-30, Registration HZ-APW King Khaled International Airport - Riyadh Kingdom of Saudi Arabia / GACA   Location  Images: photo (c) Konstantin von Wedelstaedt; Dubai Airport (DXB/OMDB); 12 February 2005 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The positioning flight was conducted using instrument flight rules and had departed Scottsdale Airport, AZ (SDL) at 15:03 MST. The pilot occupying the left seat was not injured and the pilot occupying the right seat received minor injuries.  In a statement to the NTSB provided by the Pilot-In-Command, upon arrival to TEX the weather was reported to be below minimums; the crew elected to hold over the Cones VOR and wait to see if weather conditions would improve. The crew was given instructions, by air traffic control, to hold as published and to expect further clearance (EFC) at 16:30. When the weather improved to a visibility of 4 miles and a ceiling of 2300 feet, the PIC requested a descent and approach to KTEX. At approximately 4 miles from the airport, the pilot acquired the airport environment but was not in position to land, so he called for a missed approach back to Cones VOR. The pilot then requested a second attempt to land stating that ""if we did not land, we would like to be sequenced to into KMTJ"" Montrose Regional Airport Montrose, CO, their alternate airport. On the second approach, both crew members stated that they had acquired the runway environment; however, they were still too high for a visual approach. The crew elected to do a 360-degree, right, descending turn, in order to get in a better position for landing. On completion of the turn, they again affirmed the runway environment and that they were aligned with the extended centerline of the runway. The airplane touched down and after full thrust reversers were deployed, the nose gear collapsed. The airplane began to slide in snow and came to a stop about mid-field, in an upright position. An initial FAA examination of the area indicated that the airplane had touched down about 20-feet to the right, of the runway. Additionally, the airplane's wings were torn from the fuselage and the tail section had separated just aft of the engines, during the contact with the ground. Weather reported at KTEX 10 minutes prior to the accident was winds 260 degrees at 8 knots, visibility of 3 miles, scattered clouds at 400 feet, broken clouds at 2300 feet, temperature of 6 degrees Celsius, dew point of 6 degrees Celsius, and altimeter setting 29.85 inches of mercury.

One of these aircraft, RA-76827, was piloted by a captain who needed currency on the IL-76 and an instructor pilot. During the descent towards Makhachkala, visibility deteriorated quickly from 2000 m to 300-350 m due to the formation of advection-radiation fog.  At 20:43, the controller reported a visibility of 800 m, and 1200 m at the runway to the flight crew. However, by that time the visibility had already decreased further. Also, the instructor pilot was not allowed to land in these conditions. At 20:45 the aircraft was 5,59 km from the runway the controller reported that the visibility was 500 m and 1100 m at the runway. At a distance of 1100 m from runway 14, the instructor pilot saw the approach lights and decided to continue to land By that time, another Il-76 (RA-76825) had taxied to the runway for departure and was waiting on taxiway 2. The hold short line on this taxiway was placed at a distance of 91,30 m from the center line of the runway instead of 120 m. At an altitude of 40 m, the navigator of RA-76827 stated the headlights still needed to be switched on. No action was taken.  Just prior commencing the flare, the aircraft entered an area of limited visibility due to advective radiation fog. The aircraft deviated to the left of the centreline and touched down 1 metre inside the runway edge. During the rollout the left-hand wing struck the flight deck of the stationary airplane (RA-76825) on taxiway 2, ripping away a large part of the forward fuselage. A fire erupted. Four of the seven crew members died. RA-76827 suffered damage to the wing but none of the 31 occupants were hurt.

One of these aircraft, RA-76827, was piloted by a captain who needed currency on the IL-76 and an instructor pilot. During the descent towards Makhachkala, visibility deteriorated quickly from 2000 m to 300-350 m due to the formation of advection-radiation fog.  At 20:43, the controller reported a visibility of 800 m, and 1200 m at the runway to the flight crew. However, by that time the visibility had already decreased further. Also, the instructor pilot was not allowed to land in these conditions. At 20:45 the aircraft was 5,59 km from the runway the controller reported that the visibility was 500 m and 1100 m at the runway. At a distance of 1100 m from runway 14, the instructor pilot saw the approach lights and decided to continue to land By that time, another Il-76 (RA-76825) had taxied to the runway for departure and was waiting on taxiway 2. The hold short line on this taxiway was placed at a distance of 91,30 m from the center line of the runway instead of 120 m. At an altitude of 40 m, the navigator of RA-76827 stated the headlights still needed to be switched on. No action was taken.  Just prior commencing the flare, the aircraft entered an area of limited visibility due to advective radiation fog. The aircraft deviated to the left of the centreline and touched down 1 metre inside the runway edge. During the rollout the left-hand wing struck the flight deck of the stationary airplane (RA-76825) on taxiway 2, ripping away a large part of the forward fuselage. A fire erupted. Four of the seven crew members died. RA-76827 suffered damage to the wing but none of the 31 occupants were hurt.

The flight was en route to Charlotte Douglas International Airport (CLT), North Carolina, USA, and departed LaGuardia runway 04 at 15:24. At this time, the first officer was the pilot flying (PF), and the captain was the pilot monitoring (PM). The takeoff and initial portion of the climb were uneventful. At 15:25:45, the LaGuardia ATCT local controller instructed the flight crew to contact the New York Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) LGA departure controller. The captain contacted the departure controller at 15:25:51, advising him that the airplane was at 700 feet and climbing to 5,000 feet. The controller then instructed the flight to climb to and maintain 15,000 feet, and the captain acknowledged the instruction.  At 15:27:10, the captain stated, ""birds."" One second later, at an altitude of 2,818 feet above ground level, the crew heard thumps and thuds followed by a shuddering sound. The aircraft had struck several Canada geese. Immediately after the bird encounter, both engines' fan and core (N1 and N2, respectively) speeds started to decelerate.  At 15:27:14, the first officer stated, ""uh oh,"" followed by the captain stating, ""we got one rol- both of 'em rolling back.""  The captain then stated he would start the APU and took over control of the airplane. At 15:27:28, the captain instructed the first officer to ""get the QRH [quick reference handbook] loss of thrust on both engines"", and reported the emergency situation to the LGA departure controller, stating, ""mayday mayday maydayÂthis is...Cactus fifteen thirty nine hit birds, we've lost thrust in both engines, we're turning back towards LaGuardia."" The LGA departure controller acknowledged the captain's statement and then instructed him to turn left heading 220Â°. The first officer began conducting Part 1 of the QRH ENG DUAL FAILURE checklist (Engine Dual Failure checklist), stating, ""if fuel remaining, engine mode selector, ignition,"" and the captain responded, ""ignition."" The first officer then stated, ""thrust levers confirm idle,"" and the captain responded, ""idle."" About 4 seconds later, the first officer stated, ""airspeed optimum relight. three hundred knots. we don't have that,"" and the captain responded, ""we don't."" At 15:28:05, the LGA departure controller asked the captain if he wanted to try to land on runway 13 at LGA if it was available, and the captain responded, ""we're unable. we may end up in the Hudson [River].""  The LGA departure controller cleared the flight for a left-hand traffic pattern for runway 31, but the captain responded, ""unable."" The controller then stated that runway 4 at LGA was available, and the captain responded, ""I'm not sure we can make any runway. Uh what's over to our right anything in New Jersey maybe Teterboro?"" The controller replied, ""ok yeah, off your right side is Teterboro Airport [TEB]."" Subsequently, the departure controller asked the captain if he wanted to try going to TEB, and the captain replied, ""yes."" At 15:29:11, the captain announced on the public address (PA) system, ""this is the Captain, brace for impact."" Meanwhile the pilots were working the checklist to restart the engines.  At 15:29:21, the LGA departure controller instructed the captain to turn right 280Â° for runway 1 at TEB. But the captain responded: ""we can't do it.""  The departure controller then asked the captain which runway at TEB he would like, and the captain responded, ""we're gonna be in the Hudson."" When it became clear that the engines would not restart, the captain requested to first officer to select the flaps.  At 15:30:43, the aircraft landed on the surface of the Hudson River. Within seconds after the ditching, the crewmembers and passengers initiated evacuation of the airplane. Subsequently, all of the occupants were evacuated from the airplane and rescued by area responders. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The ingestion of large birds into each engine, which resulted in an almost total loss of thrust in both engines and the subsequent ditching on the Hudson River. Contributing to the fuselage damage and resulting unavailability of the aft slide/rafts were (1) the Federal Aviation AdministrationÂs approval of ditching certification without determining whether pilots could attain the ditching parameters without engine thrust, (2) the lack of industry flight crew training and guidance on ditching techniques, and (3) the captainÂs resulting difficulty maintaining his intended airspeed on final approach due to the task saturation resulting from the emergency situation. Contributing to the survivability of the accident was (1) the decision-making of the flight crewmembers and their crew resource management during the accident sequence; (2) the fortuitous use of an airplane that was equipped for an extended overwater flight, including the availability of the forward slide/rafts, even though it was not required to be so equipped; (3) the performance of the cabin crewmembers while expediting the evacuation of the airplane; and (4) the proximity of the emergency responders to the accident site and their immediate and appropriate response to the accident.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NTSB/AAR-10/03 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   NTSB  Canada geese caused plane to ditch in Hudson (Sunday Independent, 18-1-2009)   Location  Images: photo (c) Janis Krums; Hudson River; 15 January 2009; (CC:by) photo (c) bmunch was bunglemunch; Hudson River; 16 January 2009; (CC:by-nc-sa) photo (c) bmunch was bunglemunch; Hudson River; 16 January 2009; (CC:by-nc-sa) photo (c) David Daoust; Jersey City, New Jersey; 17 January 2009; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) David Daoust; Jersey City, New Jersey; 17 January 2009; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) David Daoust; Jersey City, New Jersey; 17 January 2009; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) David Daoust; Jersey City, New Jersey; 18 January 2009; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) David Daoust; Jersey City, New Jersey; 18 January 2009; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) Joseph Hoetzl; Jersey City, New Jersey; 25 January 2009; (CC:by-nc) photo (c) EeSLee; Jersey City, New Jersey; 31 January 2009; (CC:by) photo (c) www.quintanomedia.com; Little Ferry, New Jersey; 31 January 2009; (CC:by) photo (c) NTSB; Jersey City, New Jersey; 18 January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Jersey City, New Jersey; January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Jersey City, New Jersey; January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Jersey City, New Jersey; January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Jersey City, New Jersey; January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Jersey City, New Jersey; January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Jersey City, New Jersey; January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Jersey City, New Jersey; January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Jersey City, New Jersey; January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Jersey City, New Jersey; January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Miami International Airport, FL (MIA/KMIA); March 2001 photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Phoenix-Sky Harbor International Airport, AZ (PHX/KPHX); October 2006 photo (c) Sergio Cardona; New York-La Guardia Airport, NY (LGA/KLGA); 13 January 2009 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates19-Feb-2024 18:44 ASN Updated [Damage, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

During the missed approach, the aircraft struck a tree. The crew continued the missed approach and returned for a landing at Island Lake without further incident. No injuries were reported. The aircraft sustained damage to the wing leading edge and underside, and to its landing gear doors. FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1. The crew conducted an Area Navigation (RNAV) approach for which they were not trained, with an aircraft that was not properly equipped nor approved for such purpose. 2. The aircraft descended 300 feet below the minimum descent altitude (MDA) as a result of a number of lapses, errors and adaptations which, when combined, resulted in the mismanaged approach. 3. The aural warning on the aircraft's altitude alerter had been silenced prior to the approach, which precluded it from alerting the crew when the aircraft descended below minimum descent altitude. 4. The SkyNorth standard operating procedures for conducting a non-precision approach were not followed, which resulted in the aircraft descending below the minimum descent altitude.

Weather at Lubbock was poor with an overcast at 500 feet, freezing drizzle and mist. The aircraft encountered icing conditions while en route to Lubbock. And although the airplane accumulated some ice during the flight that degraded its performance, the NTSB determined that the aircraft could have landed safely had the airspeed been maintained.  During the approach to Lubbock runway 17R, at about 1400 feet above the ground and about 90 seconds from the runway, the captain indicated a flight control problem saying, ""We have no flaps."" Although the crewmembers had been trained to perform a go-around and refer to a checklist if a flap problem occurred during an approach, the captain chose to continue the approach as he attempted to troubleshoot the flap anomaly while the first officer flew the plane. Neither flight crewmember adequately monitored the airspeed, which decayed to the extent that the stick shaker activated, which warned of an impending aerodynamic stall.  The captain continued the unstabilized approach even though he received additional stick shaker activations and an aural ""pull up"" warning from the terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS). At that point, the plane was descending at a rate of over 2,000 ft per minute.  Although procedures for responding to either the stick shaker or the TAWS warning require the immediate application of maximum engine power, the captain did not apply maximum power until 17 seconds after the TAWS warning. Seconds after maximum power was applied, the airplane entered an aerodynamic stall and crashed. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the flight crew's failure to monitor and maintain a minimum safe airspeed while executing an instrument approach in icing conditions, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall at low altitude. Contributing to the accident were 1) the flight crew's failure to follow published standard operating procedures in response to a flap anomaly, 2) the captain's decision to continue with the unstabilized approach, 3) the flight crew's poor crew resource management, and 4) fatigue due to the time of day in which the accident occurred and a cumulative sleep debt, which likely impaired the captain's performance.""METAR: 09:53 UTC / 03:53 local time: KLBB 270953Z 01014KT 3SM -FZDZ BR OVC005 M08/M09 A3013 RMK AO2 PRESRR SLP227 P0000 T10781094=wind at 10 degrees, 14 kts, visibility 3 miles in mist and freezing drizzle, ceiling 500 feet overcast, temperature -7.8 deg C, dewpoint -9.4 deg C10:53 UTC / 04:53 local time: KLBB 271053Z 02011G18KT 2SM -FZDZ BR OVC005 M08/M09 A3013 RMK AO2 CIG 004V009 SLP228 P0000 T10781094=wind at 20 degrees, 11 kts gusting to 18 kts, visibility 2 miles in mist and freezing drizzle, ceiling 500 feet overcast, temperature -7.8 deg C, dewpoint -9.4 deg CAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NTSB/AAR-11-02 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   NTSB History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  21 January 1998 N15827 Continental Express 0 Hartford-Bradley International Airport, CT (BDL) sub Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport, TX (LBB/KLBB); January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport, TX (LBB/KLBB); January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport, TX (LBB/KLBB); January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport, TX (LBB/KLBB); January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport, TX (LBB/KLBB); January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport, TX (LBB/KLBB); January 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Houston-Intercontinental Airport, TX (IAH/KIAH); February 1993 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

After the nose ski cleared the snow, the left wing rose and the aircraft veered to the right and the captain, who was the pilot flying, continued the takeoff. The right ski, however, was still in contact with the snow. The aircraft became airborne briefly as it cleared a deep gully to the right of the runway. The aircraft remained in a steep right bank and the right wing contacted the snow-covered ground. The aircraft flew through a chain link fence and crashed into trees surrounding the airport. The five passengers and two crewmembers evacuated the aircraft with minor injuries. There was a small fire near the right engine exhaust that was immediately extinguished by the crew. FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1. Contamination on the wings of the aircraft was not fully removed before take-off. It is likely that asymmetric contamination of the wings created a lift differential and a loss of lateral control. 2. Although the operator was not authorized for short take-off and landing (STOL) take-off on this aircraft, the crew conducted a STOL take-off, which reduced the aircraft's safety margin relative to its stalling speed and minimum control speed. 3. As a result of the loss of lateral control, the slow STOL take-off speed, and the manipulation of the flaps, the aircraft did not remain airborne and veered right, colliding with obstacles beside the ski strip. FINDINGS AS TO RISK 1. The out of phase task requirements regarding the engine vibration isolator assembly, as listed in the operator's maintenance schedule approval, results in a less than thorough inspection requirement, increasing the likelihood of fatigue cracks remaining undetected. 2. The right engine inboard and top engine mounts had pre-existing fatigue cracks, increasing the risk of catastrophic failure. OTHER FINDINGS 1. The cockpit voice recorder (CVR) contained audio of a previous flight and was not in operation during the occurrence flight. Minimum equipment list (MEL) procedures for logbook entries and placarding were not followed. 2. The Transwest Air Limited safety management system (SMS) did not identify deviations from standard operating procedures.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A09C0017 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources: CADORS Number: 2009C0305 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  19 November 1969 VH-TGS TAA-Trans Australia Airlines 0 Marawaka sub 5 March 2006 C-FCCE Transwest Air 0 La Ronge Airport (CYVC), SK sub Location  Images: photo (c) TSB; La Ronge Airport, SK (YVC/CYVC); 04 February 2009 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The certified flight instructor (CFI) and the student pilot were not injured; the airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and wings from impact forces. The student pilot was performing the takeoff. During the takeoff roll on runway 30, the airplane began to drift to the right, and the student applied left rudder to correct for the drift. The CFI advanced the right throttle during the ground roll in an attempt to counteract the right yaw. The tail wheel came off the ground about 80 knots, and the airplane swerved to the right. The CFI applied left rudder in an attempt to stop the yaw and drift. As the airplane was about to depart the runway, the pilots did not reduce the throttles or apply brakes as they felt that it would be safer to attempt to get airborne. The airplane slowed as it departed the runway surface. It collided with a series of berms, which sheared off the left landing gear and left engine. The right landing gear collapsed, and the airplane came to rest in a nose down attitude. The operator stated that the student pilot inadvertently set the rudder trim to the full right position when he adjusted the rudder pedals during the prestart checks. The rudder trim was in the full right position for the takeoff, and found in the same position upon post accident inspection. The DC-3 involved was a turbine conversion and highly modified with a belly radar pod and chin FLIR turret. It was formerly operated by the South African Air Force as a maritime patrol aircraft. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The student pilot failed to follow the checklist and set the takeoff trim properly prior to takeoff resulting in a loss of directional control.

SAS Braathens flight 414 from Oslo Airport Gardermoen (ENGM) was approaching TromsÃ¸. During the descent, the fasten seatbelt sign was switched on at 15,000 ft in accordance with current company procedures. The cabin crew cleared and prepared the cabin. The aeroplane had descended to about 8 000 ft when it encountered clear airturbulence. The turbulence only lasted for a few seconds. One of the cabin crew at the back of the cabin had not had time to buckle up and lost her footing. She fell hard and broke her left ankle. The flight crew radioed air traffic control and informed them of the turbulence. It turned out that a warning had been issued for localised strong turbulence below 8,000 ft in the area in question (SIGMET). However, the alert was issued after the flight crew of SAS414 had planned their flight, and they had not received this information en route to TromsÃ¸. Normally, such information would have been communicated both by radio and via the aircraft's data link (Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System, ACARS).

Both pilots and 22 passengers were killed in the accident. Four passengers survived. The airplane had departed the Amazon city of Coari (CIZ) at 12:40 on a domestic flight to Manaus (MAO). About 13:10, while at FL115, the no. 1 engine flamed out. At 13:15 the crew made a contact with the Area Control Centre (ACC-AZ) reporting on descent for Manaus with twenty persons on board. In reality there were 28 occupants. The ACC controller instructed the crew to contact Manaus Approach Control. Subsequently, the pilot informed Manaus Approach that they would return to Coari. Contact was lost and at 13:24 radar contact was lost. The airplane came down in Rio Manacapuru. The airplane involved, an EMB-110P1, has a (certificated) maximum number of passenger seats of nineteen. On the accident flight 26 passengers had boarded the flight, including eight small children. Maximum takeoff weight for an EMB-110P1 is 5670 kg. The actual takeoff weight of the accident aircraft was 6414 kg. Contributing Factors 1 Human Factor 1.1 Medical Aspect It did not. 1.2 Psychological Aspect 1.2.1 Individual information 1.2.1.1 - Attitude - undetermined It is possible that the pilot's stated experience in this type of mission has influenced his permissive attitude towards situations contrary to what was predicted, raising his confidence in the ability to fulfill the mission, thus disregarding the risks involved. 1.2.1.2 - Culture of the working group - contributed There were no mass pilots conducting standardized procedures, such as briefing before and after each mission. They also showed an attitude of acceptance regarding the pilot's behavior not to carry out the intended procedures. Thus, attitudes were translated into informal rules of behavior in situations related to professional activity and safety. 1.2.2 Organizational Information 1.2.2.1 - Characteristics of the task - undetermined It is possible that the co-pilot took most of the flight preparation tasks in Coari, since it was customary for this to happen on missions with this commander. This may have interfered with the tasks under their responsibility, such as checking the number of people on board and giving passengers guidance on normal and emergency procedures. In addition, it is possible that the division of tasks relating to emergency procedures has been compromised, considering that some switches have been found in positions contrary to those recommended by the operations manual. 1.2.2.2 - Organizational Culture - contributed The company culture was reported as being focused on operational safety, however, in practice, what could be verified did not strengthen safe behaviors. Management did not supervise attitudes and did not control compliance with the procedures covered in the Operations Manual and in company training. There was a small participation of its crew members in prevention activities programmed by the company itself. 1.2.2.3 - Training, training and training - contributed There was no periodicity in training for emergency procedures. Despite the great experience of the commander, the lack of emergency training was present. Training of normal procedures, such as passing proper instructions to passengers, has also not been verified. 1.2.2.4 - Organization of work - contributed The procedures foreseen and established in the company's Operations Manual for operational safety were not applied, since the crew stopped transmitting the verbal instructions to the passengers, before takeoff and in the emergency situation. The crew made it possible to take off with excess weight and passengers, stopped communicating the emergency situation to the air traffic control agencies and allowed passengers to drink alcohol during the flight, facts that prove the accomplishment of the activities in an improvised way. 1.2.3 - Organizational processes - contributed 1.2.3.1 - Support systems - contributed Through the policy of granting total autonomy to the commander, the company was unaware of the decisions which, consequently, could affect the safety of the flight, as happened in relation to the refueling of the aircraft with less fuel And embark passengers in excess, thus demonstrating that there was no monitoring of activities in the operational scope. 1.2.3.10 - Other - contributed The blockage in the flow of information when the crew omitted information to Air Traffic Control and the lack of information to the passengers, during all the phases of the mission, made the assistance difficult in the face of the situation experienced, because if they had been The consequences could have been minimized. 1.3 Operational Aspect 1.3.1 Maintenance of the aircraft - contributed If the company's maintenance sector had performed the Oil Fuel Heater temperature check, it probably could have been verified that the thermal element had failed, which would lead to the replacement of the assembly, as recommended by the engine manufacturer's maintenance manual.

Both crew members were killed. The airplane was chartered to carry out a medical flight to Cagliari to pick up a patient for transplant surgery at Bologna. But first the jet had to be flown from its home base at Roma-Ciampino Airport to Bologna Airport (BLQ) to pick up a medical team. At 05:54, shortly before departed, Ciampino Tower cleared flight 301 for a PEMAR 5 ALFA Standard Instrument Departure. Following a right hand turn after takeoff from runway 15, the jet was to fly towards the coastline at a heading of approx 240Â°. The flight took off from runway 15 at 06:00. After contacting the Roma Radar controller, the crew were received clearance to ""fly direct to Bolsena, climb level 240, no speed restriction."" This meant that the crew could continue the right hand turn after takeoff to a heading of 336Â° for a direct course to Bolsena. About half way the turn was discontinued. The airplane climbed in a shallow left hand turn which progressively became steeper. Altitude was lost and the airplane struck terrain nose down. CAUSE (translated from Italian report): The cause of the accident was due to an impact with the ground resulting from the loss of control of the aircraft by the captain, who was also the PF. It appears very likely that during the initial phase inadequate attention was replaced by a phase of spatial disorientation, resulting in a loss of situational awareness, which prompted an inadquate intervention on the flight controls by the PF, resulting in total loss of control of the aircraft (having accentuated the tilt to the left wing, instead of leveling the aircraft). It is reasonable to assume that the PF, based on the conviction of being in a right turn for Bolsena in IMC night conditions, misinterpreted the unusual turn, using the controls in order to accentuate the bank angle to the left, drastically reducing the vertical component of lift. This turn has consequently caused the aircraft to assume an attitude of increasing bank, a condition that has been aggravated by the continued application on the controls of a positive load factor in order to stop the sudden loss of altitude, without first leveling the wings. Or the aircraft is stabilized in a pronounced downward spiral to the left. The first officer (PNF), engaged in the management of navigation equipment, has created the unusual turn of the aircraft in conjunction with the commander (PF). Nevertheless, the considerable gradient of experience on the airplane and hierarchy within the organization between the captain and the first officer has probably prevented him to intervene in a more directive or authoritative way in the recovery phase of the situation. Also contributing to the outcome of the event was the lack of detail in the definition of the duties of the crew procedures and inadequate adherence to the basic principles of CRM/MCC, with reference to the monitoring and statement of the navigation modes active, navigation procedures and in particular to the lack of requests for inclusion of turns and routes, the deficiency in the performance of controls and optimization of automation that can lighten the workload in a time unfavorable from the point of view of the circadian rhythm and IMC night. In this respect, it seems fitting to remember the problem of spatial disorientation, although known and studied for decades, is still relevant, and that the only way to counter it is the application of proper use of instruments in compliance with the basic principles of CRM/MCC, which should  be part of the normal operating procedures of an operator. This is especially true when working outside of normal circadian rhythms, when it is most easily seen a slowing of cognitive processes.METAR: 05:15 UTC / 06:15 local time: LIRA 070515Z 14018KT 9999 -RA FEW018 SCT030 BKN070 13/10 Q0992=wind 140 degrees at 18kts, light rain, few clouds 1,800 ft., scattered clouds 3,000 ft., broken clouds 7,000 ft., temperature 13Â°C, dew point 10Â°C, 992 mb05:45 UTC / 06:45 local time: LIRA 070545Z 16018KT 8000 -RA FEW014 SCT025 BKN070 13/11 Q0992=wind 160 degrees at 18kts, light rain, few clouds 1,400 ft., scattered clouds 2,500 ft., broken clouds 7,000 ft., temperature 13Â°C, dew point 11Â°C, 992 mbAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: ANSV Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: ANSV   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

En route the crew received information that it there was light snowfall at CDG. During the approach briefing the crew planned an ILS approach to runway 26L at 146 kt (Vref + 8 kt), full flaps, and autobrakes at medium. At 23:22 UTC (00:23 local time) the captain announced that the runway was in sight, as the aircraft was passes through a height of 240 feet. He then disconnected the autopilot. The aircraft was above the glideslope as the descent towards the runway was continued. After flying over the runway threshold at 85 ft, the captain began flaring at 40 ft. The aircraft touched down approximately 1050 m from the 26L threshold. Ground speed was 139 kt. With reversers selected at idle the crew noted that deceleration was not as expected. The captain then selected maximum reverse and began applying manual braking. At the end of the runway the captain steered the plane onto taxiway V1. At a ground speed of 41 knots the aircraft ran off the taxiway, coming to rest after 20 m. The left main gear and nose gear were damaged and deemed irreparable. The right main gear and 2 engine were also damaged. Causes of the accident: The accident was due to the continuation of landing when it touched down long and it was found that external conditions were more degraded than those previously reported to the crew. The following have contributed to the occurrence of this accident: - contamination of runway 08R/26L and degradation of the surface state (Rubber coating and deterioration of the surface) between 900 m and 300 m from THR 08R; - the erroneous determination of the runway 08R/26L conditions due to inadequate organization ground operations, monitoring the status of the platform in case of snow and maintenance of runways; - misinformation about the condition of the track, transmitted to the crew does not permit him to adopt the necessary measures; - non-use of thrust reversers.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Report number: f-aj090208 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Kazantzakis Airport (HER), Greece.  The airplane operated on a scheduled return flight between Heraklion and Rhodes. The entire return flight was uneventful until the landing back at Heraklion. The aircraft crossed the threshold with a speed of 112 kts and after flaring the captain, who was pilot flying, reduced speed to flight idle and touched down with a speed of 86 kts. As the speed was being gradually reduced, the captain had difficulty with controlling the aircraft along its longitudinal axis and noticing that the aircraft was leaning somewhat to the right, reported to the first officer that ""the gear has broken"". Immediately afterwards, the blades of the right propeller of the aircraft struck the runway. The aircraft continued to move with the left main landing gear wheel operating normally and the collapsed right main landing gear, folded backwards under the wing. The crew stopped the engines, reported to the Airport Control Tower that the right landing gear had broken and requested evacuation.  Investigation revealed that the forward yoke pintle on the right main landing gear fitted to SX-SKY failed on landing. The landing gear had flown 23,940 cycles since new and had been overhauled 148 landings prior to the accident. The aircraft landing weight was calculated to be 14,870 lb (6745 kg), which was within the maximum limit of 14,900 lb (6759 kg), and the FDR recorded a normal acceleration on landing of 1.79 g. A review of the data on the FDR identified two possible heavy landings of 2.5 g and 2.87 g that had occurred 5 and 27 landings prior to the accident.

The crash site was approximately 5 nautical miles northeast of the airport in Clarence Center, New York, and mostly confined to one residential house (6038 Long St, Clarence) . The four flight crew and 45 passengers were fatally injured and the aircraft was destroyed by impact forces and post crash fire. There was one ground fatality. Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.  Flight CJC3407 departed Newark-Liberty International Airport, NJ (EWR) at 21:20 on a domestic flight to Buffalo Airport, NY (BUF). At 22:15:14 the Buffalo Approach controller cleared the flight for an ILS approach to runway 23: ""Colgan thirty four zero seven three miles from klump turn left heading two six zero maintain two thousand three hundred till established localizer clear i l s approach runway two three."" The flight acknowledged that clearance. At 22:16:02, the engine power levers were reduced to flight idle. At that time Buffalo Approach instructed the crew to contact Buffalo Tower. The crew extended the landing gear and the auto flight system captured the ILS 23 localizer. The captain then moved the engine conditions levers forward to the maximum RPM position as the copilot acknowledged the instructions to Buffalo Tower.  At 22:16:28 the crew moved the flaps to 10Â°, and two seconds later the stall warning stick shaker activated. The autopilot disconnected at about the same time that the stick shaker activated. The crew added power to approximately 75% torque. The airplane began a sharp pitch up motion, accompanied by a left roll, followed by a right roll, during which the stick pusher activated. During this time, the indicated airspeed continued to decrease to less than 100 kts. Eight seconds after the flaps had been selected to 10Â°, and at an airspeed of less than 110 kts, the crew retracted the flaps. Sixteen seconds later the flaps were fully retracted. Following further pitch and roll excursions the airplane pitched down and entered a steep descent from which it did not recover. The airplane impacted a residential house and was destroyed. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the captainÂs inappropriate response to the activation of the stick shaker, which led to an aerodynamic stall from which the airplane did not recover.

CONCLUSIONS: Following a normal touchdown, the fracture of the nose landing gear main fitting allowed the nose gear to collapse rearwards and penetrate the lower fuselage, causing significant damage to the equipment bay and the battery to become disconnected. The penetration of the fuselage allowed smoke and fumes produced by the consequent release of hydraulic fluid to enter the cockpit and passenger cabin. With the battery disconnected and after the engines were shut down, all power to the aircraft PA systems was lost and the remote cockpit door release mechanism became inoperative. No pre-accident defects were identified with the manual cockpit door release mechanism or the PA system. The nose landing gear main fitting failed following the formation of multiple fatigue cracks within the upper section of the inner bore, originating at the base of machining grooves in the bore surface. These had formed because the improved surface finish, introduced by SB 146-32-150, had not been properly embodied at previous overhaul by Messier Services Inc, despite their overhaul records showing its incorporation. The operator had been in full compliance with the Service Bulletin relating to regular inspection of the main fitting, and embodiment of SB 146-32-150 at overhaul removed the requirement for these inspections by the operator.Sources: BA jobs go after plane write-off (BBC, 25 May 2009)  BA jet in airport 'hard landing' (BBC, 14 February 2009)   Location  Images: photo (c) AAIB; London City Airport (LCY/EGLC); February 2009 photo (c) Harro Ranter; Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS/EHAM); 22 February 2002; (CC:by-nc-nd) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The captain stated that while en route to Kotzebue, the weather at the airport dropped below VFR minimums, and he received a special VFR clearance. He said that the local area and runway were covered with snow, but when he turned final he could see the airport beacon and associated buildings. He said about 200 feet above the ground on approach he lost sight of the runway environment, and asked the first officer if he could see anything. When the first officer said no, and reported their altitude at 50 feet agl, the captain said he initiated a go-around, but the airplane impacted the terrain short of the runway. The captain reported that there were no known mechanical problems with the airplane or its instruments prior to the accident. The Director of Operations for the operator said the airplane sustained structural damage to the fuselage near the left main landing gear.  An Federal Aviation Administration flight service specialist at the airport said the visibility had been about 1-1/4 miles, but dropped to 1/4-mile rapidly during the time of the approach. Weather observations taken at the airport showed that about 3 minutes before the accident, the visibility was 1 mile in light snow and blowing snow, wind as 160 degrees at 28 knots gusting to 32. About 1 minute before the accident, the visibility was reported as 1/4-mile in light snow and blowing snow, wind from 160 degrees at 33 knots gusting to 36. About 3 minutes after the accident, the visibility remained at 1/4-mile in light snow and blowing snow, and the wind was reported as 170 degrees at 35 knots with gusts to 42.

The aircraft was previously owned by the Moldovian operator Aeriantur-M Airlines as ER-AXI. The airline ceased operations in January 2007 following an accident with one of its aircraft. It was subsequently sold to a private person and underwent C-check maintenance in the United Arab Emirates between March and May 2007. Meanwhile, in April. the Certificate of Airworthiness expired. There was information that the aircraft kept on flying in D.R. Congo. In 2008 Antonov was contacted to perform additional maintenance on the aircraft, which resulted in an agreement and a planned ferry flight in 2009. The aircraft certificate of temporary register in the state of Sao Tome as S9-SVN valid from 21 January 2009 until 20 February. A special flight permit was issued for a ferry flight valid till 20 February between Kisangani Airport, D.R. Congo Nikolaev Airport, Ukraine. The permit and the registration were for Aerolift Company Limited. The aircraft departed Kisangani and proceeded to Entebbe Airport, Uganda, and Luxor Airport in Egypt. After refuelling, the engines were started and the flight was cleared to taxi to runway 02 for departure. At 04:18 local time the aircraft began the takeoff roll. The aircraft failed to become airborne and continued rolling past the end of the runway into the sand. It crossed a service road and crashed into buildings in a military zone 500 meters from the runway end. After the accident numerous safety violations were discovered. The service life of the aircraft had expired and the Sao Tome authorities did not inspect the aircraft prior to issuing a temporary Certificate of Airworthiness and ferry permit.  The engines and propellers had reprinted numbers plates without documentation to confirm their service life or airworthiness. Additionally, the engines on the aircraft were of different types (AI-20M and AI-20K). The crew did not have enough time for rest. The decision of the crew to fly was influenced by the fact that the temporary certificate of airworthiness expired on 20 February, 2009. PROBABLE CAUSES OF THE ACCIDENT: - Lack of available thrust which corresponded to the power of only two engines running during take off run - Lack of authorized maintenance of the aircraft. - The uncoordinated crew actions in the critical situation (both pilots had previously flown as captains). The lack of coordination is confirmed by the braking trails left by the main landing gear at the end of RWY -02, based on FCOM instructions, and in case of rejected takeoff attempt, the crew had to set the throttles to idle, lower the nose gear to reach the runway and then use the propellers for braking (releasing them from the stops). Also, to reduce the roll and to maintain the direction they were to use the nose wheel steering and wheel brakes as well as emergency braking if needed. Actually the crew did neither of the above procedures, except using the main wheel brakes.METAR: 02:00 UTC / 04:00 local time: HELX 200200Z 17002KT CAVOK 14/01 Q1014 NOSIG=Wind 170 degrees, 2 kts, Ceiling unlimited, Sky clear, Temperature 14Â°C, Dewpoint 1Â°CAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: ECAA Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: Reuters  ukranews.com  ITAR-TASS   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

On board the aircraft was some cargo (a spare wheel, tools, etc.), with a total mass of 415 kg. The takeoff weight (5120 kg) and centre of gravity (26,3% MAC) were within limits. The airplane took off at 12:47 local time. About one minute after takeoff the crew reported that they were returning to the aerodrome of departure due to loss of engine power. The power was then lost almost completely, forcing the crew to carry out a forced landing in an agricultural field. This field contained deep slots, perpendicular to the direction of flight. On touchdown the left hand landing gear collapsed, along with the left hand wings. The reason for the loss of engine power in flight, most likely, was a reduction in the filing of the gasoline due to clogging of fuel filters. The appearance, structure and nature of the impurities found in the fuel on the aircraft were not characteristic of impurities accumulated in the fuel supply system in normal operating conditions. The source of the impurities in aircraft fuel system could not be found.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: - Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

When approximately one mile from the runway, the copilot decided to change the flight path to line up with the correct runway.  The pilot-in-command (PIC) reported that when the copilot rolled out on final approach, the airplane drifted to the right of the runway centerline.  The copilot began to correct the alignment; however, the airplane continued to drift right.  At 10 feet above the runway, the PIC instructed the co-pilot to perform a go-around.  The PIC stated that the right wing dropped and the right main tires settled on the runway during the go-around.  The copilot reported that the turn onto final approach was normal and that the airplane drifted slightly right of centerline when they crossed the airport boundary. The copilot reported that the winds were gusting out of the east (left side) during the landing.  The tower informed the flight crew that there was a white mist coming from their right tip tank.  Upon inspection the flight crew noticed fuel leaking from the right wing tip tank.  The airplane remained in the traffic pattern and then completed an uneventful landing.  The airplane sustained substantial damage to the outboard portion of the right wing.  Local winds reported 11 minutes prior to the accident were from 150 degrees at 6 knots, and 49 minutes after the accident the local winds were reported as being from 160 degrees at 5 knots.

Flight TK1951 departed Istanbul-AtatÃ¼rk International Airport (IST) for a flight to Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS), The Netherlands. The flight crew consisted of three pilots: a line training captain who occupied the left seat, a first officer under line training in the right seat and an additional first officer who occupied the flight deck jump seat. The first officer under line training was the pilot flying. The en route part of the flight was uneventful. The flight was descending for Schiphol and passed overhead Flevoland at about 8500 ft. At that time the aural landing gear warning sounded. The aircraft continued and was then directed by Air Traffic Control towards runway 18R for an ILS approach and landing. The standard procedure for runway 18R prescribes that the aircraft is lined up at least 8 NM from the runway threshold at an altitude of 2000 feet. The glidepath is then approached and intercepted from below. Lining up at a distance between 5 and 8 NM is allowed when permitted by ATC.  Flight 1951 was vectored for a line up at approximately 6 NM at an altitude of 2000 feet. The glide slope was now approached from above. The crew performed the approach with one of the two autopilot and autothrottle engaged.  The landing gear was selected down and flaps 15 were set. While descending through 1950 feet, the radio altimeter value suddenly changed to -8 feet. And again the aural landing gear warning sounded. This could be seen on the captainÂs (left-hand) primary flight display. The first officerÂs (right-hand) primary flight display, by contrast, indicated the correct height, as provided by the right-hand system. The left hand radio altimeter system, however, categorised the erroneous altitude reading as a correct one, and did not record any error. In turn, this meant that it was the erroneous altitude reading that was used by various aircraft systems, including the autothrottle. The crew were unaware of this, and could not have known about it. The manuals for use during the flight did not contain any procedures for errors in the radio altimeter system. In addition, the training that the pilots had undergone did not include any detailed system information that would have allowed them to understand the significance of the problem. When the aircraft started to follow the glidepath because of the incorrect altitude reading, the autothrottle moved into the Âretard flareÂ mode. This mode is normally only activated in the final phase of the landing, below 27 feet. This was possible because the other preconditions had also been met, including flaps at (minimum) position 15. The thrust from both engines was accordingly reduced to a minimum value (approach idle). This mode was shown on the primary flight displays as ÂRETARDÂ. However, the right-hand autopilot, which was activated, was receiving the correct altitude from the right-hand radio altimeter system. Thus the autopilot attempted to keep the aircraft flying on the glide path for as long as possible. This meant that the aircraftÂs nose continued to rise, creating an increasing angle of attack of the wings. This was necessary in order to maintain the same lift as the airspeed reduced. In the first instance, the pilotsÂ only indication that the autothrottle would no longer maintain the pre-selected speed of 144 knots was the RETARD display. When the speed fell below this value at a height of 750 feet, they would have been able to see this on the airspeed indicator on the primary flight displays. When subsequently, the airspeed reached 126 knots, the frame of the airspeed indicator also changed colour and started to flash. The artificial horizon also showed that the nose attitude of the aircraft was becoming far too high. The cockpit crew did not respond to these indications and warnings. The reduction in speed and excessively high pitch attitude of the aircraft were not recognised until the approach to stall warning (stick shaker) went off at an altitude of 460 feet.  The first officer responded immediately to the stick shaker by pushing the control column forward and also pushing the throttle levers forward. The captain however, also responded to the stick shaker commencing by taking over control. Assumingly the result of this was that the first officerÂs selection of thrust was interrupted. The result of this was that the autothrottle, which was not yet switched off, immediately pulled the throttle levers back again to the position where the engines were not providing any significant thrust. Once the captain had taken over control, the autothrottle was disconnected, but no thrust was selected at that point. Nine seconds after the commencement of the first approach to stall warning, the throttle levers were pushed fully forward, but at that point the aircraft had already stalled and the height remaining, of about 350 feet, was insufficient for a recovery. According to the last recorded data of the digital flight data recorder the aircraft was in a 22Â° ANU and 10Â° Left Wing Down (LWD) position at the moment of impact. The airplane impacted farmland. The horizontal stabilizer and both main landing gear legs were separated from the aircraft and located near the initial impact point. The left and right engines had detached from the aircraft. The aft fuselage, with vertical stabilizer, was broken circumferentially forward of the aft passenger doors and had sustained significant damage. The fuselage had ruptured at the right side forward of the wings. The forward fuselage section, which contained the cockpit and seat rows 1 to 7, had been significantly disrupted. The rear fuselage section was broken circumferentially around row 28. The Dutch Safety Board has reached the following main conclusion: During the accident flight, while executing the approach by means of the instrument landing system with the right autopilot engaged, the left radio altimeter system showed an incorrect height of -8 feet on the left primary flight display. This incorrect value of -8 feet resulted in activation of the Âretard flareÂ mode of the autothrottle, whereby the thrust of both engines was reduced to a minimal value (approach idle) in preparation for the last phase of the landing. Due to the approach heading and altitude provided to the crew by air traffic control, the localizer signal was intercepted at 5.5 NM from the runway threshold with the result that the glide slope had to be intercepted from above. This obscured the fact that the autothrottle had entered the retard flare mode. In addition, it increased the crewÂs workload. When the aircraft passed 1000 feet height, the approach was not stabilised so the crew should have initiated a go around. The right autopilot (using data from the right radio altimeter) followed the glide slope signal. As the airspeed continued to drop, the aircraftÂs pitch attitude kept increasing. The crew failed to recognise the airspeed decay and the pitch increase until the moment the stick shaker was activated. Subsequently the approach to stall recovery procedure was not executed properly, causing the aircraft to stall and crash.METAR: 09:25 UTC / 10:25 local time: EHAM 250925Z 20010KT 4500 BR SCT007 BKN008 OVC010 04/03 Q1027 TEMPO 2500=Wind 200 degrees, 10 kts, visibility 4500 m in mist, scattered clouds 700 ft., 	broken clouds 800ft, overcast 1,000 ft. temperature 4 deg.

The fire ignited combustible materials, including insulation blankets and spread upwards toward a flexible oxygen line mounted above the JB-1 junction box. The flexible oxygen line ignited when exposed to the fire, and the fire burned through the aircraft's fuselage. Evidence suggests that the fire initiated as a result of an electrical anomaly in the top portion of the JB-1 junction box, near bus bar and contactor components. This evidence includes melting of one side of the bus bar along the periphery of its connection to a terminal stud and severe thermal damage to the internal and, to a lesser degree, external surfaces of the K1XB contactor case. Despite the damage to the contactor case, the internal contacts did not appear to be stuck or exhibit signs of melting or excessive pitting. There were no other signs of arcing near any of these components. Numerous maintenance difficulties had occurred on the aircraft involving the external AC power supply system beginning approximately 10-weeks before the accident. To attempt to remedy the anomalies, several relays, electrical contactors, the AC power switch, the external ground power receptacle, and other electrical components were removed and replaced with new components. Several of these components were located in the upper section of the JB-1 junction box. The last of these actions occurred about 5-weeks before the accident. Probable Cause: An electrical anomaly in the top portion of the JB-1 junction box resulting in ignition of adjacent combustible materials, including insulation blankets, and a flexible oxygen line.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA09FA033 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates02-Mar-2009 09:47 harro Updated 16-Oct-2013 20:48 Anon.

A missed approach was performed and the air traffic controllers were informed accordingly. Having enough fuel on board, the aircraft entered a holding pattern. Several attempts to release the nose gear were made and a low pass over the runway was performed to check the nose landing gear position. This was confirmed from the ground to be in the up position and therefore an emergency landing was decided. The landing was done successfully. The aircraft stopped on the centerline axis shortly after the nose of the aircraft had touched the runway surface.  Passengers disembarked through the front passenger door. No passenger or crew member was injured. Causes of the accident:  (1) The accident was caused by blocking of the front landing gear of the plane in retracted position.  (2) Damage to the securing pin of the the piston damper of the front landing gear determined the blockage of the front wheel at a position rotated clockwise 10Â° of the axis of the aircraft.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIAS Report number: NR.

The right main gear would not extend in the down and locked position. The crew attempted a landing with the right main gear up and possibly hoped to free the gear to extend, however, this was unsuccessful and they subsequently elected to land gear up on their second approach. The aircraft landed successfully on its belly and came to a stop on the runway. The aircraft landed between Taxiways P and Q and all 10 occupants were evacuated and were transported to the hospital as a precaution. There were no obvious injuries and there was no fire after landing. The aircraft sustained substantial damage to its propellers, flaps and aft belly area. Inspection by TSB indicated that the inboard right main landing gear door partially hung up on the wheel well structure, preventing the extension of the landing gear. The reason for the gear door interference is under investigation. This aircraft was involved in an unsafe gear incident the previous day at Winnipeg. FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1. The right inboard landing gear door was incorrectly rigged, which reduced the clearance between the tire and gear door during gear extension. The mis-rigged landing gear door likely went unnoticed through four separate inspections. 2. The combined effect of the mis-rigged gear door, the installation of a new re-capped tire with large dimensions, growing free play in the gear door bushings/linkage arrangement, and air loading on the gear door reduced clearances sufficiently that the number three tire caught on a ledge on the inboard door skin, preventing the right main gear from extending.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A09C0028 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: CADORS Number: 2009C0523  CADORS Number: 2009C0528 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  27 January 2025 C-FSLZ Perimeter Aviation 0 5 nm S of Norway House unk Fumes/smoke/odor event Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All three crew members were killed. The Saras airplane was scheduled for carrying out test flight no 49, which would include inflight engine shut down and relight procedure at 10000 feet AMSL.  The aircraft took-off from Bangalore-Hindustan Airport (BLR) at 14:55. The flight was cleared to flight level 100. After completing general handling checks at 9000ÂAMSL without any events, a single engine simulated approach was carried out on runway 09. At about 15:11 the crew were cleared to perform an overshoot.  The crew contacted the Bangalore Radar controller, who cleared them back to FL100 and proceed to sector Southwest 2 for carrying out the engine relight test procedure. The crew reported reaching 9000ÂAMSL in sector Southwest at about 15:18.  The no. 1 engine was then shut down and secured following the test procedure at about 15:31. After about 47 seconds, the no. 1 engine relight procedure was initiated at around 9200ÂAMSL. After a successful left engine shut down and its securing procedure, at about 15:31 left engine relight procedure was initiated at about 9200ÂAMSL. The propeller blade pitch was selected from feathered to fine. This led to an increased in propeller rpm from 5 to 55%. Side slip increased up to 28 degrees and bank angle changed from 8 deg right to 70 degrees left. The pitch attitude was seen reaching -42 degrees. Propeller rpm continued to increase to 91%. Then the aircraft went into a sudden dive from 9200Â to 7300Â for about 13 secs. The aircraft was brought under control at this altitude. The crew continued their attempt to relight the engine but this was not successful. Meanwhile the side slip remained at 22 degrees with a pitch attitude of about -15 deg. The speed remained at 130 kt and altitude reduced from 7000 feet to 5200 feet. A second relight attempt was successful but the airplane was still in a rapid descent passing 4800 feet. Rudder pedal forces increased to as high as 90 kg with aileron forces raising to 40 kg. The crew were not able to fully control the airplane and arrest the descent. It impacted the ground. The aircraft was completely destroyed due impact and fire. PROBABLE CAUSE(S): Incorrect relight procedure devised by the designer and adopted by the crew at insufficient height leading to rapid loss of altitude and abnormal behavior of aircraft resulted into accident. Contributory factors: a) Lack of crew coordination and cockpit procedures b) Handling of the controls c) Non-aborting of flight by the crew in coordination with the flight test Director after failure of first relight attempt. d) Devising engine relight procedures by NAL without consulting the propeller manufacturer.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: DGCA India Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NAL Saras crashes at Bangalore - crew dead (Bangalore Aviation 6-3-2009)   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The co-pilot was the handling pilot for the sector. During the approach to runway 25L, the weather conditions at the airport were reported as wind 200 degrees at 20 knots, visibility 1,500 meters, and rain. Based on this information, the captain decided to take over control from the co-pilot for the landing. The captain later reported that he had the runway in sight passing through 1,000 feet on descent, so disengaged the auto pilot at 400 feet. At about 50 feet the aircraft drifted to the right and the captain initiated corrective action to regain the centreline. The aircraft touched down to the left of the runway 25 centerline and then commenced to drift to the right. The captain reported that he immediately commenced corrective action by using thrust reverser, but the aircraft increasingly crabbed along the runway with the tail to the right of runway heading.

The mishap aircraft terminated its mission and returned to Al Udeid Air Base, Qatar. The crew and mission personnel evacuated the aircraft safely without injury. The mishap occurred during operations in the Area of Responsibility (AOR). The mishap crew had begun aerial refuelling with a KC-135, when the mishap crew and personnel aboard heard and felt a loud bang throughout the midsection of the aircraft. The crew suspended refuelling to evaluate the aircraft to checkout their systems and evaluate the aircraft for any damage. Finding nothing apparently wrong, the crew re-latched to the tanker and attempted to continue the refuelling when another series of loud noises and vibrations were heard and felt throughout the aircraft. Personnel aboard the KC-135 observed a stream of vapour and fuel streaming from the E-8 and alerted the crew. The crew checked for damage through a rear window and observed fuel streaming from at least two holes in the left wing, just inboard of the number two engine. The crew opted to terminate the mission and return to Al Udeid. Maintenance personnel then examined the airplane and found that the number two main fuel tank had ruptured, causing extensive damage to the wing of the airplane. The Accident Investigation Board (AIB) President found, by clear and convincing evidence, that the mishap was caused when a civilian subcontractor employee inadvertently left a test plug in the fuel vent system of the Mishap Aircraft during recently completed Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM) performed on the MA. Additionally, the AIB President found by substantial evidence three factors which contributed to the mishap. First, the PDM subcontractor employed ineffective tool control measures. Second, the PDM subcontractor failed to follow Technical Order (TO) mandated procedures when employing the fuel vent test plug during PDM. Third, due to the relatively short period of time between takeoff and refuelling, the crew did not have the opportunity to burn a substantial amount of fuel from the number two fuel tank which could have allowed the dive ""flapper"" valve to open after the tanks excessive air pressure decreased to the point where the flapper valve would open. This explains why this mishap did not occur during ARs conducted between the time the MA left the PDM facility and the time of the mishap.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: USAF AIB Report number: Executive summary report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Scramble 402  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

The flight crew aborted the takeoff as the airplane was accelerating through 80 knots. Upon exiting the runway, the flight crew verified normal operation of both engines. The captain reported that he had no reason to suspect hot brakes due to minimal use and taxied back to the active runway where the flight was subsequently cleared for takeoff. During the second takeoff, which was initiated about 5 minutes and 43 seconds after the initial rejected takeoff, the flight crew heard and felt a loud bang followed by a sudden yaw to the right; the flight crew immediately aborted the takeoff. Shortly after, the flight crew heard a second loud bang, followed by a more severe yaw to the right. The flight crew slowed the airplane and exited onto a taxiway at the end of the runway. Upon exiting the airplane, the captain observed a fire near the left main landing gear and immediately evacuated the airplane. Examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed that the left main landing gear exhibited fire damage and that the tire was blown. A punctured hole within the right side of the fuselage was observed just aft of the cockpit. The flight crew reported that at the time of the accident the airplane weighed 20,772 pounds. Review of emergency procedures within the aircraft flight manual revealed that a high energy stop inspection of the aircraft was required following the initial rejected takeoff due to the aircraft exceeding the maximum brake energy weight at the time of the initial rejected takeoff. The maximum brake energy weight was calculated to be 20,300 pounds. Probable Cause: The flight crew's failure to follow the manufacturerâs aircraft flight manual emergency procedures following a rejected takeoff that required a high energy stop inspection. Contributing to the accident was the flight's exceedence of the aircraft's maximum brake energy weight.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: WPR09LA151 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates18-Mar-2009 11:59 harro Added 18-Mar-2009 12:03 harro Updated 21-Dec-2016 19:25 ASN Update Bot Updated [Time, Damage, Category, Investigating agency, ]01-Dec-2017 12:16 ASN Update Bot Updated [Cn, Operator, Other fatalities, Nature, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The takeoff was planned as a reduced-power takeoff and the first officer was the handling pilot for the departure. At 22:31:53, the captain called for the first officer to rotate. The first officer attempted to rotate the aircraft, but it did not respond immediately with a nose-up pitch. The captain again called 'rotate' and the first officer applied a greater nose-up command. The nose of the aircraft was raised and the tail made contact with the runway surface, but the aircraft did not begin to climb. The captain then selected TOGA on the thrust levers, the engines responded immediately, and the aircraft commenced a climb. The crew notified air traffic control of the tail strike and that they would be returning to Melbourne. While reviewing the aircraftÂs performance documentation in preparation for landing, the crew noticed that a takeoff weight, which was 100 tonnes below the actual takeoff weight of the aircraft, had inadvertently been used when completing the takeoff performance calculation. The result of that incorrect takeoff weight was to produce a thrust setting and takeoff reference speeds that were lower than those required for the actual aircraft weight. The aircraft subsequently landed at Melbourne with no reported injuries. The tail strike resulted in substantial damage to the tail of the aircraft and damaged some airport lighting and the instrument landing system. As a result of the accident, the aircraft operator has advised the Australian Transport Safety Bureau that it is reviewing a number of procedures including human factors involved in takeoff performance data entry. CONTRIBUTING SAFETY FACTORS: - The first officer inadvertently entered the incorrect take-off weight into the electronic flight bag to calculate the take-off performance parameters for the flight. - The captain was distracted while checking the take-off performance figures in the electronic flight bag, which resulted in him not detecting the incorrect take-off weight. - During the pre-departure phase, the flight crew did not complete all of the tasks in the standard operating procedures, which contributed to them not detecting the error. - When conducting the loadsheet confirmation procedure, the first officer called out 362.9 tonnes as the FLEX take-off weight, rather than the 262.9 tonnes that was recorded on the master flight plan, which removed an opportunity for the captain to detect the error. - The first officer changed the first digit of the FLEX take-off weight on the master flight plan during the loadsheet confirmation procedure, believing it had been transcribed incorrectly, which removed an opportunity for the flight crew to detect the error. - The lack of a designated position in the pre-flight documentation to record the green dot speed precipitated a number of informal methods of recording that value, lessening the effectiveness of the green dot check within the loadsheet confirmation procedure.

The range of CAS fluctuation was from 152 to 180 kt which was 12 kts slower and 16 kts faster than the selected approach speed of 164 kts. This exceeded the stabilized approach criteria. The pilot monitoring called ""stabilize"" and most likely let the pilot flying continue approaching, disregarding airspeed deviation of more than Vapp plus 10 kt.  The autopilot was disconnected at 198 ft radio altitude, while the autothrottle remained engaged. The pitch angle then decreased from 1.4Â° while the CAS was 178.5 kts. The airplane was almost on the glide slope at this point. Just after the autopilot was disconnected, the pitch angle temporarily decreased as low as 0.4Â° but it increased to 3.5Â° by the time the airplane descended to 92 ft.  In the meantime, the CAS decreased as low as 154 ft (Vapp minus 10 kt) and the airplane descended about half a dot below the glide slope. It is highly probable that this large speed decrease stemmed from the inability of the autothrottle system to counteract the large wind velocity change (decreasing head wind component) during the descent and the fact that the thrust was kept at idle during the increment of the pitch angle to 3.5Â°. The increased pitch angle and corresponding column input indicates the pilot flying's intention to correct the lowered flight path.  The CAS increased to 161 kt from 154 kt, but it was still slower than Vapp (164 kt). The deviation from the glide slope had increased to -1.11 dot.  The pilot flying began correcting the heading to correct for the cross wind component from the left and align the longitudinal axis with the runway centerline.  When the radio altimeter indicated about 48 ft, the pitch angle was 1.1Â° and a sink rate was about 13 fps. The autothrottle was engaged, and the thrust levers were in the retard mode which started to automatically decrease the thrust below 50 ft, reaching idle when descending through 20 ft.  The pilot flying initiated the flare later than usual at 20 ft, not at 30 ft. Rapid and large column input during flare indicates the pilot's recognition of the late flare. The pitch angle remained 1.1Â° (about 2Â° lower than usual) until the flare, and the pitch angle temporarily decreased to 0.7Â° (below 20 ft) followed by the quick increment of the pitch angle to 4.6Â° in 2 seconds before touchdown.  The control column was pushed largely forward (-4.9Â°) just before the touchdown. The airplane consequently experienced a large sink rate upon the first touchdown as high as 7 fps. Vertical acceleration spiked to 1.63 G and the airplane bounced. The forward control column input just before and during the touchdown most likely resulted in the rapid derotation from 4.6Â° at the first touchdown to below zero in 1.5 seconds. The decreasing pitch angle, with the main landing gear still in the air, may have made it difficult for the pilot flying to recognize the need for bounce recovery due to his lowering eye point. It may be possible that he didn't realize the airplane had bounced. The airplane then touched down on the nose landing gear with a pitch angle of -1.8Â°, followed later by the main landing gear. After touchdown the nosegear rebounded off quickly increasing the pitch angle, leading to increased lift, resulting in a high bounce to 16 ft above the runway.  The nose dropped again and the airplane landed on the nosegear followed by the main landing gears. As the airplane was rolling to the left, the left main gear first touched down, followed by the center landing gear and the right main gear. The recorded vertical acceleration at this time was 3.06 G. The airplane sink rate was estimated to be 21.5 fps at the third touchdown. It is highly probable that the airplaneÂs kinetic energies at the third touchdown exceeded the certification requirements by almost seven times.  The left wing attachment point to the fuselage fractured. The fuselage rolled to the left with the lift generated by the right wing and a fire erupted. The airplane rolled inverted and was consumed by fire. PROBABLE CAUSES: In this accident, when the airplane landed on Runway 34L at Narita International Airport, it fell into porpoising. It is highly probable that the left wing fractured as the load transferred from the left MLG to the left wing structure on the third touchdown surpassed the design limit (ultimate load).  It is highly probable that a fire broke out as the fuel spillage from the left wing caught fire, and the airplane swerved left off the runway rolling to the left and came to rest inverted on the grass area.  The direct causes which the airplane fell into the porpoise phenomenon are as follows:  a. Large nose-down elevator input at the first touchdown resulted in a rapid nose-down motion during the first bounce, followed by the second touchdown on the NLG with negative pitch attitude. Then the pitch angle rapidly increased by the ground reaction force, causing the larger second bounce, and  b. The PF's large elevator input in an attempt to control the airplane without thrust during the second bounce.  In addition, the indirect causes are as follows:  a. Fluctuating airspeed, pitch attitude due to gusty wind resulted in an approach with a large sink rate,  b. Late flare with large nose-up elevator input resulted in the first bounce and  c. Large pitch attitude change during the bounce possibly made it difficult for the crewmembers to judge airplane pitch attitude and airplane height relative to the ground (MLG height above the runway).  d. The PM's advice, override and takeover were not conducted adequately.  It is somewhat likely that, if the fuse pin in the MLG support structure had failed and the MLG had been separated in the overload condition in which the vertical load is the primary component, the damage to the fuel tanks would have been reduced to prevent the fire from developing rapidly.  It is probable that the fuse pin did not fail because the failure mode was not assumed under an overload condition in which the vertical load is the primary component due to the interpretation of the requirement at the time of type certification for the MD-11 series airplanes.METAR: 21:00 UTC / 06:00 local time: RJAA 222100Z 30013G28KT 260V330 9999 FEW020 13/M01 Q0998 NOSIG21:00 UTC / 06:00 local time: RJAA 222100Z 30013G28KT 260V330 9999 FEW020 13/M01 Q0998 NOSIG RMK 1CU020 A2948 21:08 UTC / 06:08 local time: RJAA 222108Z 31025G35KT 9999 FEW020 12/M01 Q0998 RMK 1CU020 A294921:30 UTC / 06:30 local time: RJAA 222130Z 32026G40KT 9999 FEW020 12/M02 Q0999 WS R34L NOSIG21:30 UTC / 06:30 local time: RJAA 222130Z 32026G40KT 9999 FEW020 12/M02 Q0999 WS R34L NOSIG RMK 1CU020 A2952 P/RR21:30 UTC / 06:30 local time: RJAA 222130Z 32026G40KT 9999 FEW020 12/M02 Q0999 WS R34L NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: JTSB Report number: AA2013-4 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: Kyodo, Asahi  JTSB History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  19 May 1999 N813DE Delta Air Lines 0 Cambridge Airport, Teversham, Cambridge sub Tailstrike Location  Images: photo (c) JTSB; Tokyo-Narita Airport (NRT/RJAA); 23 March 2009 photo (c) JTSB; Tokyo-Narita Airport (NRT/RJAA); 23 March 2009 photo (c) JTSB; Tokyo-Narita Airport (NRT/RJAA); 23 March 2009 photo (c) JTSB; Tokyo-Narita Airport (NRT/RJAA); 23 March 2009 photo (c) JTSB; Tokyo-Narita Airport (NRT/RJAA); 23 March 2009 photo (c) JTSB; Tokyo-Narita Airport (NRT/RJAA); 23 March 2009 photo (c) Harro Ranter; ZÃ¼rich-Kloten Airport (ZRH/LSZH) [HB]; 03 August 2002 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All six crew members were killed. The flight departed Jayapura (DJJ) on an scheduled cargo/passenger flight to Wamena (WMX). The airplane carried staples such as rice and flour. The crew consisted of a captain, co-pilot, engineer, loadmaster and two flight attendants.  The aircraft was being operated under the instrument flight rules (IFR) for the sector from Sentani, and a visual descent, approach and landing at Wamena, because there was no published instrument approach procedure at Wamena. There was low cloud with a base of 300 meters on the final approach track to runway 15 at Wamena. The aircraft tracked parallel to, and to the right of the extended runway 15 centreline. During that approach, and while descending through 6,234 feet (790 feet by radio altimeter), the EGPWS voice aural alert 'TERRAIN TERRAIN' sounded. When the aircraft was passing 6,200 feet (991 feet by radio altimeter) on descent, the EGPWS voice aural alert 'WHOOP WHOOP, PULL UP' sounded. The aircraft started turning left toward runway as it was passing 5,719 feet (540 feet radio altimeter) on descent. As the aircraft passed 5,693 feet (516 feet radio altimeter) on descent, the crew informed the controller that they had the runway in sight. During their attempt to intercept the final approach track, while passing 5,531 feet (320 feet radio altimeter) the captain commented to the copilot ""wah nembak lagi"" [we are overshooting again]. During the interception towards the runway an EGPWS voice aural alert 'SINK RATE', sounded. This was immediately followed by the voice aural alert 'WHOOP WHOOP, PULL UP' sounding five times. The copilot instructed the captain ""overshoot, overshoot"" after the second of the five 'WHOOP WHOOP, PULL UP' sounds. The FDR showed that the aircraft commenced a go around from a low height above the runway. The controller offered the crew a choice of a landing on runway 33, but the crew elected to make a right circuit for runway 15. The circuit was flown at a height of between 150 and 350 feet above the aerodrome elevation. During the downwind leg the EGPWS provided the flight crew with eight 'DON'T SINK' and one 'TOO LOW TERRAIN' voice aural alerts. The flight crew did not respond to any of those alerts. As the aircraft passed abeam the threshold of runway 15, the landing gear was lowered for the second landing approach. During the right base turn the aircraft was initially flown at a constant 30 degree angle of right bank. About 100 degrees from runway heading, the copilot said ""OK, sungai ketok"" [OK river in sight]. Four seconds later, when about 85 degrees from runway heading the copilot said ""Pike clear"" [Pike Hill visible]. As the aircraft's heading passed 65 degrees from the runway heading, the copilot called ""be careful pak"" [be careful sir]. A third person in the cockpit commented ""di kiri ada bukit"" [there is a hill on the left]. This was immediately followed, as the aircraft banked through 41 degrees right, by the copilot calling out with increasing concern, ""pak, pak, pak, open pak, kiri, kiri"" [sir, sir, sir, open, sir, left, left]. The engine power was rapidly increased immediately after the copilot called ""open pak"" [open sir]. The copilot commanded ""kiri pak""[left sir] as the captain rolled the aircraft into a left bank and the EGPWS voice aural alert 'DON'T SINK, DON'T SINK' sounded. As the bank angle exceeded 40 degrees, it entered a 10-degree nosedown pitch attitude. The copilot warned the captain ""don't sink"". The captain immediately responded ""ya, ya"". Three seconds later the copilot said ""left turn"". The EGPWS then sounded the following voice aural alerts in rapid succession: 'TOO LOW - TERRAIN', 'BANK ANGLE - BANK ANGLE', 'TERRAIN - TERRAIN'. At the same time as the EGPWS sounded the 'TERRAIN - TERRAIN' warning, the copilot called with high intonation ""pak, pak, pak"" [sir, sir, sir]. The nose-down pitch attitude reached 6 degrees when the aircraft reached 49 degrees left bank. As the aircraft reached 49 degrees left bank, landing gear retraction commenced. The EGPWS voice aural alert then sounded TERRAIN, and one second later the copilot called ""pak"" [sir]. At the point of impact with the terrain, the landing gear was half way through the retraction cycle, the left bank was 16 degrees, and the aircraft pitch was 12 degrees nose up. The indicated airspeed at impact was 146 knots. The aircraft impacted Pikei Hill on Tengah Mountain.  Wamena Airport is situated at the Baliem Valley with an airport elevation of 5085 feet and surrounded by mountains up to 12.000 feet high. The only navigation aid available is NDB "" ZW"". The instrument approach procedure is not available for this aerodrome. This aerodrome is VFR operation only. CAUSES: The crew did not appear to have awareness of the aircraftÂs proximity with terrain until impact with terrain was imminent. The flight crew did not act on the Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System aural warnings, and did not conform to the operatorÂs published operating procedures. Together, those factors resulted in the aircraftÂs impact with terrain.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSC Report number: KNKT 09.12.04.01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Antara  Tempo Interaktif  Ministry of Transportation (Indonesia), press release History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  22 July 2008 PK-BRD Aviastar Mandiri 0 Jayapura-Sentani Airport (DJJ/WAJJ) Location  Images: photo (c) NTSC; near Wamena Airport (WMX/WAJW); April 2009 photo (c) NTSC; near Wamena Airport (WMX/WAJW); April 2009 photo (c) NTSC; near Wamena Airport (WMX/WAJW); April 2009 photo (c) NTSC; April 2009 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

One 6 year old boy died, and seven others were badly injured. The Aereotuy plane carried ten tourists on a flight to Ciudad BolÃ­var. During takeoff the airplane could not gain altitude, continued off the departure end, and collided with a powerline, 80 meters past the end of runway 36. Weather conditions at the time of the accident were poor due to cumulo nimbus clouds to the north of the airfield. There were puddles of water on the runway as a result of rainfall. Runway 36 is a 2100 m long asphalt runway. The airplane lined up for takeoff on the last third of the runway. Cause (translated from Spanish) The accident occurred as a result of the inability of the aircraft to take off, affected by the tailwind and water puddles that covered part of the runway, which did not allow speed to build up, crashing into the ground. It is considered that the most likely cause of the accident was mismanagement by the crew, in the sense of failing to make adequate planning and analysis, coupled with overconfidence and lack of identification of hazardous conditions at that time of takeoff. Based on our [JIAAC] investigations, we can infer that there were several contributing causes for the occurrence of this accident. In this order, we can state the following: - Adverse weather and tailwind conditions associated with the phenomenon. - Incorrect management by the crew to use only the last third of the runway with the meteorological conditions prevailing at that time. - Failure of the aerodrome administration to identify and correct poor drainage of the runway. - Failure of the Autoridad AeronÃ¡utica to monitor safety. - Rejection by the crew of the concatenated form in which the factors involved in this event developed. After all the analysis to different causes involved in this accident, we can point to as the main Causal Factor: Human Factor, due to the mismanagement by the flight crew upon takeoff in these conditions. Physical and Material factors included everything related to the prevailing weather conditions, road conditions and lack of services at the aerodrome by the authorities; all of them are considered Contributing Factors.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JIAAC Venezuela Report number: 025/2009 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: Rescate ORH  NTSB   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were no injuries to the 210 passengers or 10 crew members onboard but the airplane received substantial damage. During the initial approach, the flight encountered gusty wind conditions (16 knots gusting to 24 knots). As a result, the flight crew added an appropriate wind additive to the reference landing speed (Vref). The airplane touched down in the touchdown zone approximately 1,600 feet from the threshold with a recorded normal acceleration (Nz) consistent with a ""firm"" landing. As the main gear touched down, a full nose down column was applied that produced a very high nose-down pitch rate, which resulted in a hard nose gear touchdown. The recorded normal acceleration at nose gear touchdown was 1.8 g, however, the actual load applied at the nose gear was much higher because the accelerometers are located in the main gear wheel well. The peak nose gear load experienced at nose gear contact exceeded the design-limit load by as much as 46%. The recorded normal and pitch accelerations, calculated data, and estimated nose gear loads confirm that the aircraft experienced a bending moment that exceeded both the design requirements and the structural capability of the fuselage.

Thinking this was residual fuel, he 'spooled the engine.Ã¢â¬Â Realizing there was a fire, he called for assistance and shut off the fuel selectors and firewall shutoff valve. After the accident, a FAA inspector examined the airplane and reported extensive thermal damage to the fuselage sub-frame and evidence of an engine fire. Numerous engine turbine blades were found on the pavement adjacent to where the fire occurred. A disassembly and inspection of the engine revealed that one or more of the compressor turbine (CT) blades failed. The engine was overhauled about 6 hours prior to the accident. The CT blades were manufactured under the FAA Parts Manufacture Approval (PMA) program. Extreme heat damage obliterated the fracture surfaces of the blades, therefore the reason for the blade failure(s) could not be determined. A functional test of the fuel control unit (FCU) revealed the Sg (specific gravity) dome, high idle stop screw, and minimum flow stop were set above the recommended range, which would result in higher than normal fuel flow. The FCU adjustments appeared to be made after the overhaul, however it could not be determined when the adjustments occurred. Although the higher than normal fuel flow setting probably did not result in the CT blade failures, it could have exacerbated the thermal damage and fire. Probable Cause: A loss of engine power due to the failure of one or more compressor turbine blades for an undetermined reason.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA09LA269 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB ERA09LA269  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates03-Oct-2022 19:43 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

The crewmembers were likely focused on having the pilot flying (PF) achieve a successful flare, to the exclusion of monitoring other approach parameters. 2. The captain provided vague instructions on managing power during the approach and the resultant settings went unchecked, resulting in an undesirable descent rate close to the ground. 3.

The flight was a regularly scheduled passenger flight which departed from Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport, MN (MSP) at 11:39. The flight to the DEN area was reported as routine, with VFR weather prevailing. At about 12:02, as the flight was entering the DEN terminal area, the crew briefed an approach speed of 139 knots for a visual approach to runway 16L. The First Officer (FO) was the pilot flying (PF) and reported the approach was stable at 1,000 feet above the runway threshold. At 12:16:15 ATC cleared the flight to land and issued a wind advisory of 260 degrees at 5 knots. The flight crew extended the gear and selected flaps 3. The autopilot was disengaged at 12:17:38, at approximately 750 feet above touchdown. The auto-thrust and flight directors were engaged. During the approach, the crew noted that the aircraft was experiencing approximately 7 knots of tailwind, and as the approach progressed FDR data indicated the tailwind component increased to approximately 11 knots. As the airplane passed approximately 50 feet above touchdown the rate of descent was about 800 feet per minute (fpm). The captain stated he expected nothing more than a firm touchdown. The FO initiated the flare at about 45 feet. He stated that he attempted to arrest the sink rate with larger than normal aft stick deflection. During the flare, passing 20 feet above the runway, the automated ""retard"" call-out began a sequence of three annunciations. This automatic call-out is designed to remind the pilot to move the thrust levers to the idle detent. The thrust levers remained in the climb detent (CLB). During the flare, the airplane pitched up to about eight degrees nose up and airspeed decreased to about 132 knots. The airplane touched down on both main landing gear with a vertical load of about 1.56 G. At the time of initial touchdown, the thrust levers were still in CLB, and engine N1 increased from approximately 54% to 64% over 3 seconds. Radio altimeter values increased, indicating the aircraft then bounced. The FO held 16 degrees aft stick input (approximately full aft travel), and moved the thrust levers to idle during the bounce. Ground spoilers deployed (thrust lever position and wheel spin up logic was satisfied) and the airplane touched down a second time in an eleven degree nose up attitude, with FO still applying full aft stick input. At this point the captain began adding some nose down stick input however pitch attitude continued increasing to about 12.5 degrees nose up. The Airbus FCOM indicates that the max pitch up angle with gear compressed is 11.7 degrees. A ""dual input"" automatic call-out was recorded, indicating the system detected both pilots making stick inputs, and the sound of a loud bang was heard on the cockpit voice recorder. As the captain stick input moved further forward, in the airplane nose down direction, and the FO stick back pressure relaxed, the airplane began to pitch downward and about 3 seconds after the loud bang the nose wheel touched down. Thrust levers were then moved to the reverse position and autobraking began. The remainder of the roll out was normal. The aircraft experienced heavy abrasions, dents and perforations of the skin along the lower rear fuselage between frames 62 and 76. Additionally, the aft galley drain mast and two aircraft antennas were broken, and the APU air intake sustained damage. The rear pressure bulkhead damage was buckled and cracked. The lower segment of frame 70 was cracked and had heavy abrasions. Interior damage also consisted of minor deformation of frames, damage to stringers, frame clips, fasteners, floor support strut fittings and flange. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The first officerÂs excessive pitch-up of the airplane while landing with a tailwind, which resulted in a tailstrike following a bounced landing. Contributing to the bounced landing were a high descent rate and excessive thrust resulting from the first officerÂs delay in retarding the thrust levers to idle, thereby providing residual thrust and preventing spoiler deployment.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA09FA047 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  NTSB accident docket   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Denver International Airport, CO (DEN/KDEN); May 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Denver International Airport, CO (DEN/KDEN); May 2009; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Denver International Airport, CO (DEN/KDEN); May 2009; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The seven crew members escaped unhurt. The airplane operated on a repositioning flight from Jeddah. During the flight, the captain discussed the use of manual spoilers during landing with the first officer. He further stated that; as he ""had only around 400 hours in the aircraft"" as a captain, he wanted to ""see the effect' of landing with manual spoilers. He further explained that the flight provided an opportunity to ""do it manually"" (use manual spoilers) as it was a repositioning flight and, the weather and dry runway conditions were ideal. As such, he discussed the procedure with the first officer and elected to land with the auto ground spoiler system unarmed. The flight was uneventful. During the approach to Riyadh the Landing Checklist was completed, which included the arming of the auto ground spoiler system for landing. After the Landing Checklist was completed, the captain disarmed the auto ground spoiler system with the intention of applying manual ground spoilers after landing. The auto braking system was also not armed prior to landing. The final approach and touchdown to runway 15 Left at Riyadh were uneventful. The touchdown airspeed was 135 knots calibrated air speed (CAS).  On touchdown, the captain manually extended the spoiler/speed brake lever, but did not latch it in the fully extended (EXT) position (fully aft and latched upwards). The captain then removed his right hand from the speed brake lever in order to deploy the thrust reversers. The first officer noted the movement of the spoiler/speed brake lever and called ""Spoilers Deployed"".  Since the spoiler/speed brake lever was not fully pulled aft and latched upwards, the lever automatically returned to the forward retracted (RET) position. This movement of the spoiler/speed brake lever was not noticed by the captain and the first officer. In response, the ground spoilers re-stowed before being fully deployed and, a speed brake/flap configuration (SPD BRK/FLP CONFIG) Level 1 Amber Alert occurred. This alert occurred as the aircraft was not yet fully weight on wheels (WOW) and the aircraft still sensed a flight condition with speed brakes deployed and flaps extended beyond six degrees. Six seconds after touchdown on the right main landing gear, the nose gear touched down and the aircraft transferred to a ground condition (WOW on nose gear and main wheel spin up). The SPD BRK/FLP CONFIG alert extinguished when the nose gear oleo actuated ground shift on landing.  After touchdown, the aircraft banked to the right and began to drift right of the runway centerline. In response, he applied left rudder, deployed the thrust reversers and applied left aileron. But this did not have any noticeable effect. The captain saw the approaching G4 taxiway exit and in an attempt to keep the aircraft from leaving the runway surface beyond the G4 taxiway exit, he decided to direct the aircraft towards the taxiway. He then applied a right rudder input which caused the aircraft to commence a rapid sweeping turn to the right towards the G4 taxiway exit. The aircraft left the runway at high speed, traversed the full width of the G4 taxiway, and exited the surface at its southern edge. The aircraft then entered a sand section and travelled the distance infield between the edge of the G4 taxiway and the adjacent section of taxiway GOLF. The left main landing gear collapsed during this time. The aircraft came to rest on taxiway GOLF. There was no post impact fire. Cause Related Findings 1. The Captain decided to land with manual ground spoilers when the auto ground spoiler system was fully operational. 2. The initiative by the Captain to conduct this improvised exercise contravened the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and the Flight Operations Policy Manual (FOPM). 3. The auto ground spoiler system was disarmed prior to landing. 4. The spoiler/speed brake lever was partially applied manually after landing. 5. The spoiler/speed brake lever was released before it was fully extended and latched. 6. The spoiler/speed brake lever automatically retracted as per design. 7. The ground spoilers never fully deployed. 8. The loss of lift and aircraft deceleration were greatly reduced by the lack of ground spoiler deployment. 9. Brakes were not used in an attempt to control or slowdown the aircraft. 10. The Captain applied a large right rudder input with the intention of directing the aircraft onto the G4 taxiway exit. 11. The aircraft exited the runway at high speed and was travelling too fast to successfully negotiate the right turn onto the G4 taxiway.Sources: Accident Report Saudi Arabian Airlines - Flight SVA 9061 MD 90-30, Registration HZ-APW King Khaled International Airport - Riyadh Kingdom of Saudi Arabia / GACA   Location  Images: photo (c) Konstantin von Wedelstaedt; Dubai Airport (DXB/OMDB); 12 February 2005 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft took off from Panama-Albrook Marcos A. Gelabert International Airport (PAC) at 11:13 UTC (06:13 am local). The crew reported experiencing strong vibrations in the nose gear, and after landing at CorazÃ³n de JesÃºs (CZJ), the crew noted the same condition. Upon landing at the next destination, CartÃ­, the aircraft veered uncontrollably to the right, impacting the right wing against some bushes and the left wing against the ground, turning the aircraft 90 degrees to the right. CONCLUSIONS. The accident occurred as a result of an unstable approach. Upon contact with the runway, the left main landing gear touched down, and in trying to correct with the steering at a speed higher than controllable, the reaction was an adverse yaw. This caused overcorrection, leading the aircraft off the runway to the right side and through the brush, impacting various trees and bushes. Human error was the main cause for not utilizing a normal approach.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAC Panama Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: https://www.diaadia.com.pa/archivo/05172009/imp02.html Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates18-May-2009 10:35 harro Added 05-Feb-2011 12:02 TB Updated [Cn, ]18-Jan-2025 18:28 ASN Updated [Total occupants, Departure airport, Destination airport, Damage, Narrative, Accident report, ] Corrections or additions? ...

Magal Flight 100 departed Khartoum (KRT), Sudan at 07:38 with 13 tons of cargo on board, bound for Heglig, Sudan. The airplane touched down on the gravel, 16 meters short of the runway. It struck concrete blocks, runway lights and then bounced. It impacted the runway nose-first. The captain ordered the props to be unlocked so they would go into ground fine pitch. However, the throttle of engine no. 4 was still at 42% with the other engines below 20%. An asymmetric thrust condition occurred as the no. 4 engine consequently did not go into ground fine pitch. This caused the plane to drift to the left side. It passed over a gravel road, then lost the left main landing gear, turned to left and broke the right hand main landing gear and nose gear before it stopped.

The wreckage came to rest on the west bank of the Des Plaines River, in a forest preserve south of the airport. Both pilots were killed in the accident. The flight departed Pontiac-Oakland County International Airport, MI (PTK) at 13:35 and was scheduled to pickup cargo at Chicago-Executive Airport, IL (PWK). During the descent and 14 minutes before the accident, the airplane encountered a layer of moderate rime ice. The captain, who was the pilot flying, and the first officer, who was the monitoring pilot, made multiple statements which were consistent with their awareness and presence of airframe icing. After obtaining visual flight rules conditions, the flight crew cancelled the instrument flight rules clearance and continued with a right, circling approach to runway 34. While turning into the base leg of the traffic pattern, and 45 seconds prior to the accident, the captain called for full flaps and the engine power levers were adjusted several times between 50 and 95 percent. In addition, the captain inquired about the autopilot and fuel balance. In response, the first officer stated that he did not think that the spoilerons were working. Shortly thereafter, the first officer gave the command to add full engine power and the airplane impacted terrain. There was no evidence of flight crew impairment or fatigue in the final 30 minutes of the flight. The cockpit voice recorder showed multiple instances during the flight in which the airplane was below 10,000 feet mean sea level that the crew was engaged in discussions that were not consistent with a sterile cockpit environment, for example a lengthy discussion about Class B airspeeds, which may have led to a relaxed and casual cockpit atmosphere. In addition, the flight crew appears to have conducted checklists in a generally informal manner. As the flight was conducted by a Part 135 operator, it would be expected that both pilots were versed with the importance of sterile cockpit rules and the importance of adhering to procedures, including demonstrating checklist discipline. For approximately the last 24 seconds of flight, both pilots were likely focusing their attention on activities to identify and understand the reason for the airplane's roll handling difficulties, as noted by the captain's comment related to the fuel balance. These events, culminating in the first officer's urgent command to add full power, suggested that neither pilot detected the airplane's decaying energy state before it reached a critical level for the conditions it encountered.

The commercial pilot was not injured. The cross-country flight originated at Omaha-Eppley Airfield, NE (OMA). The pilot reported the airplane picked up light to moderate icing on approach and he cycled the de-icing boots once prior to the final approach fix. He said he was established on the instrument landing system (ILS) approach to runway 36 at 120 knots indicated airspeed, configured with gear and 30 degrees flaps, when he broke out of the weather about 250 feet above ground level (AGL). He estimated the approach brought the airplane 60 feet right of the runway centerline when he broke out of the weather, so he made a correction to align with the runway. He said when the airplane was wings level and about 25 feet above the runway ""the left wing stopped flying"" and the airplane landed hard on the left main landing gear.

The pilot diverted to the nearest airstrip, which was Beagle Bay, WA. The pilot shut the engine down when the low oil pressure warning light illuminated and conducted a landing at Beagle Bay airstrip. The aircraft overran the airstrip, coming to rest upside down after impacting a mound of dirt. The aircraft was seriously damaged. The pilot, who was the only occupant, sustained minor injuries. From the evidence available it was evident that the engine had a substantial in-flight oil leak, which necessitated the in-flight shut down of the engine and a diversion to the nearest available airstrip.  The accident damage to the engine in the area of the apparent oil leak precluded a conclusive finding as to the source of the leak. Although the detailed examination of the oil tube attachment lug fracture surfaces was inconclusive, the oil tube remained the most likely source of the oil leak. Evidence from other oil tube failures indicated that significant vibratory loading can cause the oil tube attachment lugs to fracture in the manner observed in the oil tube fitted to VH-NTQ. There was no evidence that the transfer tube was subjected to vibration from a compressor turbine or power turbine blade failure or  of an incorrectly fitted engine mount.

Bud Day Field (SUX), Iowa. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The pilot, copilot, and two passengers were uninjured. The pilot filed an instrument-flight-rules (IFR) flight plan with the destination and alternate airports, both of which were below weather minimums. The pilot and copilot departed from Des Moines Airport in weather minimums that were below the approach minimums for the departure airport. While en route, the destination airport's automated observing system continued to report weather below approach minimums, but the flight crew continued the flight. The flight crew then requested and were cleared for the instrument landing system (ILS) 31 approach and while on that approach were issued visibilities of 1,800 feet runway visual range after changing to tower frequency. During landing, the copilot told the pilot that he was not lined up with the runway. The pilot reportedly said, ""those are edge lights,"" and then realized that he was not properly lined up with the runway. The airplane then touched down beyond a normal touchdown point, about 2,800 feet down the runway, and off the left side of the runway surface. The airplane veered to the left, collapsing the nose landing gear.  The company's procedures did not allow flight crew to depart to an airport that was below minimums but did allow for the flight crew, at their discretion, to perform a ""look-see"" approach to approach minimums if the weather was below minimums. The allowance of a ""look see"" approach essentially negates the procedural risk mitigation afforded by requiring approaches to be conducted only when weather was above approach minimums.

At 12:40, flight CLX 793 contacted Luxembourg Approach (APP) for the first time and was advised by the approach controller that Low Visibility Procedures (LVP) were in operation.  Fog prevailed at Luxembourg airport with a cloud base at 100 feet overcast and a visibility of 100 meters, temperature and dew point were at 1Â°C.  The aircraft was cleared for an ILS approach on runway 24 at 12:49. RVR readings were 350/275/375 meters. At 12:50:55, CLX 793 reported established on the localiser for runway 24 and was transferred to Tower. RVR readings had decreased to 350/250/350 meters.  CLX 793 contacted Luxembourg Tower (TWR) at 12:51:40 and reported established on the ILS 24. The Tower Controller then cleared them to land.  At 12:53:46, reaching decision height at 17 ft, the Pilot Flying called out 'landingÂ. During the flare, the airplane impacted a maintenance van 'ELE 23' positioned slightly to the right of the centreline of runway 24 and about 340 meters from the threshold, with the front-end pointing into the opposite direction (060Â°). The roofline of the van was at a height of 2.54 m (8 ft). The right hand body landing gear of the Boeing 747-400F impacted the roof of ELE 23 with tire no. 12 slightly below the roofline of the van on a backward sloped roof section and rolled over it, damaging the roof on the whole length of the vehicle. The van's lightbar, as well as its R/T antennas, were ripped off on impact. The maintenance crew working on the centreline lights outside of ELE 23 ran off the side of the runway as soon as they noticed an increasing noise from a landing aircraft.  The aircraft landed safely at 12:53:51.  After touchdown, at 12:53:59, the Pilot Flying mentioned to the Pilot Monitoring (PM) that there was a car in the touchdown zone. The PM, monitoring the instruments during landing in accordance  with company procedures, didn't notice it.  The aircraft vacated runway 24 at taxiway Echo and at 12:56:28, while taxiing to apron P7, the PF informed the Tower controller about a car in the touchdown zone. The controller asked if there was a problem and the PF denied. The aircraft continued to the parking position on apron P7 without further incident. Causal and contributory factors:  - The impaired operational readiness of the ELE department due to a manning shortcoming, combined with the lack of provisions to appoint external workforce if necessary, prevented ANA to schedule preventive maintenance work outside of normal operating hours (i.e. during the curfew);  - The decision to carry out preventive maintenance work in low visibility conditions without hampering air traffic gave priority to flight operations over safety aspects;  - The lack of adequate co-ordination between aerodrome control tower and ELE department with regard to the preventive maintenance work contributed to a reduced situational and organizational awareness of the TWR control staff;  - Inadequate procedures for the access of vehicles to the RWY and ILS sensitive area during LVP contributed to the development of an unsafe condition;  - Read-back procedures were not adequately applied by aerodrome control tower on ground control frequency, making this procedural safety net ineffective;  - Low visibility weather conditions, associated with the lack of supplementary ground traffic control and surveillance equipment, limited the capability of aerodrome control tower to identify and correct a developing unsafe condition;  - The use of different frequencies for air traffic and ground traffic on the manoeuvring area reduced the situational awareness of ELE 23 maintenance crew working on the RWY, preventing them to take avoiding action.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ATI Report number: AET-2012/AC-01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  14 May 2023 LX-OCV Cargolux 0 Luxembourg-Findel Airport (LUX) sub Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The captain and one of the passengers were killed. The co-pilot and seven passengers survived. The aircraft was en route from BelÃ©m/Val-de-CÃ£es International Airport in Brazil to Senador JosÃ© PorfÃ­rio at an altitude of 2500 feet when the no.1 engine showed an increase in TIT (Turbine Inlet Temperature). The captain throttled back the engine, but the aircraft was not able to maintain altitude. The crew attempted to locate their destination airport but were unable. A forced landing was carried out 4 km from the airport. Contributing Factors: 1 Human Factor 1.1 Medical Aspect Not contributing. 1.2 Psychological Aspect 1.2.1 Individual Information A) Attitude - contributed There was disregard for the procedures, since the pilots did not use the checklist for the emergency situation. 1.2.2 Psychosocial Information A) Culture of the working group - undetermined It is possible that the informal rules, shared by some pilots, regarding the use of the checklist, have influenced the behavior of the pilot to decline its use. 1.2.3 Organizational Information A) Organizational culture - contributed The company evidenced to have an organizational culture based on the informality of the adopted procedures, from the planning to the maintenance of the aircraft, which compromised the safe accomplishment of the operation. B) Organizational processes - contributed The company did not have an effective supervision system, allowing the aircraft to be used under inadequate conditions. 1.3 Operational Aspect 1.3.1 Concerning the operation of the aircraft A) Adverse weather conditions - contributed The meteorological conditions at the time of the occurrence made it difficult for the crew to locate the aerodrome, causing the aircraft to move away from the approach path to the runway which, added to the drag produced by the unfeathered propeller, aggravated the flight situation, contributing to the forced landing. B) Coordination of cabin - contributed The fact that the crew had been searching for the aerodrome, now turning their attention to the passenger who went to the cabin of the aircraft, or turning the attention to the engine failure, caused inattention as to the use of the checklist, resulting in non-compliance and failure to perform prescribed procedures, such as not feathering the left propeller by the propeller lever. This made it difficult to maintain the flight, because the windmilling propeller caused drag, culminating in the forced landing. C) Pilot trial - contributed The fact that the commander of the aircraft did not follow the procedures foreseen in the checklist, as suggested by the co-pilot after the engine failure, was decisive for the maintenance of the windmilling propeller, causing a drag that made it difficult to maintain the flight, contributing to forced landing. D) Maintenance of the aircraft - contributed The fact that the aircraft operator did not comply with the ANAC guidance related to the left engine condition with the overdue TBO, as well as not having identified the maintenance services performed and defined as not recommended by the manufacturer, contributed that the left engine was operated with the inappropriate governor connection, which resulted in loss of power in flight. E) Management oversight - contributed Supervision of aircraft maintenance activities was not adequate, allowing the aircraft to operate with nonconformities and culminating in in-flight engine failure. 1.3.2 Concerning ATS organs Not contributing. 2 Material Factor 2.1 Concerning the aircraft Not contributing. 2.2 Concerning equipment and technology systems for ATS Not contributing.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CENIPA Report number: A-122/CENIPA/2012 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Piquiatuba TÃ¡xi AÃ©reo   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All 82 passengers and eight crew members were killed. The airplane operated on Ethiopian Airlines flight ET409 from Beirut International Airport (BEY) to Addis Ababa-Bole Airport (ADD). Instruments meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, and the flight was on an instrument flight plan. It was night in dark lighting conditions with reported isolated cumulonimbus clouds and thunderstorms in the area. Flight ET409 was initially cleared by ATC on a LATEB 1 D Standard Instrument Departure (SID) from runway 21. Just before takeoff, ATC changed the clearance to an ""immediate right turn direct Chekka"". The Boeing 737 took off from runway 21 at 02:36. After takeoff ATC instructed ET409 to turn right on a heading of 315Â° and change frequencies and contact Beirut Control. ET409 acknowledged the clearance and continued a right turn. ATC instructed ET409 to turn left heading 270Â°, which was acknowledged. The flight continued the climbing left turn to heading 270Â° but did not maintain that heading. The aircraft continued on a southerly track. Just prior to reaching altitude of 7700 feet, the stick shaker activated, sounding for a period of 29 seconds. Meanwhile the airplane reached an angle of attack (AOA) of 32Â° and began a descent to 6000 feet. When the stick shaker ceased, the aircraft began to climb again. At 02:40:56, just prior to reaching 9000 feet, the stick shaker activated again, sounding for a period of 26 seconds. After reaching 9000 feet the aircraft made a sharp left turn and descended rapidly. The maximum registered bank angle was 118Â° left and the airplane reached a maximum registered speed was 407.5 knots at a G load of 4.412. The airplane disappeared from the radar screen and crashed into the Mediterranean Sea at 02:41:30. PROBABLE CAUSES: 1- The flight crew's mismanagement of the aircraft's speed, altitude, headings and attitude through inconsistent flight control inputs resulting in a loss of control. 2- The flight crew failure to abide by CRM principles of mutual support and calling deviations hindered any timely intervention and correction. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1- The manipulation of the flight controls by the flight crew in an ineffective manner resulted in the aircraft undesired behavior and increased the level of stress of the pilots. 2- The aircraft being out of trim for most of the flight directly increased the workload on the pilot and made his control of the aircraft more demanding. 3- The prevailing weather conditions at night most probably resulted in spatial disorientation to the flight crew and lead to loss of situational awareness. 4- The relative inexperience of the Flight Crew on type combined with their unfamiliarity with the airport contributed, most likely, to increase the Flight Crew workload and stress. 5- The consecutive flying (188 hours in 51 days) on a new type with the absolute minimum rest could have likely resulted in a chronic fatigue affecting the captain's performance. 6- The heavy meal discussed by the crew prior to take-off has affected their quality of sleep prior to that flight. 7- The aircraft 11 bank angle aural warnings, 2 stalls and final spiral dive contributed in the increase of the crew workload and stress level. 8- Symptoms similar to those of a subtle incapacitation have been identified and could have resulted from and/or explain most of the causes mentioned above. However, there is no factual evidence to confirm without any doubt such a cause. 9- The F/O reluctance to intervene did not help in confirming a case of captain's subtle incapacitation and/or to take over control of the aircraft as stipulated in the operator's SOP.METAR: 00:00 UTC / 02:00 local time: OLBA 250000Z 31008KT 280V340 8000 VCTS FEW020CB SCT026 13/06 Q1014 NOSIG= wind 310 degrees at 8 knots, variable from 280Â° to 340Â°; visibility 8km; thunderstorms in the vicinity; few clouds with cumulonimbus at 2,000 ft; scattered clouds at 2,600 ft; temperature 13 degrees C, dew point 6 degrees C, pressure 1014 hPa01:00 UTC / 03:00 local time: OLBA 250100Z VRB03KT 4000 SHRA FEW020CB BKN026 12/07 Q1014 NOSIG=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MoPW&T Report number: - Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   BBC  AlArabiya  OLBA (Beirut) SID departure charts   Location  Images: photo (c) Lebanon CAA / BEA photo (c) Lebanon CAA / BEA photo (c) Neil Randell; Lasham Airport (QLA/EGHL); 11 July 2009 photo (c) Werner Fischdick; London-Stansted Airport (STN/EGSS); 12 July 2006 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

At around 18:53 local time, the crew began the descent for an ILS approach to runway 09 at Grenoble Airport, France. It was a dark night with the moon still below the horizon. The crew was established on the localizer at about 10 nm from the runway threshold and had the runway in sight. At 19:23, at a height of approximately 1500 ft, the undercarriage was deployed at an indicated airspeed (IAS) 157 kt.  At a height of about 1000 ft, the crew disengaged the autopilot. The aircraft was stabilized at a slightly higher speed than Vapp, on the glide path and with a vertical speed of -700 ft/min. At a height of approximately 200 ft, the pilot flying disconnected the auto-throttle. The approach remained stabilized on the 3Â° glide path at a speed equal to Vapp + 3 kt and a descent rate of 700 ft/min until a height of 100 ft. Passing 100 ft, the IAS started to decrease and went below Vapp. The rate of descent increased to 850 ft/min. The pitch was 4Â° and the nose started to lift slightly. At a height of 30 ft, the plane passed slightly below the glide slope at an IAS of Vapp -4 kt. At a height of 15 ft, the elevator was operated abruptly causing a rapid increase in pitch attitude. Two seconds later, the rear fuselage touched down, with a pitch of 10.7Â°. The traces left on the runway indicate a contact point 166 meters before the touchdown zone. The vertical acceleration value reached a maximum of 1.95 g. Two seconds later, the throttles were brought back and the thrust reversers were deployed. The aircraft then rolled to the apron. CAUSE (translated from French): The accident was caused by continuing the landing when the situational awareness of the crew had deteriorated. This led to an inaccurate estimate of the height from the end point of the trajectory and no flare. The following factors contributed to the accident: - The crew did not select the maximum illumination of the landing lights; - Runway 09 at the Grenoble-IsÃ¨re airport is not equipped with visual indicator approach slope; - Management of the manual throttles to land was inadequate.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Report number: oy-p100206 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All six crew members and 46 passengers survived the accident. The domestic passenger flight TGN162 departed Tanjung Redep/Berau-Kalimaru Airport (BEJ) at 10:30 and climbed to Flight Level (FL) 140. Balikpapan approach cleared the crew direct to Samarinda Airport (SRI). The enroute part of the flight was uneventful. On approach to Samarinda, the crew was cleared to track direct to left downwind for runway 04. The controller informed them that the wind was 060 degrees at 12 knots. During the final approach for runway 04, the left ECU (Engine Control Unit) light illuminated followed by low oil pressure and torque indications. The captain decided to go around and divert to Balikpapan-Sepingan Airport (BPN) which was 92 km (50 NM) to the South. The flight crew carried out the engine shut-down procedure and commenced a climb to 4000 ft with the left engine inoperative. Approximately 16 Nm from Balikpapan Airport, while climbing through 3,800 feet, the right ECU light illuminated, immediately followed by low oil pressure and low torque indications. The right engine then failed. The crew broadcast a MAYDAY to Balikpapan Approach and decided to conduct a forced landing into a clear field in the Samboja area, about 16 Nm from the Balikpapan Airport. CAUSES: ""The both engine were lack of fuel before flame out, it was indicated the fuel management was out of control during flight that might be a misleading of fuel quantity indication. The proper analysis could not be carried out due to both FDR and CVR were un-operated.""

The extreme turbulence encounter caused a brief loss of control that lasted less than a minute. The airplane then made an uneventful descent and landing. A postflight inspection of the airplane revealed overstress damage that caused wrinkling and debonding on both wings. The synoptic surface weather chart for the flight identified an area of high pressure to the west and an area of low pressure to the east. These conditions were conducive to mountain wave turbulence. An inflight weather advisory was in effect for moderate turbulence, icing, and mountain obscuration for the accident location and altitude. Low-level significant weather charts advised of moderate or greater turbulence below 20,000 feet for the accident region. Pilot reports in the area near the time of the turbulence event indicated moderate levels of turbulence above 10,000 feet. The preflight weather information obtained by the flight crew did not include available information about the turbulence forecasts or the pilot reports of turbulence.

When advised by the controller to check the airplane's heading, the flight crew noted the heading discrepancy and immediately initiated a turn back to the assigned heading. During the turn, the flight crew received a traffic alert and collision avoidance system resolution advisory (RA). The captain responded to the RA by initiating an estimated 1,500- to 2,000-foot-per-minute rate of descent followed by an approximate 2,000-foot-per-minute climb. During the RA response maneuvers, three flight attendants were standing in the aft galley, one of whom was seriously injured. Probable Cause: The pilot's abrupt airplane pitch change maneuver. Contributing to the accident was the flight crew's failure to maintain the heading specified by the air traffic controller, which would have avoided the near collision course with an unidentified airplane that triggered the traffic alert and collision avoidance system resolution advisory.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: WPR10LA134 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years Download report:  Final report Sources: NTSB WPR10LA134  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates02-Jun-2023 19:17 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

Both pilots were killed. Flight TIE039C departed Prague-Ruzyne International Airport (PRG) at 20:08 on an IFR flight to Karlstad Airport (KSD), Sweden. The copilot was Pilot Flying. At 20:14, while the airplane was climbing to cruising altitude, the copilot asked the captain if she had ever flown a roll at night. Meanwhile, the air traffic controller at Prague cleared the flight to climb to FL260.  The flightcrew continued their conversation about performing a roll with Citation Bravo jets. At 20:17 the Pilot Flying rolled the 30Â° to the left and immediately 20Â° to the right. Prague ATC then instructed the flight to contact Munich ATC. Contact was established and clearance was given to climb from FL260 to FL330. This was confirmed by the crew. At 20:18 the captain asked the copilot if their altitude was high enough to perform a roll. The copilot confirmed that the altitude was sufficient. At 20:19 the flight levelled off at FL270. Five seconds later the nose pitched up to 14Â° and a roll to the right was initiated. Within four seconds the airplane was flying upside down. It rolled a further 90Â° in the next four seconds. Meanwhile the heading began to change and the nose dropped in an almost vertical dive of -85Â°. The computed airspeed increased from about 240 knots at the initiation of the roll to 380 knots during the descent. The flight crew were not able to recover and the airplane impacted a forest. CAUSES (translated from German): The accident is due to the fact that: - The crew attempted to perform maneuvers (roll) that are not planned for in commercial aviation. - The crew lost spatial orientation and subsequently the skill for a controlled recovery from the attained attitude. The following factors have contributed: - The pilots were not trained in aerobatics. - Night-time conditions existed, thereby lacking visual references. - The personal relationship between two pilots led to a lack of professional behavior while working together in the cockpit. - The aircraft was not designed or approved for aerobatics.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BFU Report number: BFU CX001-10 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) VÃ¡clav Kudela; Praha-Ruzyne International Airport (PRG/LKPR); 31 July 2005 photo (c) VÃ¡clav Kudela; Praha-Ruzyne International Airport (PRG/LKPR); 01 August 2005 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

During the flight the weather conditions, which initially were favorable, deteriorated. Upon arrival at the destination, the airport started to operate under VFR Special conditions. The pilot was cleared for an approach to runway 30. The landing took place in heavy rain and during the landing roll out, when applying the brakes, the pilot realized that it did not have effectiveness in the braking of the aircraft. He then used the emergency brake. The aircraft left the runway on the right side and stopped after the left main landing gear broke.

The airline transport pilot and his seven passengers were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, which was originating at the time of the accident. The intended destination was Kipnuk, Alaska, and a company flight plan had been filed. The pilot said that the takeoff was normal, but at 200 feet above the ground and in a turn, he observed a reduction in power. He moved the emergency fuel control lever forward, and power was restored. Before the sink rate could be reversed, the airplane impacted the surface of a frozen lake, and the end of the right wing was bent up. The aileron was not damaged. For safety reasons, the pilot chose to fly straight ahead for 8 miles to Kongiganak, Alaska, where the flight landed without further difficulty. The right wing required a major repair to restore it to airworthy condition. A postaccident inspection disclosed no mechanical anomalies with the engine or its accessories, and the airplane was flown to its base after the wing was repaired without any engine problems noted. A weather study by a Safety Board meteorologist determined that the area was subject to light snow showers, freezing fog and mist, and surface temperatures below freezing, all conducive to wing/airframe icing. During an interview with Federal Aviation Administration inspectors, the pilot acknowledged seeing ""a trace of ice"" on the wings.

Of the 243 passengers and 19 crew members on board, 17 passengers and eight flight attendants (FA) received minor injuries and one FA received a serious injury.  The airplane received minor damaged.  The flight was operating under 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 121 as a regularly scheduled international passenger flight from Dulles International Airport (IAD), Washington, DC, to Narita International Airport (NRT), Narita, Japan. Prior to the turbulence encounter, the flight crew received pilot reports (PIREPs) of moderate to severe turbulence above FL340 and that it was less at FL300.  According to the flight crew, about one hour late, the flight began to encounter a few ""light bumps"" or intermittent light ""chop."" The sky conditions were clear with good visibility. The captain turned on the ""fasten seat belt"" sign and made a public address (PA) announcement to fasten seat belts. The flight crew requested a descent to FL300 and began to encounter moderate turbulence after starting the descent.  The first officer then made a PA announcement directing the flight attendants to ""take your seats."" The autopilot remained engaged throughout the turbulence encounter, which lasted less than one minute.   After encountering the turbulence, the crew assessed airplane damage and checked the number and severity of injuries to passengers and crew.  The crew was assisted in assessing passenger and crew injuries by a U.S. Army Special Forces medic who stated that all of the injuries were considered minor. All the FAs indicated that they were able to perform their required emergency duties for the remainder of the flight. After discussing the injuries and the available diversion airports with the FAs, company dispatch and the medic, the flight crew decided to continue on to NRT since there were sufficient diversion airports along the route if the situation worsened. Upon arrival in NRT, 16 passengers and one FA were transported to hospitals for medical evaluation.  All were released with only minor injuries, however, the FA was re-evaluated by her personal physician when she returned home with the further diagnosis of a fractured rib.

The aircraft had departed from Dar es Salaam. The en route part of the flight was uneventful. At 07:22 hours the flight contacted the Mwanza Tower controller and requested information about the location of the CB cloud which had earlier been mentioned by another aircraft in the area. Mwanza Tower informed the flight that there was a CB lying north east of the airport. The relevant METAR weather information was also transmitted to the flight. The pilot subsequently requested to use runway 30 and was cleared to do so. By that time the wind was 030Âº/18 kt and the visibility was 10 km. The aircraft proceeded to make a visual approach to the airfield and later reported field in sight. The captain was flying the aircraft. He testified that the approach to runway 30 and touchdown were all normal. He also claimed that after reverse thrust was selected, the aircraft entered a puddle of water that adversely affected its performance and controllability and caused it to veer off the runway. After covering 305 metres on grass, the aircraft came to rest on grass off the left edge of runway 30 some 1450 metres from the threshold. About 5 metres of the right wing was protruding into the runway and the nose section was resting on the tarmac surface of a service road.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIB Tanzania Report number: CAV/ACC/4/10 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: ippmedia.com, 14-3-2010   Location  Images: photo (c) anon.; Mwanza Airport (MWZ/HTMW); 01 March 2010 photo (c) Hansueli Krapf; Mwanza Airport (MWZ/HTMW); 14 September 2010; (sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The unlit light was the left main gear lock indication. Five seconds later, the green hydraulic system pressure and level read zero. The crew declared an emergency and made their approach at minimum speed. During braking, the left main gear collapsed backwards. The aircraft went off the left side of the runway and came to rest on a strip of land 2000 meters past the runway threshold. The five crew members evacuated the aircraft without any problems. Causes of the accident: Fatigue cracking led to the failure of the left main gear hinge arm. This cracking was most probably initiated by a corrosion pit, which appeared and/or was not detected during the last general overhaul. The origin of this corrosion pitting could not be clearly identified. However, the investigation revealed certain deficiencies in the maintenance tasks carried out during the general overhaul of the gear. The implementation of incomplete and inadequate work cards and tracking sheets in the workshop may have contributed to the accident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Report number: tc-b100301 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 years and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Pprune  OIAX Notam   Location  Images: photo (c) U.S. Air Force photo by/Tech.

The airplane continued to its intended destination of Taipei-Taoyuan International Airport (TPE/RCTP), Taiwan. There were no injuries to the crew, and the airplane received substantial damage. When entering the required data into Runway Analysis System, the pilot took the Max Landing Weight as Max Take-Off Weight obtained from Computerized Flight Plan; which led the calculation to provide erroneous take-off thrust, take-off reference speed and take-off model. The aircraft did not obtain enough lift required for take-off, the angles of ground and attack were too large; which caused that the tail had ground contact. During the take-off roll, the pilot had stick shaker warning, then released stick and set the manual thrust to MAX to continue the take-off. In the air the pilot inspected the instruments of cabin pressure and engines which were normal. After landing at 16:48, maintenance personnel checked and found the rear section of aircraft belly had substantial damage Findings Related to Probable Causes: 1. When entering the required data into Runway Analysis System, CM 1 used the data from Computerized Flight Plan but took the max landing weight mistakenly as max take-off weight. Then CM 2 did not cross check to confirm the accuracy of the input data, and did not review all the data after retrieving take off performance figures from Runway Analysis System; so it was not discovered that the max take-off weight that was entered by mistake caused the mal-calculation of take-off thrust, -reference speed and -model. 2. CM 2 entered the erroneous take-off thrust provided by Runway Analysis System into Flight Management System which failed to calculate take-off reference speed; so the columns of V1, VR ,V2 on the page of the take-off speed showed Â- - - Â and the pilot did not understand the meaning of Â- - - Â, at the end he decided to use the take-off reference speed calculated by Runway Analysis System to enter into Flight Management System. 3. CM 3 has checked Runway Analysis Manual during taxiing to verify the accuracy of the calculation done by Runway Analysis System. However the source of Âmax take-off weightÂ was from the system and not from Weight and Balance Sheet nor Computerized Flight Plan. Therefore it was discovered that the take-off reference speed calculated by Runway Analysis System was much lower than the actual figure that the aircraft should have used. 4. When taking off the aircraft speed reached the VR value calculated by Runway Analysis System, 2 seconds later the aircraft started to roll. Because the actual roll speed of 149 knots/hour was lower than the correct value of 166 knots/hour, the aircraft did not have enough lift required for take-off and angles of ground and attack way too large; which caused the aircraft tail to touch ground.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ASC Report number: ASC-AOR-11-05-001 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft was tracking on a GURAK 3 standard instrument departure, which involved transiting through Pearce military controlled airspace. While maintaining flight level (FL) 120 and turning left onto a heading of 330 degrees under the control of Pearce air traffic control (ATC), the crew received a traffic advisory (TA) warning from the traffic alert and collision avoidance system (TCAS). The crew advised ATC and were instructed to continue the turn onto a heading of 360 degrees. During the turn, the crew received a resolution advisory (RA). The crew responded and climbed the aircraft to FL125. The crew were advised by ATC that the conflicting aircraft, a military-operated Raytheon Aircraft Company 350 (King Air) descending through FL120 on a reciprocal track, had the 717 in sight and was maintaining separation. By this time, the radar separation standard had reduced below the required distance of 3 NM (5.6 km). This occurrence reinforces the importance of effective coordination between ATC positions, and highlights the challenges faced by air traffic controllers when managing aircraft operating within the same airspace, but under the control of different ATC positions.Sources: ATSB AO-2010-014  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates24-Jul-2023 12:13 harro Updated Corrections or additions? ...

The flight departed Palm Beach, Florida on March 7 and made refueling stops at Aguadilla, Puerto Rico and Manaus, Brazil. During takeoff from runway 10 at Manaus-Eduardo Gomes International Airport, the crew heard a loud external noise followed by a yaw to the right and then new noise, similar to a tire burst. Speed at the time of the occurrence was just below V1. The crew decided to abort the takeoff by reducing the thrust levers and engaging the spoilers. The aircraft did not have reversers and was partially controlled on the center of the runway with use of pedals and differential brakes. However, the aircraft could not be stopped on the runway and overran by about 400 m. Contributing factors (translated from Portuguese): a) Cockpit coordination - undetermined The diversity of configurations of the company's aircraft was a complicating factor in aircraft operation, and may have contributed to inadequate cockpit coordination at the time of takeoff abortion. b) Pilot unawareness - undetermined As the drag chute was optional equipment, it is possible that the crew has forgotten that the aircraft was equipped with this device. c) Pilot experience - contributed The pilot did not use the parachute by judging their use at low speed would be inefficient, and, as was optional equipment, there was no description of its use in the aircraft manual. d) Maintenance of aircraft - undetermined Tests conducted on wheels identified that the six connecting bolts of the right outer wheel torque with semicubos were approximately 90% lower than foreseen. It is possible that this fact has contributed to the tire deflation.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CENIPA Report number: IG-171/CENIPA/2013 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

One of the six occupants was injured. The flight took off from Helsinki-Vantaa Airport, Finland at 09:46 local time. The flight was uneventful until 10:14 hours, 9.5 nm from Tallinn runway 26. When the power levers were retarded to flight idle the crew noticed engine vibration and smelled a smoke in the cockpit. The engine chip detector indicator in the cockpit was lit. After a short discussion about which engine should be shut down the flight engineer shut down the left engine and the captain tried to start the APU to gain more thrust. During the approach the air traffic controller noticed the aircraft deviating from the approach path to the left and notified the crew. The crew was unable to maintain a proper approach path both in lateral and vertical dimensions. The attempts to start the APU engine failed. Visual contact with the runway was established 0.5 nm from the threshold. The aircraft crossed the airport boundary being not configured for landing and with an indicated airspeed (IAS) of 295-300 km/h. The flaps were extended for 10Â° over the threshold; the landing gear was lowered after passing the runway threshold and retracted again. The aircraft made a high speed low pass over the runway at an altitude of ca 10-15 feet with the landing gear traveling down and up again. Flaps were extended over the runway. At the end of the runway full power on the right engine was selected, and the aircraft climbed 15-20 feet and started turning left. The crew started retracting flaps and lowered the landing gear. The aircraft crossed the highway at the end of the runway at ca 30 feet, then descended again, colliding with treetops at the lake shore and made a crash-landing on the snow and ice-covered lake waterline. Due to the thick ice the aircraft remained on the ice and slid 151 m on the ice with heading 238Â° before coming to a full stop. After the impact the flight engineer shoot down the right engine and power and released all engine fire extinguishers. All persons onboard escaped immediately through the main door. No emergency was declared and despite suggestions from first officer, a go-around was not formally commanded. The airplane gradually sank through the ice after the accident. Causes of the accident: 1. The failure of the left engine lubrication oil system, leading to the failure of the rear compressor bearing and inflight engine failure. 2. The failure of the crew to maintain the approach path and adhere to single engine landing procedures. Factors contributing to the accident: 1. Improper and insufficient crew training, inter alia complete absence of simulator training 2. The lack of effective coordination between crewmembers 3. The failure of the crew to start RU19A-300 (APU) 4. Adverse weather conditions 5. Inadequate company supervision by Polish CAA, consisting in not noticing the lack of flight crew training and companies generally poor safety culture. 6.

Weather was reported to the crew as: visibility at the beginning of runway 1300, mid-600, at the end of 550 m, vertical visibility 60 m, wind 170 degrees, at 2 m/sec. The airplane descended until it struck trees, cutting a swath trough the forest. It came to rest 1450 m short of the runway threshold and 150 m further to the right of the runway. Conclusion: Investigators concluded that the flight crew conducted an approach to the airport in below-minima weather conditions for an airplane with a defective flight control computer system. They failed to execute a go-around when failing to obtain visual contact with the ground. Contributing factors were: - Insufficient training of the crew to perform approaches at or near weather minima; - Lack of control over the activities of the crew, which led to poor resource management (CRM) of the captain; - Failure of the flight control computer system, which led to an increase in the allowed weather minima of the aircraft; - Failure of captain to divert to another airport; - Failure of captain to decide about a missed approach when there was visual contact with the approach lights; - Failure of the co-pilot to call for a missed approach; - Unsatisfactory interaction in the crew, resulting in a descent below safe altitude. Failure of the flight control computer system in flight (most likely due to unstable radio altimeters at altitudes exceeding their operating range) and the impossibility of ""removal"" of failure on this plane because of the lack of buttons to simulate the compression of the undercarriage, and inadequate crew training, and possibly fatigue, led to a significant increase of mental and emotional stress in which it it is not possible to make the best decision for the successful completion of the flight.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: MAK Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC)  Federal Agency for Air Transport   Location  Images: photo (c) MAK Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC); near Moskva-Domodedovo Airport (DME/UUDD); 22 March 2010 photo (c) MAK Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC); near Moskva-Domodedovo Airport (DME/UUDD); March 2010 photo (c) MAK Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC); near Moskva-Domodedovo Airport (DME/UUDD); March 2010 photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Moskva-Vnukovo Airport (VKO/UUWW); April 2000 photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Maastricht/Aachen Airport (MST/EHBK); July 1994 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Both pilots were killed.  The EMB-120 prepared to take off from the taxiway E2 intersection of runway 29. The flight was a training flight to revalidate the captain's command instrument rating. The supervisory pilot/training captain advised the aerodrome controller that the departure would incorporate asymmetric flight (a simulated engine failure), and was approved by the controller to perform the manoeuvre. Witnesses reported that the takeoff appeared 'normal' until a few moments after becoming airborne, when the aircraft rolled and diverged left from its takeoff path. They watched as the aircraft continued rolling left, and entered a steep nose-down attitude. The airplane impacted the ground in a right wing-low, nose-down attitude of about 65 degrees. A high intensity, fuel-fed fire that followed the collision with the ground destroyed most of the fuselage and cabin and right wing. CONTRIBUTING SAFETY FACTORS: - The pilot in command initiated a simulated left engine failure just after becoming airborne and at a speed that did not allow adequate margin for error. - The pilot in command simulated a failure of the left engine by selecting flight idle instead of zero thrust, thereby simulating a simultaneous failure of the left engine and its propeller autofeather system, instead of a failure of the engine alone. - The pilot under check operated the aircraft at a speed and attitude (bank angle) that when uncorrected, resulted in a loss of control. - The pilot under check increased his workload by increasing torque on the right engine and selecting the yaw damper. - The pilot in command probably became preoccupied and did not abandon the simulated engine failure after the heading and speed tolerance for the manoeuvre were exceeded and before control of the aircraft was lost.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ATSB Report number: AO-2010-019 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Two pilots killed in Darwin plane crash (Nationwide News, 22-3-2010)  ATSB Report 	AO-2010-019   Location  Images: photo (c) ATSB; Darwin Airport, NT (DRW/YPDN); 22 March 2010 photo (c) ATSB; Darwin Airport, NT (DRW/YPDN); 22 March 2010 photo (c) ATSB; Darwin Airport, NT (DRW/YPDN); 22 March 2010 photo (c) ATSB; Darwin Airport, NT (DRW/YPDN); 22 March 2010 photo (c) ATSB; Darwin Airport, NT (DRW/YPDN); 22 March 2010 photo (c) ATSB; Darwin Airport, NT (DRW/YPDN); 22 March 2010 photo (c) Ramon Vila; Darwin Airport, NT (DRW/YPDN); 01 April 2005 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The owner of Eurofox N829BM, with no intent to fly, placed a wooden chock under one of the main landing gear wheels and removed the upper engine cowl. He attempted to trouble shoot an engine starting problem on the Eurofox aircraft. The Eurofox engine started when his right knee contacted the starter switch as he attempted to enter the unoccupied aircraft. The Eurofox's engine continued to run causing the aircraft to jump the wooden chock and surge forward. The unoccupied aircraft traveled approximately 200 feet until it struck a Learjet 35A, registration N376HA. The Eurofox's right wing forward leading edge and wing tip struck the Learjet empennage tail section. The impact caused both the Learjet and the Eurofox to pivot in clockwise directions. The eurofox rotated to a position which permitted its composite propeller to disintegrate as it contacted the Learjet's left outboard wing, aileron, and fuel tank. The Eurofox's engine ceased operating shortly after contact with the other aircraft.  The Eurofox suffered substantial damage to its entire wing structure, wing struts, propeller, forward fuselage, firewall, and engine compartment.  The Learjet suffered substantial damage to the empennage tail section, wing structure, and fuselage. There was visible damage to the wing at the wing root and to the fuselage at areas above, below, forward, and aft of the wing root.

An Instrument Landing System approach was carried out and the aircraft touched down on the 6150 foot long runway 06. Following touchdown, the flight crew were unable to stop the aircraft prior to the end of the runway. The aircraft came to rest in deep mud, the nose wheel approximately 340 feet beyond the runway end and 140 feet beyond the edge of the paved runway end strip. A local fire department responded and arrived on-scene approximately 20 minutes after the aircraft departed the runway. The flight crew exited the aircraft using a ladder provided by the fire fighters. There were no injuries and the aircraft had minor damage. FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1. The aircraft touched down between 2000 and 2500 feet from the threshold and at a higher than required airspeed, which significantly increased the required runway length to safely stop the aircraft. 2. The presence of standing water on the runway caused the aircraft to hydroplane, which led to a loss of directional control and braking ability, significantly increasing the required stopping distance. 3. The reduction of reverse thrust following touchdown to realign with the runway centreline, in accordance with the manufacturer's recommended practice, increased the aircraft's required stopping distance. 4. The decision to carry out a pilot-flown-approach, rather than a pilot-monitored-approach, at night, in heavy rain, likely contributed to the aircraft's higher than required airspeed that was maintained until touchdown. 5. The combination of delayed touchdown point, higher than required touchdown speed, and standing water on the runway prevented the aircraft from stopping within the available landing distance. As a result, the aircraft overran the runway, coming to rest in deep mud.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: TSB Report A10A0032 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ  History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  17 April 2018 C-GCJZ Cargojet Airways 0 near Hamilton, ON (CYHM) min Engine failure Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All on board were killed in the accident, including Polish President Lech Kaczynski. The airplane departed Warszawa-Okecie Airport (WAW), Poland at 07:27 local time, carrying Polish President Lech Kaczynski, his wife, several Members of Parliament, President of the National Bank of Poland Slawomir Skrzypek, Chief of General Staff Franciszek Gagor, the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrzej Kremer and a number of passengers and crew members.  During the flight the crew was in contact with air traffic controllers at Minsk, Moscow and Smolensk. The crew also was in contact with the crew of a Polish Air Force Yakovlev 40 passenger plane that had landed at Smolensk Air Base 90 minutes ahead of the Presidential flight. At about 10:14 the flight descended through an altitude of 7500 m. Minsk Control radioed that the visibility at Smolensk Air Base was 400 m due to fog. The same conditions were transmitted to the crew when they contacted the controller at Smolensk. About 10:25 the pilot of the Yak-40 on the ground at Smolensk radioed that horizontal visibility was 400 m and vertical visibility about 50 m. Shortly afterwards they reported that an Ilyushin 76 transport plane had diverted to an alternate airfield after two attempts to land. The crew continued preparations for an approach to runway 26 at the Smolensk Air Base. The cockpit door was open and during the approach there were two passengers present on the flight deck. Meanwhile, visibility worsened to 200 m. This information was transmitted to the crew at 10:37. The crew requested permission to carry out a 'trial' approach to decision height (100 m) and asked the controller to expect a go around. About 18 seconds before impact the terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS) sounded: ""Pull up"", followed by an aural warning: ""TERRAIN AHEAD"". About 5 seconds before impact the autopilot and autothrottle were disconnected in order to execute a go around. The airplane contacted upsloping terrain at a distance of about 1100 meters from the runway and 40 m to the left of extended centreline. The aircraft height at that point was 15 m below the level of the runway threshold. The left wing struck a large tree causing the airplane to roll inverted. The Tu-154 crashed and broke up. The immediate cause of the accident was the failure of the crew to take a timely decision to proceed to an alternate airdrome although they were not once timely informed on the actual weather conditions at Smolensk ""Severny"" Airdrome that were significantly lower than the established airdrome minima; descent without visual contact with ground references to an altitude much lower than minimum descent altitude for go around (100 m) in order to establish visual flight as well as no reaction to the numerous TAWS warnings which led to controlled flight into terrain, aircraft destruction and death of the crew and passengers. According to the conclusion made by the pilot-experts and aviation psychologists, the presence of the Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Air Forces in the cockpit until the collision exposed psychological pressure on the PIC's decision to continue descent in the conditions of unjustified risk with a dominating aim of landing at any means. Contributing factors to the accident were: - long discussion of the Tu-154M crew with the Protocol Director and crew of the Polish Yak-40 concerning the information on the actual weather that was lower than the established minima and impossibility (according to the Tu-154M crew opinion) to land at the destination airdrome which increased the psychological stress of the crew and made the PIC experience psychological clash of motives: on the one hand he realized that landing in such conditions was unsafe, on the other hand he faced strong motivation to land exactly at the destination airdrome. In case of proceeding to an alternate airdrome the PIC expected negative reaction from the Main Passenger; - lack of compliance to the SOP and lack of CRM in the crew; - a significant break in flights in complicated weather conditions (corresponding to his weather minima 60x800) that the PIC had had as well as his low experience in conducting non-precision approach; - early transition by the navigator to the altitude callouts on the basis of the radio altimeter indications without considering the uneven terrain; - conducting flight with engaged autopilot and autothrottle down to altitudes much lower than the minimum descent altitude which does not comply with the FCOM provisions; - late start of final descent which resulted in increased vertical speed of descent the crew had to maintain. The systematic causes of the accident involving the Tu-154M tail number 101 aircraft of the Republic of Poland were significant shortcomings in the organization of flight operations, flight crew preparation and arrangement of the VIP flight in the special air regiment. In a separate investigation , the Polish Committee for Investigation of National Aviation Accidents concluded the following: Cause of Accident: The immediate cause of the accident was the descent below the minimum descent altitude at an excessive rate of descent in weather conditions which prevented visual contact with the ground, as well as a delayed execution of the go-around procedure. Those circumstances led to an impact on a terrain obstacle resulting in separation of a part of the left wing with aileron and consequently to the loss of aircraft control and eventual ground impact.  Circumstances Contributing to the Accident: 1) Failure to monitor altitude by means of a pressure altimeter during a non-precision approach;  2) failure by the crew to respond to the PULL UP warning generated by the TAWS;  3) attempt to execute the go-around maneuver under the control of ABSU (automatic go around);  4) Approach Control confirming to the crew the correct position of the airplane in relation to the RWY threshold, glide slope, and course which might have affirmed the crew's belief that the approach was proceeding correctly although the airplane was actually outside the permissible deviation margin;  5) failure by LZC to inform the crew about descending below the glide slope and delayed issuance of the level-out command;  6) incorrect training of the Tu-154M flight crews in the 36 Regiment.

The strip surface was smooth snow. There were two crew and two passengers on board, as well as a small skidoo, a skidoo sled, and boxed gear. The sky conditions were clear and the winds were estimated to be 5 to 8 knots. The takeoff was initiated on a slight downhill slope, into approximately 70 degrees of crosswind, with a minimum of 2000 feet available to a predetermined reject point. All engine parameters were normal; however, the aircraft did not accelerate as expected and the takeoff continued approximately 800 feet past the reject point, to an area where the terrain sloped more steeply into a depression. The aircraft became airborne at low speed over the depression and maximum power was applied in order to clear gently rising terrain ahead. The main gear contacted the ground on the far side of the depression, and the aircraft bounced and touched down a second time in an area covered by basketball size rocks. At that point the takeoff was rejected and the aircraft came to a stop approximately 300 feet past the second touchdown point. There were no injuries; however the nose gear broke off at the fork, and the aircraft sustained substantial damage to the forward, lower and aft fuselage.Sources: CADORS 2010C1086 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  23 January 2013 C-GKBC Kenn Borek Air 3 Mount Elizabeth w/o CFIT Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The crew had carried out the sector from Hong Kong to Surabaya on the previous day. The accident aircraft stayed overnight at Surabaya Airport and was parked at Stand 8. The accident aircraft uplifted 24,400 kilogram (kg) of fuel and was prepared for departure. The flight was airborne at 08:24 local time. During the climb, the flight crew noticed some abnormal Engine Pressure Ratio (EPR) fluctuations on No. 2 engine, with a range of approximately Â± 0.015 around EPR target. No. 1 engine also had abnormal EPR fluctuations but within a narrower range. At 08:58, shortly after levelling off at FL390, an ECAM message ""ENG 2 CTL SYS FAULT"" was annunciated. ECAM information ""ENG 2 SLOW RESPONSE"" was shown for crew awareness. After consulting with a maintenance engineer, it was decided to continue since all engine parameters were considered normal other than the EPR fluctuations. Almost two hours into the flight, the same ECAM message appeared, with an additional information message ""AVOID RAPID THR CHANGES"". The engine anti-ice was selected on for both engines, but this had not effect. The crew then again contacted a maintenance engineer, who told them that he had seen these EPR fluctuations before and that the Fuel Metering Unit (FMU) of engine no. 2 would be replaced after landing. Nearing the destination, the crew began to prepare for a runway 07L arrival. According to recent weather information, significant windshear was forecast for both runway 07L and 07R. At 13:19 hrs local time during the descent to a cleared level of FL230, ECAM messages ""ENG 1 CTL SYS FAULT"" and ""ENG 2 STALL"" were annunciated within a short period of time. According to the Commander, a light ""pop"" sound was heard and some ""ozone"" and ""burning"" smell was detected shortly before the ECAM message ""ENG 2 STALL"". At that time the flight was at about 110 nautical miles southeast of Hong Kong, and was descending through FL300 with a Calibrated Air Speed (CAS) of 295 kt. Vertical mode ""Open Descent"" was selected. The flight crew completed the necessary ECAM actions and set No. 2 thrust lever accordingly to IDLE position. ECAM information ""ENG 1 SLOW RESPONSE"" and ""AVOID RAPID THRUST CHANGES"" were also annunciated. No. 1 thrust lever was advanced to Maximum Continuous Thrust (MCT) position as per the ""SINGLE ENGINE OPERATIONS"" strategy stated in the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH). However No. 1 engine N1 only temporary increased to about 57% N1 and then dropped back to about 37% N1 at 13:21 hrs. At 13:21 hrs, the flight crew declared ""PAN PAN"" to Hong Kong Radar and advised that No. 2 engine was operating at idle thrust. The crew made the request to shorten the track for a priority landing. Hong Kong Radar then cleared the flight to proceed directly to waypoint ""LIMES"".  At about 13:26 hrs, the Commander took control of the aircraft as the PF in accordance with Cathay standard operating procedures for one engine inoperative and the co-pilot became the Pilot Monitoring. At 13:30 hrs, when the aircraft was approximately 45 nm southeast from Hong Kong and was about to level off at 8,000 ft AMSL, ECAM message ""ENG 1 STALL"" was annunciated. The CAS at that moment was about 295 kt. ECAM actions were carried out by the flight crew and No. 1 thrust lever was put to IDLE position accordingly. Autothrust (A/THR) was disengaged and both engine master switches remained at the ""ON"" position. With both thrust levers at IDLE position, the Commander then tested the controllability of the engines by moving the thrust levers one at a time. There were no thrust changes corresponding to the engine lever movements initially. At 13:32 hrs, ECAM messages ""ENG 1 STALL"" was annunciated again. At 13:32 hrs, the crew declared ""MAYDAY"" and advised Hong Kong Approach of the double engine stall situation. CPA780 was then cleared to descend to 3,000 ft AMSL. At that time, the aircraft was still in Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) and the CAS was at about 233 kt and reducing. At around the same time, the Commander disconnected the Autopilot and the Flight Directors (FD) and flew the aircraft manually. The altitude increased from 6,760 ft to 7,164 ft AMSL with the CAS reducing and the aircraft started to descend again when the CAS decreased to about 200 kt.  When the aircraft was on base leg during the approach, the flight crew reported that they were flying in VMC. The crew moved the thrust levers to check the engine control but there was no direct response from the engines. The No. 1 engine speed eventually increased to about 74% N1 with the No. 1 thrust lever in the CLB (climb) detent position. The No. 2 engine speed remained at sub-idle about 17% N1, with the No. 2 thrust lever at the IDLE position.  At 13:37 hrs, the ATC made both runways 07L and 07R available for CPA780. During the descent and approach, there were a number of other ECAM warning messages announced in the cockpit which were not relevant to the engine control problem.  The flight crew carried out the ""ENG ALL ENG FLAMEOUT - FUEL REMAINING"" checklist in the QRH for No. 2 engine in an attempt to clear the thrust control fault of that engine. As per the checklist, the Ram Air Turbine (RAT) was deployed manually, APU bleed was selected ""ON"" and No. 2 engine MASTER switch was set to ""OFF"" then ""ON"" at 13:38 hrs. However, No. 2 engine remained at a sub-idle speed of 17% N1. At 13:38 hrs, Flap CONF 1 was selected. At 13:39 hrs, when CPA780 was at 5,524 ft AMSL, a CAS at 219 kt and a distance of nine nm from the airport, the Commander tried to decrease the speed by retarding the No. 1 thrust lever. However, there was no corresponding decrease in No. 1 engine speed. Eventually, No. 1 thrust lever was left at the IDLE position and No. 1 engine speed remained at 74% N1. At 13:40 hrs, Hong Kong Approach cleared CPA780 for a visual approach for Runway 07L. Flight crew deployed the speedbrakes when the aircraft was at 5,216 ft AMSL descending with a CAS of 234 kt at around 8 nm from the runway. Flight crew selected landing gear down shortly afterwards. The Commander aimed to fly the aircraft at a CAS as close as possible to the Minimum Selectable Speed (VLS), which was 158 kt at that time. The aircraft went through the runway extended centreline and recaptured the centreline from the north in order to manage altitude and airspeed.  At around 13:41 hrs, with the Maximum Allowable Speed (Vmax) at 240 kt and actual CAS at 244 kt, an overspeed warning was generated by the onboard system. A short while later Hong Kong Approach cleared CPA780 to land on runway 07L and advised that the current surface wind was 150 degrees at 13 kt. Flight crew stowed the speedbrakes when the aircraft was at 984 ft AMSL and armed the ground spoilers at 816 ft AMSL. At 13:42 hrs, when CPA780 was still at flap CONF 1, with a CAS of 227 kt and a vertical speed of 1,216 ft per min at an altitude of 732 ft AMSL and at about two nm to touchdown, the warning ""Too Low Terrain"" was generated by the Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS). Flap CONF 2 was selected at around one nm to touchdown with a CAS of 234 kt and at an altitude of 548 ft AMSL. A flashing ""F RELIEF"" message was displayed at Engine Warning Display (EWD) as the TE flap was extended to 8-degree position instead of the commanded 14-degree position. With a Vmax of 205 kt, another overspeed warning was generated shortly after Flap 2 selection. The ""Too Low Terrain"" warning changed to ""Pull Up"" warning briefly at 176 ft AMSL and back to ""Too Low Terrain"" within a very short timeframe. The EGPWS warning stopped at 24 ft above the ground. During the final approach, No. 1 engine speed decreased to about 70% N1 at touchdown, with the No. 1 thrust lever at IDLE position. No. 2 engine speed remained at about 17% N1 throughout the final approach and landing. CPA780 touched down on runway 07L at 13:43 hrs at a position between abeam Taxiways A4 and A5 and with a distance of around 680 metres (m) from the beginning of the runway threshold at a ground speed of 231 kt. The landing weight was approximately 173,600 kg. The landing wind was 143 degrees at 14 kt. Immediately after both main gears touched down on the runway, the right main gear bounced and the aircraft became airborne again briefly. The aircraft then rolled left seven degrees and pitched down to -2.5 degrees at the second touchdown during which, the lower cowling of No. 1 engine contacted the runway surface. Spoilers deployed automatically. Both engine thrust reversers were selected by the Commander. Only No. 1 engine thrust reverser was deployed successfully and ECAM message ""ENG 2 REV FAULT"" was annunciated. Maximum manual braking was applied. As required by the company procedure for the purpose of drawing the PFÂs attention in the status of the deceleration devices, the co-pilot called out ""no spoilers, no REV green, no DECEL"" during the landing roll. The aircraft came to a complete stop on the runway at a position just passed Taxiway A10, with its nose wheel at about 309 m from the end of Runway 07L. The total distance for stopping the aircraft from the initial touchdown was approximately 2,630 m. The crew shut down the engines and requested the tower controller to check for a possible wheel fire. There was no sign of fire. An emergency evacuation was then ordered just after 13:45. One passenger sustained serious injuries in the evacuation while 56 passengers and six crew members sustained minor injuries. Causes: The accident was caused by fuel contamination. The contaminated fuel, which contained SAP spheres, uplifted at WARR subsequently caused the loss of thrust control on both engines of the aircraft during approach to VHHH. The following chain of events and circumstances had led to the uplift of contaminated fuel to CPA780: i. The re-commissioning of the hydrant refuelling system after the hydrant extension work in WARR had not completely removed all contaminants in the affected hydrant refuelling circuit. Salt water remained in the affected hydrant refuelling circuit.  ii. The re-commissioning of the hydrant refuelling system after the hydrant extension work in WARR was not properly coordinated which led to the premature resumption of the hydrant refuelling operations while the hydrant system still contained contaminant.  iii. The refuelling operation in WARR, in particular low flow-rate refuelling, DP recording and monitoring, did not fully comply with the international fuel industry latest guidance. iv. A number of unscheduled filter monitors replacements after the premature resumption of hydrant refuelling operation were not investigated by the fuel supplier and hydrant operator at WARR.  v. The unusual vibration observed during the refuelling of CPA780 was not stopped immediately and properly investigated by the fuel supplier personnel.  The investigation also identified the following deficiencies and contributing factors that may cause possible fuel contamination:  i. There were no established international civil aviation requirements for oversight and quality control on aviation fuel supply at airports.  ii. There were no established international civil aviation requirements for refuel operational procedures and associated training for aviation fuel supply personnel. iii. The manual monitoring of DP changes in a fuelling dispenser during refuelling was not effective.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CAD Hong Kong Report number: 2/2013 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  8 September 2016 B-HLL Cathay Dragon 0 Hong Kong-Chek Lap Kok International Airport (HKG/VHHH) min Collision with Ground support equipment Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All 103 passengers and seven crew members survived but ten sustained serious injuries. Merpati Flight MNA836 operated on a scheduled flight from Sorong-Dominique Edward Osok Airport (SOQ/WAXX). Departure was delayed for almost three hours due to heavy rain over Manokwari. The flight was planned under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR). The destination, Manokwari, had no published instrument approach procedure. Terminal area operations, including approach and landing, were required to be conducted under the Visual Flight Rules (VFR). At 10:46 the crew made the first direct contact with Rendani Radio and reported their position as 14 Nm from Manokwari, and maintaining altitude 10,500 feet. Following this radio contact, Rendani Radio informed the crew that the weather was continuous slight rain, visibility 3 kilometers, cloud overcast with cumulus-stratocumulus at 1,400 feet, temperature 24 degrees Celsius, QNH 1012 hectopascals. The controller then instructed the crew to descend and joint right downwind for runway 35, and to report when overhead the airport. Shortly after, the crew reported overhead the airport at 5,000 feet. The controller then instructed the crew to report when they were on final approach for runway 35. The crew acknowledged this instruction. At 10:54 the crew reported that they were on final for runway 35. The controller informed them that the wind was calm, runway condition was wet and clear. The crew read back the wind condition and that the runway was clear, but did not mention the wet runway condition. The aircraft was observed to make a normal touchdown on the runway, about 120 meters from the approach end of runway 35. Witnesses on the ground and on board reported that engine reverser sound was not heard during landing roll.  During the landing roll, the aircraft veered to the left about 140 meters from the end of runway 35, then overran the departure end of runway 35. It came to a stop 205 meters beyond the end of the runway in a narrow river; the Rendani River. The airport rescue and fire fighting unit was immediately deployed to assist the post-crash evacuation. Due to the steep terrain 155 meters from the end of runway 35, the rescuers had to turn back and use the airportÂs main road to reach the aircraft. The accident site was in an area of shallow muddy water surrounded by mangrove vegetation. Rendani has a single runway, 17/35, measuring 2.000 m x 30 m.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSC Report number: KNKT.10.04.09.04 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: Kementerian Perhubungan (Ministry of Transport) Indonesia   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSC; Manokwari-Rendani Airport (MKW/WASR); April 2010 photo (c) NTSC; Manokwari-Rendani Airport (MKW/WASR); April 2010 photo (c) NTSC; Manokwari-Rendani Airport (MKW/WASR); April 2010 photo (c) NTSC; Manokwari-Rendani Airport (MKW/WASR); April 2010 photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Seattle/Tacoma International Airport, WA (SEA/KSEA); September 1995 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

During the return flight to Exeter the right engine suffered a significant oil leak and lost oil pressure, so the flight crew shut it down. Subsequently, the crew noticed the left engine also leaking oil, with a fluctuating oil pressure, so they initiated a diversion to Bristol, where they landed safely. The oil leaks were traced to damaged O-ring seals within the oil cooler fittings on both engines. Both oil coolers had been removed and refitted during the base maintenance check at Exeter. It was probably during re-installation that the O-ring seals were damaged. A number of factors led to this damage and to missed oil leak checks.Sources: https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/384823/AAIB_Bulletin_6-2011.pdf History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  8 January 1993 N826MA Mesaba Aviation, Inc. 0 Detroit, MI non Images: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates24-Nov-2016 19:32 harro Added Corrections or additions? ...

A little later, during final approach, the aural warning for non-extension of landing gear sounded. The crew decided to continue the approach. On landing, the airplane exited the runway to the right and came to a stop leaning on the fuselage. Examination of the airplane showed that the landing gear was retracted with the landing gear doors open. The landing on the fuselage resulted from an incomplete analysis by the crew of the consequences of the electrical failure and the warning that triggered during the final approach. The airplane operated on a repositioning flight from New Caledonia to Wallis Island via Nadi, Fiji, in preparation for medevac flight. Causes of the Accident: At night in adverse meteorological conditions, the crew decided to continue with the approach and to land, while the landing gear was not locked in the down position due to the failure of the secondary electric circuit. The origin of this failure was probably the increase in the number of operating cycles of the hydraulic power pack which delivers the hydraulic energy required to extend and retract the landing gear. This led to the failure of the diodes in the protective secondary circuit, which could not be checked in flight.  The decision to continue the approach resulted from incorrect comprehension of the electrical failure and the aural warning that sounded during the final approach. The conviction that the landing gear was locked down, associated with the meteorological conditions and the failure of the circuit-breakers to trip, did not prompt the crew to correctly assess the risk associated with the electrical failure.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Report number: f-an100424 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 years and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Fiji Times   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were no fatalities and there was no fire. SATENA flight NSE-9634 had departed Villavicencio-La Vanguardia Airport (VVC) on a domestic flight to MitÃº. The airplane could not be stopped on the runway when it landed on MitÃº runway 20. It overran into a down sloping field, causing the undercarriage to collapse. The airplane came to rest 167 metres past the runway threshold and 4 metres below runway elevation. PROBABLE CAUSE: (translated from Spanish) The Board of Inquiry found that the probable cause of the accident was the execution of a landing on runway 20 at Mitu, following a destabilized approach especially with respect to deviations of height and speed when crossing the runway threshold, and the EGPWS alarm sound, which caused the aircraft to exceed the available runway. Additionally, the crew used  faulty techniques for landing on short and wet runways. Contributing to the accident was the lack of planning to carry out and complete the published instrument approach procedure for runway 20 and the deviation from standard operating procedures of the company.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Aerocivil Report number: COL-10-11-GIA Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Aviacol   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

On May 6 the crew carried out several flights. Before the accident flight, it was refueled with 300 liters of gasoline and 700 liters of chemicals. Takeoff weight was 4,820 kg. During takeoff, at a height of 10-15 meters, the crew heard noise from the carburetor, and then engine failed. The pilot in command performed a forced landing straight ahead on a shallow river bed. Both crew members survived.  The airplane was dismantled and the fuselage cut in two before the accident investigators reached the scene. CONCLUSION (translated from Russian): The accident of airplane AN-2 RA-40373 was the result of the nose striking the ground during the execution of a forced landing due to shutdown of the ASz-62IR engine while in the process of taking off, most likely due to ingress of water into the carburetor from the fuel system of the aircraft, which led to the shutdown of the engine. The cause of the accident was a combination of the following factors: - failure to comply with guidelines in part: checking facility for storing and dispensing aviation fuels and lubricants, monitoring and verification of the fuel sludge discharge after refueling for the lack of water and solids; - execution of a forced landing straight ahead outside the landing area on difficult terrain, covered with forests, a rugged ravine and a creek.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) MAK; Goryachy Klyuch; May 2010 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Tambo International Airport (JNB/FAOR)","Tripoli International Airport (TIP/HLLT)","Accident investigation report completed and information captured","Afriqiyah Airways flight 771, an Airbus A330-202, crashed on approach to Tripoli International Airport, Libya. There were 11 crew members and 93 passengers on board. One passenger survived the accident. On May 11, 2010 at 19:45 UTC, the aircraft departed Johannesburg-O.R. Tambo International Airport (JNB), South Africa on an international passenger flight to Tripoli. The co-pilot was pilot flying. The en route part of the flight was uneventful.  The captain contacted the Tripoli ACC controller at 05:29 local time (02:29 UTC) and received clearance direct to Tripoli for a TW locator approach to runway 09. Weather was reported as: wind calm, visibility 6 km, clear sky, temperature/dew point 19/17Â°C, QNH 1008. After receiving further descent clearances, the crew contacted the Tripoli Tower controller at 05:58. Tripoli Tower cleared the aircraft to continue the approach and to report runway in sight. The flight then received information from a flight that had landed ahead of them, informing the accident crew about fog patches noticed during short final. At 06:00 the flight passed the TW locator beacon at an altitude of 1000 feet, 200 ft below the prescribed altitude. The captain then informed ATC that he would report when runway in sight. The approach was continued below the Minimum Descent Altitude of 620 feet but the crew still did not have the runway in sight. At an altitude of 280 feet the GPWS sounded ('too low terrain'). The captain then instructed the co-pilot to execute a go-around, after which he informed the Tower controller. The aircraft began to climb, reaching an altitude of 450 feet above ground level. The Airbus then nosed down, causing the captain to take priority over the flight controls by pushing on priority button and the aircraft was fully under the captain's control who applied a sharp nose down input. The captain did not verbally state that he was taking control. He applied a pitch-up and a pitch-down input on his stick until the airplane impacted the ground 1200 m from the threshold of runway 09 with high energy (-4400 ft/min) and high longitudinal velocity (260 kts). The aircraft broke up, leaving an 800 m long wreckage trail. PROBABLE CAUSE: A final approach carried out in common managed guidance mode should have relieved the crew of their tasks. The limited coordination and cooperation between the two crew members, especially the change into vertical selected guidance mode by the PF, probably led to a lack of a common action plan. The lack of feedback from the 28 April 2010 flight, flown by the same crew on the same aircraft, did not allow them to anticipate the potential risks associated with managing non-precision approaches. The pilots'  performance was likely impaired because of fatigue, but the extent of their impairment and the degree to which it contributed to the performance deficiencies that occurred during the flight cannot be conclusively determined. During the go-around, the crew was surprised not to acquire visual references. On one hand the crew feared exceeding the aircraftÂs speed limits in relation to its configuration, and on the other hand they were feeling the effects of somatogravic illusion due to the aircraft acceleration. This probably explains the aircraft handling inputs, mainly nose-down inputs, applied during the go-around. These inputs were not consistent with what is expected in this flight phase. The degraded CRM did not make it possible for either crew member to identify and recover from the situation before the collision with the ground, even when the TAWS warnings were activated close to the ground. Based on elements from the investigation, the accident resulted from: - The lack of common action plan during the approach and a final approach continued below the MDA, without ground visual reference acquired. - The inappropriate application of flight control inputs during a go- around and on the activation of TAWS warnings, - The lack of monitoring and controlling of the flight path. These events can be explained by the following factors: - Limited CRM on approach that degraded during the missed approach. This degradation was probably amplified by numerous radio-communications during the final approach and the crewÂs state of fatigue, - Aircraft control inputs typical in the occurrence of somatogravic perceptual illusions, - Inappropriate systematic analysis of flight data and feedback mechanism within the AFRIQIYAH Airways. - Non adherence to the company operation manual, SOP and standard terminology. In addition, the investigation committee found the following as contributing factors to the accident: - Weather available to the crew did not reflect the actual weather situation in the final approach segment at Tripoli International Airport. - In adequacy of training received by the crew. - Occupancy of tower frequency by both air and ground movements control.METAR: 03:50 UTC / 05:20 local time: HLLT 120350Z VRB01KT 6000 NSC 19/17 Q1008=03:50 UTC; Winds variable at 1 knot; visibility 6000 m; Temperature 19Â°C; Dew point 17Â°C; Ceiling unlimited; 1008 hPa04:20 UTC / 06:20 local time: HLLT 120420Z 27007KT 5000 BR NSC 19/17 Q1009=04:20 UTC; Winds 270 degrees at 7 knots; visibility 5000 m; Temperature 19Â°C; Dew point 17Â°C; Ceiling unlimited; 1009 hPaAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: CAA Libya Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   Afriqiyah statement   Location  Images: photo (c) Dutch Safety Board; Tripoli International Airport (TIP/HLLT); May 2010 photo (c) Google; Tripoli International Airport (TIP/HLLT); 13 May 2010 photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG/LFPG); October 2009 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Postflight inspection revealed that approximately twelve feet of the right wing inboard fore flap was missing and had caused substantial damage to the aft fuselage. The separated section of the fore flap was recovered and examined. The examination revealed that a large portion of the enamel was missing from the fore flap attachment fitting of the carriage assembly and that there was a large amount of contamination and grease buildup around the lubrication fitting. Extensive corrosion byproducts covered up the lubrication passage in the attachment, which prevented passage of grease to the bearing, causing extensive corrosion in the bore and propagated by fatigue before final ductile separation.

There were six crew members and 38 passengers on board, according to a government spokesman. Heavy fog was reported in the area. Aircrews from the Afghan National Army Air Corps (ANAAC) and ISAF located the wreckage May 19. The site is located at approximately 13,500 feet (4,100 m) in Shakar Darah district, Kabul Province. The wreckage was scattered over the mountainside. According to Al Jazeera the airline bought the plane 3 months ago from Bulgaria. Soviet Transports Fleet data indicate that YA-PIS was recently acquired by Pamir after a period of storage in Bulgaria. An inquest was held at Bradford Crown Court, U.K. because three British men were on the plane. During the inquest it was reported that an early ground proximity warning system was misunderstood by the crew, either due to language problems or because of previous false alerts. Also, the Kabul air traffic controller asked the crew to maintain their current altitude but the plane began its descent in bad weather into a mountainous area about 12 miles from Kabul.Sources: Al Jazeera  BBC  Pamir Airways statement  Afghan Army and ISAF Planning Recovery Operations (NATO 20-5-2010)  The Yorkshire Post, 24-6-2015   Location  Images: photo (c) Dimitar Nozharov; Salang Pass; 19 May 2010 photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; MÃ¼nchen-Franz Josef Strauss Airport (MUC/EDDM); January 2005 photo (c) Ferenc HAMORI, via Miklos SZABO; Budapest-Ferihegy Airport (BUD/LHBP); 26 September 2006 photo (c) VÃ¡clav Kudela; Ostrava-MoÅ¡nov International Airport (OSR/LKMT); 30 August 2005 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane was put on a 5 to 8 mile final as the pilot read and quickly completed the checklist. The airplane was configured with full flaps and when the pilot went to actuate the landing gear he diverted his attention to his deteriorating airspeed and glide path deviation. The pilot made the necessary correction to stabilize the approach. At 500 feet above the ground, the pilot glanced over to the gear indicator and thought he saw ""three down."" The pilot continued the approach and the airplane landed with the gear in the retracted position. Neither pilot reported hearing the gear warning horn which should have actuated when the pilot selected greater than half flaps and the gear was not properly configured.

Both pilots escaped unhurt. The airplane operated on a cargo flight from Sorocaba Airport to Cascavel. Weather at the destination was poor with limited visibility in fog and a 100 ft overcast. The crew attempted to land, but touched down in a soy bean field about 700 m from the runway 33 threshold. The airplane traveled about 150 meters before coming to rest on its belly. The only navigational aid available at Cascavel is NDB. Contributing Factors 1 Human Factor 1.1 Medical Aspect a) Fatigue - undetermined It is probable that fatigue occurred, considering that the day before the accident, the crew performed a journey longer than 24 hours, which would be 16 hours, taking into account the type of crew, as well as the rest time. b) Visual illusions - contributed It is possible that the crew landed before the runway due to false sensory impressions generated by the dark environment surrounding the aerodrome and the low visibility conditions at the time of the accident (black hole effect). 1.2 Psychological Aspect 1.2.1 Individual Information a) Attitude - contributed Excessive self-confidence in equipment and mission influenced the takeoff of Sorocaba in weather conditions unfavorable to landing in Cascavel. b) Motivation - contributed The pilot demonstrated to be adapted to the work environment and the flight routine, however he showed a high motivation to fulfill the mission as it was programmed, in order to cause the minimum of interference in the aerial programming of the company. (c) Decision-making - contributed The pilots operated at night, a condition that in itself modifies visual perception, although the pilot in command was adapted to routine and recognized that their cognitive abilities could be diminished. In addition, the flight was accompanied by difficulties, such as adverse weather conditions, making it difficult to see and to process information. These conditions added to the stress of the situation compromised the judgment and the decision. 1.2.2 Psychosocial Information a) Team dynamics - contributed The aircraft commander did not request the support of the co-pilot to carry out the descent procedure, took over the operation and intended to make the landing, despite the weather. The co-pilot, being inexperienced, trusted the commander and did not interfere, despite realizing the dangerous conditions. 1.2.3 Organizational Information a) Physical conditions of work - indeterminate Work shifts that generate changes in routines very often require the need for constant physiological adaptations. This condition can lead to the development of fatigue, creating favorable conditions for human error. b) Organizational culture - contributed Flexibility is observed with respect to compliance with flight rules, with low levels of knowledge and application of flight safety strategies. The company was compliant with the changes in operating procedures. c) Training, Training and Training - contributed There was a fragile process of training and qualification of new pilots, with deficient monitoring of personnel and the use of missions to train the crew. d) Organization of work - indeterminate The aerial activity of the company consisted in the service to fixed clients, being important the conservation of the routines of work, to well serve the users. This caused that changes in the meteorological conditions generated much disorder, since the routes had to be altered, generating costs and time. The crew, on the other hand, probably tried to minimize the interpretation of the adversities in order to force the execution of the planned activity. e) Organizational processes - undetermined There may have been a lack of continuous supervision of the aerial activity of the different flights underway. 1.3 Operational Aspect 1.3.1 Concerning the operation of the aircraft a) Coordination of cabin - contributed It became evident that communication between the crew was compromised by inadequate management of the tasks assigned to each one, probably due to the difference between the high experience of the pilot in command and the lack of experience of the co-pilot. b) Flight Discipline - contributed The crew intentionally violated operational rules, regulations and air traffic regulations without any justification for doing so. c) Influence of the environment - undetermined The region near the threshold of runway 33 had visibility-limiting environmental conditions, as it was an area of low demographic density, almost unlMETAR: 08:00 UTC / 05:00 local time: SBCA 190800Z 33015KT 1200 -DZ BR PRFG OVC001 08/08 Q1014=Wind 330 degrees at 15 knots; visibility 1200m; light drizzle, mist, partial fog; overcast at 100 ft; temperature 8Â°C, dew point 8Â°C; 1014 hPa09:00 UTC / 06:00 local time: SBCA 190900Z 32012KT 2000 -DZ BR PRFG OVC001 08/08 Q1014=Wind 320 degrees at 12 knots; visibility 2000m; light drizzle, mist, partial fog; overcast at 100 ft; temperature 8Â°C, dew point 8Â°C; 1014 hPaAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: CENIPA Report number: A - 034/CENIPA/2012 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: AviÃ£o tenta pousar em aeroporto fechado e acaba em fazenda em Cascavel (PR) (Folha Online)  Edson Dantas   Location  Images: photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Rio de Janeiro-Santos Dumont Airport, RJ (SDU/SBRJ); January 1979 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

It struck concrete blocks, runway lights and then bounced. It impacted the runway nose-first. The captain ordered the props to be unlocked so they would go into ground fine pitch. However, the throttle of engine no. 4 was still at 42% with the other engines below 20%. An asymmetric thrust condition occurred as the no. 4 engine consequently did not go into ground fine pitch. This caused the plane to drift to the left side. It passed over a gravel road, then lost the left main landing gear, turned to left and broke the right hand main landing gear and nose gear before it stopped.

The wreckage came to rest on the west bank of the Des Plaines River, in a forest preserve south of the airport. Both pilots were killed in the accident. The flight departed Pontiac-Oakland County International Airport, MI (PTK) at 13:35 and was scheduled to pickup cargo at Chicago-Executive Airport, IL (PWK). During the descent and 14 minutes before the accident, the airplane encountered a layer of moderate rime ice. The captain, who was the pilot flying, and the first officer, who was the monitoring pilot, made multiple statements which were consistent with their awareness and presence of airframe icing. After obtaining visual flight rules conditions, the flight crew cancelled the instrument flight rules clearance and continued with a right, circling approach to runway 34. While turning into the base leg of the traffic pattern, and 45 seconds prior to the accident, the captain called for full flaps and the engine power levers were adjusted several times between 50 and 95 percent. In addition, the captain inquired about the autopilot and fuel balance. In response, the first officer stated that he did not think that the spoilerons were working. Shortly thereafter, the first officer gave the command to add full engine power and the airplane impacted terrain. There was no evidence of flight crew impairment or fatigue in the final 30 minutes of the flight. The cockpit voice recorder showed multiple instances during the flight in which the airplane was below 10,000 feet mean sea level that the crew was engaged in discussions that were not consistent with a sterile cockpit environment, for example a lengthy discussion about Class B airspeeds, which may have led to a relaxed and casual cockpit atmosphere. In addition, the flight crew appears to have conducted checklists in a generally informal manner. As the flight was conducted by a Part 135 operator, it would be expected that both pilots were versed with the importance of sterile cockpit rules and the importance of adhering to procedures, including demonstrating checklist discipline. For approximately the last 24 seconds of flight, both pilots were likely focusing their attention on activities to identify and understand the reason for the airplane's roll handling difficulties, as noted by the captain's comment related to the fuel balance. These events, culminating in the first officer's urgent command to add full power, suggested that neither pilot detected the airplane's decaying energy state before it reached a critical level for the conditions it encountered.

The pilot diverted to the nearest airstrip, which was Beagle Bay, WA. The pilot shut the engine down when the low oil pressure warning light illuminated and conducted a landing at Beagle Bay airstrip. The aircraft overran the airstrip, coming to rest upside down after impacting a mound of dirt. The aircraft was seriously damaged. The pilot, who was the only occupant, sustained minor injuries. From the evidence available it was evident that the engine had a substantial in-flight oil leak, which necessitated the in-flight shut down of the engine and a diversion to the nearest available airstrip.  The accident damage to the engine in the area of the apparent oil leak precluded a conclusive finding as to the source of the leak. Although the detailed examination of the oil tube attachment lug fracture surfaces was inconclusive, the oil tube remained the most likely source of the oil leak. Evidence from other oil tube failures indicated that significant vibratory loading can cause the oil tube attachment lugs to fracture in the manner observed in the oil tube fitted to VH-NTQ. There was no evidence that the transfer tube was subjected to vibration from a compressor turbine or power turbine blade failure or  of an incorrectly fitted engine mount. There was also no evidence of a pre-accident defect that would have caused a reduction in actual engine torque.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ATSB Report number: AO-2010-003 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: ATSB AO-2010-003   Location  Images: photo (c) Western Australia Police; Beagle Bay Airport, WA (BEE); January 2010 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Bud Day Field (SUX), Iowa. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The pilot, copilot, and two passengers were uninjured. The pilot filed an instrument-flight-rules (IFR) flight plan with the destination and alternate airports, both of which were below weather minimums. The pilot and copilot departed from Des Moines Airport in weather minimums that were below the approach minimums for the departure airport. While en route, the destination airport's automated observing system continued to report weather below approach minimums, but the flight crew continued the flight. The flight crew then requested and were cleared for the instrument landing system (ILS) 31 approach and while on that approach were issued visibilities of 1,800 feet runway visual range after changing to tower frequency. During landing, the copilot told the pilot that he was not lined up with the runway. The pilot reportedly said, ""those are edge lights,"" and then realized that he was not properly lined up with the runway. The airplane then touched down beyond a normal touchdown point, about 2,800 feet down the runway, and off the left side of the runway surface. The airplane veered to the left, collapsing the nose landing gear.  The company's procedures did not allow flight crew to depart to an airport that was below minimums but did allow for the flight crew, at their discretion, to perform a ""look-see"" approach to approach minimums if the weather was below minimums. The allowance of a ""look see"" approach essentially negates the procedural risk mitigation afforded by requiring approaches to be conducted only when weather was above approach minimums. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The flight crew's decision to attempt a flight that was below takeoff, landing, and alternate airport weather minimums, which led to a touchdown off the runway surface by the pilot-in-command.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN10LA105 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Sioux Gateway Airport, IA (SUX); 19 January 2010; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Sioux Gateway Airport, IA (SUX); 19 January 2010; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Sioux Gateway Airport, IA (SUX); January 2010; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Sioux Gateway Airport, IA (SUX); January 2010; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft's actual departure time in Barcelona was 11:13 local time. At 12:40, flight CLX 793 contacted Luxembourg Approach (APP) for the first time and was advised by the approach controller that Low Visibility Procedures (LVP) were in operation.  Fog prevailed at Luxembourg airport with a cloud base at 100 feet overcast and a visibility of 100 meters, temperature and dew point were at 1Â°C.  The aircraft was cleared for an ILS approach on runway 24 at 12:49. RVR readings were 350/275/375 meters. At 12:50:55, CLX 793 reported established on the localiser for runway 24 and was transferred to Tower. RVR readings had decreased to 350/250/350 meters.  CLX 793 contacted Luxembourg Tower (TWR) at 12:51:40 and reported established on the ILS 24. The Tower Controller then cleared them to land.  At 12:53:46, reaching decision height at 17 ft, the Pilot Flying called out 'landingÂ. During the flare, the airplane impacted a maintenance van 'ELE 23' positioned slightly to the right of the centreline of runway 24 and about 340 meters from the threshold, with the front-end pointing into the opposite direction (060Â°). The roofline of the van was at a height of 2.54 m (8 ft). The right hand body landing gear of the Boeing 747-400F impacted the roof of ELE 23 with tire no. 12 slightly below the roofline of the van on a backward sloped roof section and rolled over it, damaging the roof on the whole length of the vehicle. The van's lightbar, as well as its R/T antennas, were ripped off on impact. The maintenance crew working on the centreline lights outside of ELE 23 ran off the side of the runway as soon as they noticed an increasing noise from a landing aircraft.  The aircraft landed safely at 12:53:51.  After touchdown, at 12:53:59, the Pilot Flying mentioned to the Pilot Monitoring (PM) that there was a car in the touchdown zone. The PM, monitoring the instruments during landing in accordance  with company procedures, didn't notice it.  The aircraft vacated runway 24 at taxiway Echo and at 12:56:28, while taxiing to apron P7, the PF informed the Tower controller about a car in the touchdown zone. The controller asked if there was a problem and the PF denied. The aircraft continued to the parking position on apron P7 without further incident. Causal and contributory factors:  - The impaired operational readiness of the ELE department due to a manning shortcoming, combined with the lack of provisions to appoint external workforce if necessary, prevented ANA to schedule preventive maintenance work outside of normal operating hours (i.e. during the curfew);  - The decision to carry out preventive maintenance work in low visibility conditions without hampering air traffic gave priority to flight operations over safety aspects;  - The lack of adequate co-ordination between aerodrome control tower and ELE department with regard to the preventive maintenance work contributed to a reduced situational and organizational awareness of the TWR control staff;  - Inadequate procedures for the access of vehicles to the RWY and ILS sensitive area during LVP contributed to the development of an unsafe condition;  - Read-back procedures were not adequately applied by aerodrome control tower on ground control frequency, making this procedural safety net ineffective;  - Low visibility weather conditions, associated with the lack of supplementary ground traffic control and surveillance equipment, limited the capability of aerodrome control tower to identify and correct a developing unsafe condition;  - The use of different frequencies for air traffic and ground traffic on the manoeuvring area reduced the situational awareness of ELE 23 maintenance crew working on the RWY, preventing them to take avoiding action.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ATI Report number: AET-2012/AC-01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  14 May 2023 LX-OCV Cargolux 0 Luxembourg-Findel Airport (LUX) sub Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The captain and one of the passengers were killed. The co-pilot and seven passengers survived. The aircraft was en route from BelÃ©m/Val-de-CÃ£es International Airport in Brazil to Senador JosÃ© PorfÃ­rio at an altitude of 2500 feet when the no.1 engine showed an increase in TIT (Turbine Inlet Temperature). The captain throttled back the engine, but the aircraft was not able to maintain altitude. The crew attempted to locate their destination airport but were unable. A forced landing was carried out 4 km from the airport. Contributing Factors: 1 Human Factor 1.1 Medical Aspect Not contributing. 1.2 Psychological Aspect 1.2.1 Individual Information A) Attitude - contributed There was disregard for the procedures, since the pilots did not use the checklist for the emergency situation. 1.2.2 Psychosocial Information A) Culture of the working group - undetermined It is possible that the informal rules, shared by some pilots, regarding the use of the checklist, have influenced the behavior of the pilot to decline its use. 1.2.3 Organizational Information A) Organizational culture - contributed The company evidenced to have an organizational culture based on the informality of the adopted procedures, from the planning to the maintenance of the aircraft, which compromised the safe accomplishment of the operation. B) Organizational processes - contributed The company did not have an effective supervision system, allowing the aircraft to be used under inadequate conditions. 1.3 Operational Aspect 1.3.1 Concerning the operation of the aircraft A) Adverse weather conditions - contributed The meteorological conditions at the time of the occurrence made it difficult for the crew to locate the aerodrome, causing the aircraft to move away from the approach path to the runway which, added to the drag produced by the unfeathered propeller, aggravated the flight situation, contributing to the forced landing. B) Coordination of cabin - contributed The fact that the crew had been searching for the aerodrome, now turning their attention to the passenger who went to the cabin of the aircraft, or turning the attention to the engine failure, caused inattention as to the use of the checklist, resulting in non-compliance and failure to perform prescribed procedures, such as not feathering the left propeller by the propeller lever. This made it difficult to maintain the flight, because the windmilling propeller caused drag, culminating in the forced landing. C) Pilot trial - contributed The fact that the commander of the aircraft did not follow the procedures foreseen in the checklist, as suggested by the co-pilot after the engine failure, was decisive for the maintenance of the windmilling propeller, causing a drag that made it difficult to maintain the flight, contributing to forced landing. D) Maintenance of the aircraft - contributed The fact that the aircraft operator did not comply with the ANAC guidance related to the left engine condition with the overdue TBO, as well as not having identified the maintenance services performed and defined as not recommended by the manufacturer, contributed that the left engine was operated with the inappropriate governor connection, which resulted in loss of power in flight. E) Management oversight - contributed Supervision of aircraft maintenance activities was not adequate, allowing the aircraft to operate with nonconformities and culminating in in-flight engine failure. 1.3.2 Concerning ATS organs Not contributing. 2 Material Factor 2.1 Concerning the aircraft Not contributing. 2.2 Concerning equipment and technology systems for ATS Not contributing.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CENIPA Report number: A-122/CENIPA/2012 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Piquiatuba TÃ¡xi AÃ©reo   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All 82 passengers and eight crew members were killed. The airplane operated on Ethiopian Airlines flight ET409 from Beirut International Airport (BEY) to Addis Ababa-Bole Airport (ADD). Instruments meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, and the flight was on an instrument flight plan. It was night in dark lighting conditions with reported isolated cumulonimbus clouds and thunderstorms in the area. Flight ET409 was initially cleared by ATC on a LATEB 1 D Standard Instrument Departure (SID) from runway 21. Just before takeoff, ATC changed the clearance to an ""immediate right turn direct Chekka"". The Boeing 737 took off from runway 21 at 02:36. After takeoff ATC instructed ET409 to turn right on a heading of 315Â° and change frequencies and contact Beirut Control. ET409 acknowledged the clearance and continued a right turn. ATC instructed ET409 to turn left heading 270Â°, which was acknowledged. The flight continued the climbing left turn to heading 270Â° but did not maintain that heading. The aircraft continued on a southerly track. Just prior to reaching altitude of 7700 feet, the stick shaker activated, sounding for a period of 29 seconds. Meanwhile the airplane reached an angle of attack (AOA) of 32Â° and began a descent to 6000 feet. When the stick shaker ceased, the aircraft began to climb again. At 02:40:56, just prior to reaching 9000 feet, the stick shaker activated again, sounding for a period of 26 seconds. After reaching 9000 feet the aircraft made a sharp left turn and descended rapidly. The maximum registered bank angle was 118Â° left and the airplane reached a maximum registered speed was 407.5 knots at a G load of 4.412. The airplane disappeared from the radar screen and crashed into the Mediterranean Sea at 02:41:30. PROBABLE CAUSES: 1- The flight crew's mismanagement of the aircraft's speed, altitude, headings and attitude through inconsistent flight control inputs resulting in a loss of control. 2- The flight crew failure to abide by CRM principles of mutual support and calling deviations hindered any timely intervention and correction. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1- The manipulation of the flight controls by the flight crew in an ineffective manner resulted in the aircraft undesired behavior and increased the level of stress of the pilots. 2- The aircraft being out of trim for most of the flight directly increased the workload on the pilot and made his control of the aircraft more demanding. 3- The prevailing weather conditions at night most probably resulted in spatial disorientation to the flight crew and lead to loss of situational awareness. 4- The relative inexperience of the Flight Crew on type combined with their unfamiliarity with the airport contributed, most likely, to increase the Flight Crew workload and stress. 5- The consecutive flying (188 hours in 51 days) on a new type with the absolute minimum rest could have likely resulted in a chronic fatigue affecting the captain's performance. 6- The heavy meal discussed by the crew prior to take-off has affected their quality of sleep prior to that flight. 7- The aircraft 11 bank angle aural warnings, 2 stalls and final spiral dive contributed in the increase of the crew workload and stress level. 8- Symptoms similar to those of a subtle incapacitation have been identified and could have resulted from and/or explain most of the causes mentioned above. However, there is no factual evidence to confirm without any doubt such a cause. 9- The F/O reluctance to intervene did not help in confirming a case of captain's subtle incapacitation and/or to take over control of the aircraft as stipulated in the operator's SOP.METAR: 00:00 UTC / 02:00 local time: OLBA 250000Z 31008KT 280V340 8000 VCTS FEW020CB SCT026 13/06 Q1014 NOSIG= wind 310 degrees at 8 knots, variable from 280Â° to 340Â°; visibility 8km; thunderstorms in the vicinity; few clouds with cumulonimbus at 2,000 ft; scattered clouds at 2,600 ft; temperature 13 degrees C, dew point 6 degrees C, pressure 1014 hPa01:00 UTC / 03:00 local time: OLBA 250100Z VRB03KT 4000 SHRA FEW020CB BKN026 12/07 Q1014 NOSIG=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MoPW&T Report number: - Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   BBC  AlArabiya  OLBA (Beirut) SID departure charts   Location  Images: photo (c) Lebanon CAA / BEA photo (c) Lebanon CAA / BEA photo (c) Neil Randell; Lasham Airport (QLA/EGHL); 11 July 2009 photo (c) Werner Fischdick; London-Stansted Airport (STN/EGSS); 12 July 2006 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

At around 18:53 local time, the crew began the descent for an ILS approach to runway 09 at Grenoble Airport, France. It was a dark night with the moon still below the horizon. The crew was established on the localizer at about 10 nm from the runway threshold and had the runway in sight. At 19:23, at a height of approximately 1500 ft, the undercarriage was deployed at an indicated airspeed (IAS) 157 kt.  At a height of about 1000 ft, the crew disengaged the autopilot. The aircraft was stabilized at a slightly higher speed than Vapp, on the glide path and with a vertical speed of -700 ft/min. At a height of approximately 200 ft, the pilot flying disconnected the auto-throttle. The approach remained stabilized on the 3Â° glide path at a speed equal to Vapp + 3 kt and a descent rate of 700 ft/min until a height of 100 ft. Passing 100 ft, the IAS started to decrease and went below Vapp. The rate of descent increased to 850 ft/min. The pitch was 4Â° and the nose started to lift slightly. At a height of 30 ft, the plane passed slightly below the glide slope at an IAS of Vapp -4 kt. At a height of 15 ft, the elevator was operated abruptly causing a rapid increase in pitch attitude. Two seconds later, the rear fuselage touched down, with a pitch of 10.7Â°. The traces left on the runway indicate a contact point 166 meters before the touchdown zone. The vertical acceleration value reached a maximum of 1.95 g. Two seconds later, the throttles were brought back and the thrust reversers were deployed. The aircraft then rolled to the apron. CAUSE (translated from French): The accident was caused by continuing the landing when the situational awareness of the crew had deteriorated. This led to an inaccurate estimate of the height from the end point of the trajectory and no flare. The following factors contributed to the accident: - The crew did not select the maximum illumination of the landing lights; - Runway 09 at the Grenoble-IsÃ¨re airport is not equipped with visual indicator approach slope; - Management of the manual throttles to land was inadequate.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Report number: oy-p100206 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All six crew members and 46 passengers survived the accident. The domestic passenger flight TGN162 departed Tanjung Redep/Berau-Kalimaru Airport (BEJ) at 10:30 and climbed to Flight Level (FL) 140. Balikpapan approach cleared the crew direct to Samarinda Airport (SRI). The enroute part of the flight was uneventful. On approach to Samarinda, the crew was cleared to track direct to left downwind for runway 04. The controller informed them that the wind was 060 degrees at 12 knots. During the final approach for runway 04, the left ECU (Engine Control Unit) light illuminated followed by low oil pressure and torque indications. The captain decided to go around and divert to Balikpapan-Sepingan Airport (BPN) which was 92 km (50 NM) to the South. The flight crew carried out the engine shut-down procedure and commenced a climb to 4000 ft with the left engine inoperative. Approximately 16 Nm from Balikpapan Airport, while climbing through 3,800 feet, the right ECU light illuminated, immediately followed by low oil pressure and low torque indications. The right engine then failed. The crew broadcast a MAYDAY to Balikpapan Approach and decided to conduct a forced landing into a clear field in the Samboja area, about 16 Nm from the Balikpapan Airport. CAUSES: ""The both engine were lack of fuel before flame out, it was indicated the fuel management was out of control during flight that might be a misleading of fuel quantity indication.

The extreme turbulence encounter caused a brief loss of control that lasted less than a minute. The airplane then made an uneventful descent and landing. A postflight inspection of the airplane revealed overstress damage that caused wrinkling and debonding on both wings. The synoptic surface weather chart for the flight identified an area of high pressure to the west and an area of low pressure to the east. These conditions were conducive to mountain wave turbulence. An inflight weather advisory was in effect for moderate turbulence, icing, and mountain obscuration for the accident location and altitude. Low-level significant weather charts advised of moderate or greater turbulence below 20,000 feet for the accident region. Pilot reports in the area near the time of the turbulence event indicated moderate levels of turbulence above 10,000 feet. The preflight weather information obtained by the flight crew did not include available information about the turbulence forecasts or the pilot reports of turbulence.

During the turn, the flight crew received a traffic alert and collision avoidance system resolution advisory (RA). The captain responded to the RA by initiating an estimated 1,500- to 2,000-foot-per-minute rate of descent followed by an approximate 2,000-foot-per-minute climb. During the RA response maneuvers, three flight attendants were standing in the aft galley, one of whom was seriously injured. Probable Cause: The pilot's abrupt airplane pitch change maneuver.

Both pilots were killed. Flight TIE039C departed Prague-Ruzyne International Airport (PRG) at 20:08 on an IFR flight to Karlstad Airport (KSD), Sweden. The copilot was Pilot Flying. At 20:14, while the airplane was climbing to cruising altitude, the copilot asked the captain if she had ever flown a roll at night. Meanwhile, the air traffic controller at Prague cleared the flight to climb to FL260.  The flightcrew continued their conversation about performing a roll with Citation Bravo jets. At 20:17 the Pilot Flying rolled the 30Â° to the left and immediately 20Â° to the right. Prague ATC then instructed the flight to contact Munich ATC. Contact was established and clearance was given to climb from FL260 to FL330. This was confirmed by the crew. At 20:18 the captain asked the copilot if their altitude was high enough to perform a roll. The copilot confirmed that the altitude was sufficient. At 20:19 the flight levelled off at FL270. Five seconds later the nose pitched up to 14Â° and a roll to the right was initiated. Within four seconds the airplane was flying upside down. It rolled a further 90Â° in the next four seconds. Meanwhile the heading began to change and the nose dropped in an almost vertical dive of -85Â°. The computed airspeed increased from about 240 knots at the initiation of the roll to 380 knots during the descent. The flight crew were not able to recover and the airplane impacted a forest. CAUSES (translated from German): The accident is due to the fact that: - The crew attempted to perform maneuvers (roll) that are not planned for in commercial aviation. - The crew lost spatial orientation and subsequently the skill for a controlled recovery from the attained attitude. The following factors have contributed: - The pilots were not trained in aerobatics. - Night-time conditions existed, thereby lacking visual references. - The personal relationship between two pilots led to a lack of professional behavior while working together in the cockpit. - The aircraft was not designed or approved for aerobatics.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BFU Report number: BFU CX001-10 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) VÃ¡clav Kudela; Praha-Ruzyne International Airport (PRG/LKPR); 31 July 2005 photo (c) VÃ¡clav Kudela; Praha-Ruzyne International Airport (PRG/LKPR); 01 August 2005 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

For safety reasons, the pilot chose to fly straight ahead for 8 miles to Kongiganak, Alaska, where the flight landed without further difficulty. The right wing required a major repair to restore it to airworthy condition. A postaccident inspection disclosed no mechanical anomalies with the engine or its accessories, and the airplane was flown to its base after the wing was repaired without any engine problems noted. A weather study by a Safety Board meteorologist determined that the area was subject to light snow showers, freezing fog and mist, and surface temperatures below freezing, all conducive to wing/airframe icing. During an interview with Federal Aviation Administration inspectors, the pilot acknowledged seeing ""a trace of ice"" on the wings. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The pilot's decision to take off with ice-contaminated wings in freezing rain and mist, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ANC10LA019 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  2 September 2011 N207DR Grant Aviation 1 14 km N of Nightmute, AK w/o Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Of the 243 passengers and 19 crew members on board, 17 passengers and eight flight attendants (FA) received minor injuries and one FA received a serious injury.  The airplane received minor damaged.  The flight was operating under 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 121 as a regularly scheduled international passenger flight from Dulles International Airport (IAD), Washington, DC, to Narita International Airport (NRT), Narita, Japan. Prior to the turbulence encounter, the flight crew received pilot reports (PIREPs) of moderate to severe turbulence above FL340 and that it was less at FL300.  According to the flight crew, about one hour late, the flight began to encounter a few ""light bumps"" or intermittent light ""chop."" The sky conditions were clear with good visibility. The captain turned on the ""fasten seat belt"" sign and made a public address (PA) announcement to fasten seat belts. The flight crew requested a descent to FL300 and began to encounter moderate turbulence after starting the descent.  The first officer then made a PA announcement directing the flight attendants to ""take your seats."" The autopilot remained engaged throughout the turbulence encounter, which lasted less than one minute.   After encountering the turbulence, the crew assessed airplane damage and checked the number and severity of injuries to passengers and crew.  The crew was assisted in assessing passenger and crew injuries by a U.S. Army Special Forces medic who stated that all of the injuries were considered minor. All the FAs indicated that they were able to perform their required emergency duties for the remainder of the flight. After discussing the injuries and the available diversion airports with the FAs, company dispatch and the medic, the flight crew decided to continue on to NRT since there were sufficient diversion airports along the route if the situation worsened. Upon arrival in NRT, 16 passengers and one FA were transported to hospitals for medical evaluation.  All were released with only minor injuries, however, the FA was re-evaluated by her personal physician when she returned home with the further diagnosis of a fractured rib.

The aircraft had departed from Dar es Salaam. The en route part of the flight was uneventful. At 07:22 hours the flight contacted the Mwanza Tower controller and requested information about the location of the CB cloud which had earlier been mentioned by another aircraft in the area. Mwanza Tower informed the flight that there was a CB lying north east of the airport. The relevant METAR weather information was also transmitted to the flight. The pilot subsequently requested to use runway 30 and was cleared to do so. By that time the wind was 030Âº/18 kt and the visibility was 10 km. The aircraft proceeded to make a visual approach to the airfield and later reported field in sight. The captain was flying the aircraft. He testified that the approach to runway 30 and touchdown were all normal. He also claimed that after reverse thrust was selected, the aircraft entered a puddle of water that adversely affected its performance and controllability and caused it to veer off the runway. After covering 305 metres on grass, the aircraft came to rest on grass off the left edge of runway 30 some 1450 metres from the threshold. About 5 metres of the right wing was protruding into the runway and the nose section was resting on the tarmac surface of a service road.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIB Tanzania Report number: CAV/ACC/4/10 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: ippmedia.com, 14-3-2010   Location  Images: photo (c) anon.; Mwanza Airport (MWZ/HTMW); 01 March 2010 photo (c) Hansueli Krapf; Mwanza Airport (MWZ/HTMW); 14 September 2010; (sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The unlit light was the left main gear lock indication. Five seconds later, the green hydraulic system pressure and level read zero. The crew declared an emergency and made their approach at minimum speed. During braking, the left main gear collapsed backwards. The aircraft went off the left side of the runway and came to rest on a strip of land 2000 meters past the runway threshold. The five crew members evacuated the aircraft without any problems. Causes of the accident: Fatigue cracking led to the failure of the left main gear hinge arm. This cracking was most probably initiated by a corrosion pit, which appeared and/or was not detected during the last general overhaul. The origin of this corrosion pitting could not be clearly identified. However, the investigation revealed certain deficiencies in the maintenance tasks carried out during the general overhaul of the gear. The implementation of incomplete and inadequate work cards and tracking sheets in the workshop may have contributed to the accident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Report number: tc-b100301 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 years and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Pprune  OIAX Notam   Location  Images: photo (c) U.S. Air Force photo by/Tech.

The airplane continued to its intended destination of Taipei-Taoyuan International Airport (TPE/RCTP), Taiwan. There were no injuries to the crew, and the airplane received substantial damage. When entering the required data into Runway Analysis System, the pilot took the Max Landing Weight as Max Take-Off Weight obtained from Computerized Flight Plan; which led the calculation to provide erroneous take-off thrust, take-off reference speed and take-off model. The aircraft did not obtain enough lift required for take-off, the angles of ground and attack were too large; which caused that the tail had ground contact. During the take-off roll, the pilot had stick shaker warning, then released stick and set the manual thrust to MAX to continue the take-off. In the air the pilot inspected the instruments of cabin pressure and engines which were normal. After landing at 16:48, maintenance personnel checked and found the rear section of aircraft belly had substantial damage Findings Related to Probable Causes: 1. When entering the required data into Runway Analysis System, CM 1 used the data from Computerized Flight Plan but took the max landing weight mistakenly as max take-off weight. Then CM 2 did not cross check to confirm the accuracy of the input data, and did not review all the data after retrieving take off performance figures from Runway Analysis System; so it was not discovered that the max take-off weight that was entered by mistake caused the mal-calculation of take-off thrust, -reference speed and -model. 2. CM 2 entered the erroneous take-off thrust provided by Runway Analysis System into Flight Management System which failed to calculate take-off reference speed; so the columns of V1, VR ,V2 on the page of the take-off speed showed Â- - - Â and the pilot did not understand the meaning of Â- - - Â, at the end he decided to use the take-off reference speed calculated by Runway Analysis System to enter into Flight Management System. 3. CM 3 has checked Runway Analysis Manual during taxiing to verify the accuracy of the calculation done by Runway Analysis System. However the source of Âmax take-off weightÂ was from the system and not from Weight and Balance Sheet nor Computerized Flight Plan. Therefore it was discovered that the take-off reference speed calculated by Runway Analysis System was much lower than the actual figure that the aircraft should have used. 4. When taking off the aircraft speed reached the VR value calculated by Runway Analysis System, 2 seconds later the aircraft started to roll. Because the actual roll speed of 149 knots/hour was lower than the correct value of 166 knots/hour, the aircraft did not have enough lift required for take-off and angles of ground and attack way too large; which caused the aircraft tail to touch ground.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ASC Report number: ASC-AOR-11-05-001 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft was tracking on a GURAK 3 standard instrument departure, which involved transiting through Pearce military controlled airspace. While maintaining flight level (FL) 120 and turning left onto a heading of 330 degrees under the control of Pearce air traffic control (ATC), the crew received a traffic advisory (TA) warning from the traffic alert and collision avoidance system (TCAS). The crew advised ATC and were instructed to continue the turn onto a heading of 360 degrees. During the turn, the crew received a resolution advisory (RA). The crew responded and climbed the aircraft to FL125. The crew were advised by ATC that the conflicting aircraft, a military-operated Raytheon Aircraft Company 350 (King Air) descending through FL120 on a reciprocal track, had the 717 in sight and was maintaining separation. By this time, the radar separation standard had reduced below the required distance of 3 NM (5.6 km). This occurrence reinforces the importance of effective coordination between ATC positions, and highlights the challenges faced by air traffic controllers when managing aircraft operating within the same airspace, but under the control of different ATC positions.Sources: ATSB AO-2010-014  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates24-Jul-2023 12:13 harro Updated Corrections or additions? ...

The flight departed Palm Beach, Florida on March 7 and made refueling stops at Aguadilla, Puerto Rico and Manaus, Brazil. During takeoff from runway 10 at Manaus-Eduardo Gomes International Airport, the crew heard a loud external noise followed by a yaw to the right and then new noise, similar to a tire burst. Speed at the time of the occurrence was just below V1. The crew decided to abort the takeoff by reducing the thrust levers and engaging the spoilers. The aircraft did not have reversers and was partially controlled on the center of the runway with use of pedals and differential brakes. However, the aircraft could not be stopped on the runway and overran by about 400 m. Contributing factors (translated from Portuguese): a) Cockpit coordination - undetermined The diversity of configurations of the company's aircraft was a complicating factor in aircraft operation, and may have contributed to inadequate cockpit coordination at the time of takeoff abortion. b) Pilot unawareness - undetermined As the drag chute was optional equipment, it is possible that the crew has forgotten that the aircraft was equipped with this device. c) Pilot experience - contributed The pilot did not use the parachute by judging their use at low speed would be inefficient, and, as was optional equipment, there was no description of its use in the aircraft manual. d) Maintenance of aircraft - undetermined Tests conducted on wheels identified that the six connecting bolts of the right outer wheel torque with semicubos were approximately 90% lower than foreseen. It is possible that this fact has contributed to the tire deflation.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CENIPA Report number: IG-171/CENIPA/2013 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

One of the six occupants was injured. The flight took off from Helsinki-Vantaa Airport, Finland at 09:46 local time. The flight was uneventful until 10:14 hours, 9.5 nm from Tallinn runway 26. When the power levers were retarded to flight idle the crew noticed engine vibration and smelled a smoke in the cockpit. The engine chip detector indicator in the cockpit was lit. After a short discussion about which engine should be shut down the flight engineer shut down the left engine and the captain tried to start the APU to gain more thrust. During the approach the air traffic controller noticed the aircraft deviating from the approach path to the left and notified the crew. The crew was unable to maintain a proper approach path both in lateral and vertical dimensions. The attempts to start the APU engine failed. Visual contact with the runway was established 0.5 nm from the threshold. The aircraft crossed the airport boundary being not configured for landing and with an indicated airspeed (IAS) of 295-300 km/h. The flaps were extended for 10Â° over the threshold; the landing gear was lowered after passing the runway threshold and retracted again. The aircraft made a high speed low pass over the runway at an altitude of ca 10-15 feet with the landing gear traveling down and up again. Flaps were extended over the runway. At the end of the runway full power on the right engine was selected, and the aircraft climbed 15-20 feet and started turning left. The crew started retracting flaps and lowered the landing gear. The aircraft crossed the highway at the end of the runway at ca 30 feet, then descended again, colliding with treetops at the lake shore and made a crash-landing on the snow and ice-covered lake waterline. Due to the thick ice the aircraft remained on the ice and slid 151 m on the ice with heading 238Â° before coming to a full stop. After the impact the flight engineer shoot down the right engine and power and released all engine fire extinguishers. All persons onboard escaped immediately through the main door. No emergency was declared and despite suggestions from first officer, a go-around was not formally commanded. The airplane gradually sank through the ice after the accident. Causes of the accident: 1. The failure of the left engine lubrication oil system, leading to the failure of the rear compressor bearing and inflight engine failure. 2. The failure of the crew to maintain the approach path and adhere to single engine landing procedures. Factors contributing to the accident: 1. Improper and insufficient crew training, inter alia complete absence of simulator training 2. The lack of effective coordination between crewmembers 3. The failure of the crew to start RU19A-300 (APU) 4. Adverse weather conditions 5. Inadequate company supervision by Polish CAA, consisting in not noticing the lack of flight crew training and companies generally poor safety culture. 6. Inadequate company maintenance practices, leaving preexisting breather duct failure unnoticed.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ESIB Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) jaan@flickr; near Tallinn-Ãlemiste Airport (TLL); 18 March 2010; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane operated Aviastar-TU flight TUP1906 on a ferry service from Hurghada Airport (HRG), Egypt. All eight crew members survived the accident. The flight operated on a passenger service from Moskva-Domodedovo Airport to Hurghada the day before, carrying 210 passengers. Shortly after takeoff at 01:20, the crew noticed a burning smell in the cabin and returned to Domodedovo. An uneventful landing was carried out at 03:08. The problem turned out to be an electric heater that had malfunctioned. The flight continued to Egypt at 13:34 after repairs had been accomplished.  The return flight to Moscow was a ferry flight without passengers or cargo. Three flight crew members, an engineer and four flight attendants were on board when the airplane departed Hurghada at 19:00. On approach to Moscow the flight was cleared for a runway 14L ILS-approach. Weather was reported to the crew as: visibility at the beginning of runway 1300, mid-600, at the end of 550 m, vertical visibility 60 m, wind 170 degrees, at 2 m/sec. The airplane descended until it struck trees, cutting a swath trough the forest. It came to rest 1450 m short of the runway threshold and 150 m further to the right of the runway. Conclusion: Investigators concluded that the flight crew conducted an approach to the airport in below-minima weather conditions for an airplane with a defective flight control computer system. They failed to execute a go-around when failing to obtain visual contact with the ground. Contributing factors were: - Insufficient training of the crew to perform approaches at or near weather minima; - Lack of control over the activities of the crew, which led to poor resource management (CRM) of the captain; - Failure of the flight control computer system, which led to an increase in the allowed weather minima of the aircraft; - Failure of captain to divert to another airport; - Failure of captain to decide about a missed approach when there was visual contact with the approach lights; - Failure of the co-pilot to call for a missed approach; - Unsatisfactory interaction in the crew, resulting in a descent below safe altitude. Failure of the flight control computer system in flight (most likely due to unstable radio altimeters at altitudes exceeding their operating range) and the impossibility of ""removal"" of failure on this plane because of the lack of buttons to simulate the compression of the undercarriage, and inadequate crew training, and possibly fatigue, led to a significant increase of mental and emotional stress in which it it is not possible to make the best decision for the successful completion of the flight.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: MAK Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC)  Federal Agency for Air Transport   Location  Images: photo (c) MAK Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC); near Moskva-Domodedovo Airport (DME/UUDD); 22 March 2010 photo (c) MAK Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC); near Moskva-Domodedovo Airport (DME/UUDD); March 2010 photo (c) MAK Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC); near Moskva-Domodedovo Airport (DME/UUDD); March 2010 photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Moskva-Vnukovo Airport (VKO/UUWW); April 2000 photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Maastricht/Aachen Airport (MST/EHBK); July 1994 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Both pilots were killed.  The EMB-120 prepared to take off from the taxiway E2 intersection of runway 29. The flight was a training flight to revalidate the captain's command instrument rating. The supervisory pilot/training captain advised the aerodrome controller that the departure would incorporate asymmetric flight (a simulated engine failure), and was approved by the controller to perform the manoeuvre. Witnesses reported that the takeoff appeared 'normal' until a few moments after becoming airborne, when the aircraft rolled and diverged left from its takeoff path. They watched as the aircraft continued rolling left, and entered a steep nose-down attitude. The airplane impacted the ground in a right wing-low, nose-down attitude of about 65 degrees. A high intensity, fuel-fed fire that followed the collision with the ground destroyed most of the fuselage and cabin and right wing. CONTRIBUTING SAFETY FACTORS: - The pilot in command initiated a simulated left engine failure just after becoming airborne and at a speed that did not allow adequate margin for error. - The pilot in command simulated a failure of the left engine by selecting flight idle instead of zero thrust, thereby simulating a simultaneous failure of the left engine and its propeller autofeather system, instead of a failure of the engine alone. - The pilot under check operated the aircraft at a speed and attitude (bank angle) that when uncorrected, resulted in a loss of control. - The pilot under check increased his workload by increasing torque on the right engine and selecting the yaw damper. - The pilot in command probably became preoccupied and did not abandon the simulated engine failure after the heading and speed tolerance for the manoeuvre were exceeded and before control of the aircraft was lost.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ATSB Report number: AO-2010-019 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Two pilots killed in Darwin plane crash (Nationwide News, 22-3-2010)  ATSB Report 	AO-2010-019   Location  Images: photo (c) ATSB; Darwin Airport, NT (DRW/YPDN); 22 March 2010 photo (c) ATSB; Darwin Airport, NT (DRW/YPDN); 22 March 2010 photo (c) ATSB; Darwin Airport, NT (DRW/YPDN); 22 March 2010 photo (c) ATSB; Darwin Airport, NT (DRW/YPDN); 22 March 2010 photo (c) ATSB; Darwin Airport, NT (DRW/YPDN); 22 March 2010 photo (c) ATSB; Darwin Airport, NT (DRW/YPDN); 22 March 2010 photo (c) Ramon Vila; Darwin Airport, NT (DRW/YPDN); 01 April 2005 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The owner of Eurofox N829BM, with no intent to fly, placed a wooden chock under one of the main landing gear wheels and removed the upper engine cowl. He attempted to trouble shoot an engine starting problem on the Eurofox aircraft. The Eurofox engine started when his right knee contacted the starter switch as he attempted to enter the unoccupied aircraft. The Eurofox's engine continued to run causing the aircraft to jump the wooden chock and surge forward. The unoccupied aircraft traveled approximately 200 feet until it struck a Learjet 35A, registration N376HA. The Eurofox's right wing forward leading edge and wing tip struck the Learjet empennage tail section. The impact caused both the Learjet and the Eurofox to pivot in clockwise directions. The eurofox rotated to a position which permitted its composite propeller to disintegrate as it contacted the Learjet's left outboard wing, aileron, and fuel tank. The Eurofox's engine ceased operating shortly after contact with the other aircraft.  The Eurofox suffered substantial damage to its entire wing structure, wing struts, propeller, forward fuselage, firewall, and engine compartment.  The Learjet suffered substantial damage to the empennage tail section, wing structure, and fuselage.

An Instrument Landing System approach was carried out and the aircraft touched down on the 6150 foot long runway 06. Following touchdown, the flight crew were unable to stop the aircraft prior to the end of the runway. The aircraft came to rest in deep mud, the nose wheel approximately 340 feet beyond the runway end and 140 feet beyond the edge of the paved runway end strip. A local fire department responded and arrived on-scene approximately 20 minutes after the aircraft departed the runway. The flight crew exited the aircraft using a ladder provided by the fire fighters. There were no injuries and the aircraft had minor damage. FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1. The aircraft touched down between 2000 and 2500 feet from the threshold and at a higher than required airspeed, which significantly increased the required runway length to safely stop the aircraft. 2. The presence of standing water on the runway caused the aircraft to hydroplane, which led to a loss of directional control and braking ability, significantly increasing the required stopping distance. 3. The reduction of reverse thrust following touchdown to realign with the runway centreline, in accordance with the manufacturer's recommended practice, increased the aircraft's required stopping distance. 4. The decision to carry out a pilot-flown-approach, rather than a pilot-monitored-approach, at night, in heavy rain, likely contributed to the aircraft's higher than required airspeed that was maintained until touchdown. 5. The combination of delayed touchdown point, higher than required touchdown speed, and standing water on the runway prevented the aircraft from stopping within the available landing distance. As a result, the aircraft overran the runway, coming to rest in deep mud.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: TSB Report A10A0032 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ  History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  17 April 2018 C-GCJZ Cargojet Airways 0 near Hamilton, ON (CYHM) min Engine failure Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All on board were killed in the accident, including Polish President Lech Kaczynski. The airplane departed Warszawa-Okecie Airport (WAW), Poland at 07:27 local time, carrying Polish President Lech Kaczynski, his wife, several Members of Parliament, President of the National Bank of Poland Slawomir Skrzypek, Chief of General Staff Franciszek Gagor, the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrzej Kremer and a number of passengers and crew members.  During the flight the crew was in contact with air traffic controllers at Minsk, Moscow and Smolensk. The crew also was in contact with the crew of a Polish Air Force Yakovlev 40 passenger plane that had landed at Smolensk Air Base 90 minutes ahead of the Presidential flight. At about 10:14 the flight descended through an altitude of 7500 m. Minsk Control radioed that the visibility at Smolensk Air Base was 400 m due to fog. The same conditions were transmitted to the crew when they contacted the controller at Smolensk. About 10:25 the pilot of the Yak-40 on the ground at Smolensk radioed that horizontal visibility was 400 m and vertical visibility about 50 m. Shortly afterwards they reported that an Ilyushin 76 transport plane had diverted to an alternate airfield after two attempts to land. The crew continued preparations for an approach to runway 26 at the Smolensk Air Base. The cockpit door was open and during the approach there were two passengers present on the flight deck. Meanwhile, visibility worsened to 200 m. This information was transmitted to the crew at 10:37. The crew requested permission to carry out a 'trial' approach to decision height (100 m) and asked the controller to expect a go around. About 18 seconds before impact the terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS) sounded: ""Pull up"", followed by an aural warning: ""TERRAIN AHEAD"". About 5 seconds before impact the autopilot and autothrottle were disconnected in order to execute a go around. The airplane contacted upsloping terrain at a distance of about 1100 meters from the runway and 40 m to the left of extended centreline. The aircraft height at that point was 15 m below the level of the runway threshold. The left wing struck a large tree causing the airplane to roll inverted. The Tu-154 crashed and broke up. The immediate cause of the accident was the failure of the crew to take a timely decision to proceed to an alternate airdrome although they were not once timely informed on the actual weather conditions at Smolensk ""Severny"" Airdrome that were significantly lower than the established airdrome minima; descent without visual contact with ground references to an altitude much lower than minimum descent altitude for go around (100 m) in order to establish visual flight as well as no reaction to the numerous TAWS warnings which led to controlled flight into terrain, aircraft destruction and death of the crew and passengers. According to the conclusion made by the pilot-experts and aviation psychologists, the presence of the Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Air Forces in the cockpit until the collision exposed psychological pressure on the PIC's decision to continue descent in the conditions of unjustified risk with a dominating aim of landing at any means. Contributing factors to the accident were: - long discussion of the Tu-154M crew with the Protocol Director and crew of the Polish Yak-40 concerning the information on the actual weather that was lower than the established minima and impossibility (according to the Tu-154M crew opinion) to land at the destination airdrome which increased the psychological stress of the crew and made the PIC experience psychological clash of motives: on the one hand he realized that landing in such conditions was unsafe, on the other hand he faced strong motivation to land exactly at the destination airdrome. In case of proceeding to an alternate airdrome the PIC expected negative reaction from the Main Passenger; - lack of compliance to the SOP and lack of CRM in the crew; - a significant break in flights in complicated weather conditions (corresponding to his weather minima 60x800) that the PIC had had as well as his low experience in conducting non-precision approach; - early transition by the navigator to the altitude callouts on the basis of the radio altimeter indications without considering the uneven terrain; - conducting flight with engaged autopilot and autothrottle down to altitudes much lower than the minimum descent altitude which does not comply with the FCOM provisions; - late start of final descent which resulted in increased vertical speed of descent the crew had to maintain. The systematic causes of the accident involving the Tu-154M tail number 101 aircraft of the Republic of Poland were significant shortcomings in the organization of flight operations, flight crew preparation and arrangement of the VIP flight in the special air regiment. In a separate investigation , the Polish Committee for Investigation of National Aviation Accidents concluded the following: Cause of Accident: The immediate cause of the accident was the descent below the minimum descent altitude at an excessive rate of descent in weather conditions which prevented visual contact with the ground, as well as a delayed execution of the go-around procedure. Those circumstances led to an impact on a terrain obstacle resulting in separation of a part of the left wing with aileron and consequently to the loss of aircraft control and eventual ground impact.  Circumstances Contributing to the Accident: 1) Failure to monitor altitude by means of a pressure altimeter during a non-precision approach;  2) failure by the crew to respond to the PULL UP warning generated by the TAWS;  3) attempt to execute the go-around maneuver under the control of ABSU (automatic go around);  4) Approach Control confirming to the crew the correct position of the airplane in relation to the RWY threshold, glide slope, and course which might have affirmed the crew's belief that the approach was proceeding correctly although the airplane was actually outside the permissible deviation margin;  5) failure by LZC to inform the crew about descending below the glide slope and delayed issuance of the level-out command;  6) incorrect training of the Tu-154M flight crews in the 36 Regiment.

The sky conditions were clear and the winds were estimated to be 5 to 8 knots. The takeoff was initiated on a slight downhill slope, into approximately 70 degrees of crosswind, with a minimum of 2000 feet available to a predetermined reject point. All engine parameters were normal; however, the aircraft did not accelerate as expected and the takeoff continued approximately 800 feet past the reject point, to an area where the terrain sloped more steeply into a depression. The aircraft became airborne at low speed over the depression and maximum power was applied in order to clear gently rising terrain ahead. The main gear contacted the ground on the far side of the depression, and the aircraft bounced and touched down a second time in an area covered by basketball size rocks. At that point the takeoff was rejected and the aircraft came to a stop approximately 300 feet past the second touchdown point.

The crew had carried out the sector from Hong Kong to Surabaya on the previous day. The accident aircraft stayed overnight at Surabaya Airport and was parked at Stand 8. The accident aircraft uplifted 24,400 kilogram (kg) of fuel and was prepared for departure. The flight was airborne at 08:24 local time. During the climb, the flight crew noticed some abnormal Engine Pressure Ratio (EPR) fluctuations on No. 2 engine, with a range of approximately Â± 0.015 around EPR target. No. 1 engine also had abnormal EPR fluctuations but within a narrower range. At 08:58, shortly after levelling off at FL390, an ECAM message ""ENG 2 CTL SYS FAULT"" was annunciated. ECAM information ""ENG 2 SLOW RESPONSE"" was shown for crew awareness. After consulting with a maintenance engineer, it was decided to continue since all engine parameters were considered normal other than the EPR fluctuations. Almost two hours into the flight, the same ECAM message appeared, with an additional information message ""AVOID RAPID THR CHANGES"". The engine anti-ice was selected on for both engines, but this had not effect. The crew then again contacted a maintenance engineer, who told them that he had seen these EPR fluctuations before and that the Fuel Metering Unit (FMU) of engine no. 2 would be replaced after landing. Nearing the destination, the crew began to prepare for a runway 07L arrival. According to recent weather information, significant windshear was forecast for both runway 07L and 07R. At 13:19 hrs local time during the descent to a cleared level of FL230, ECAM messages ""ENG 1 CTL SYS FAULT"" and ""ENG 2 STALL"" were annunciated within a short period of time. According to the Commander, a light ""pop"" sound was heard and some ""ozone"" and ""burning"" smell was detected shortly before the ECAM message ""ENG 2 STALL"". At that time the flight was at about 110 nautical miles southeast of Hong Kong, and was descending through FL300 with a Calibrated Air Speed (CAS) of 295 kt. Vertical mode ""Open Descent"" was selected. The flight crew completed the necessary ECAM actions and set No. 2 thrust lever accordingly to IDLE position. ECAM information ""ENG 1 SLOW RESPONSE"" and ""AVOID RAPID THRUST CHANGES"" were also annunciated. No. 1 thrust lever was advanced to Maximum Continuous Thrust (MCT) position as per the ""SINGLE ENGINE OPERATIONS"" strategy stated in the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH). However No. 1 engine N1 only temporary increased to about 57% N1 and then dropped back to about 37% N1 at 13:21 hrs. At 13:21 hrs, the flight crew declared ""PAN PAN"" to Hong Kong Radar and advised that No. 2 engine was operating at idle thrust. The crew made the request to shorten the track for a priority landing. Hong Kong Radar then cleared the flight to proceed directly to waypoint ""LIMES"".  At about 13:26 hrs, the Commander took control of the aircraft as the PF in accordance with Cathay standard operating procedures for one engine inoperative and the co-pilot became the Pilot Monitoring. At 13:30 hrs, when the aircraft was approximately 45 nm southeast from Hong Kong and was about to level off at 8,000 ft AMSL, ECAM message ""ENG 1 STALL"" was annunciated. The CAS at that moment was about 295 kt. ECAM actions were carried out by the flight crew and No. 1 thrust lever was put to IDLE position accordingly. Autothrust (A/THR) was disengaged and both engine master switches remained at the ""ON"" position. With both thrust levers at IDLE position, the Commander then tested the controllability of the engines by moving the thrust levers one at a time. There were no thrust changes corresponding to the engine lever movements initially. At 13:32 hrs, ECAM messages ""ENG 1 STALL"" was annunciated again. At 13:32 hrs, the crew declared ""MAYDAY"" and advised Hong Kong Approach of the double engine stall situation. CPA780 was then cleared to descend to 3,000 ft AMSL. At that time, the aircraft was still in Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) and the CAS was at about 233 kt and reducing. At around the same time, the Commander disconnected the Autopilot and the Flight Directors (FD) and flew the aircraft manually. The altitude increased from 6,760 ft to 7,164 ft AMSL with the CAS reducing and the aircraft started to descend again when the CAS decreased to about 200 kt.  When the aircraft was on base leg during the approach, the flight crew reported that they were flying in VMC. The crew moved the thrust levers to check the engine control but there was no direct response from the engines. The No. 1 engine speed eventually increased to about 74% N1 with the No. 1 thrust lever in the CLB (climb) detent position. The No. 2 engine speed remained at sub-idle about 17% N1, with the No. 2 thrust lever at the IDLE position.  At 13:37 hrs, the ATC made both runways 07L and 07R available for CPA780. During the descent and approach, there were a number of other ECAM warning messages announced in the cockpit which were not relevant to the engine control problem.  The flight crew carried out the ""ENG ALL ENG FLAMEOUT - FUEL REMAINING"" checklist in the QRH for No. 2 engine in an attempt to clear the thrust control fault of that engine. As per the checklist, the Ram Air Turbine (RAT) was deployed manually, APU bleed was selected ""ON"" and No. 2 engine MASTER switch was set to ""OFF"" then ""ON"" at 13:38 hrs. However, No. 2 engine remained at a sub-idle speed of 17% N1. At 13:38 hrs, Flap CONF 1 was selected. At 13:39 hrs, when CPA780 was at 5,524 ft AMSL, a CAS at 219 kt and a distance of nine nm from the airport, the Commander tried to decrease the speed by retarding the No. 1 thrust lever. However, there was no corresponding decrease in No. 1 engine speed. Eventually, No. 1 thrust lever was left at the IDLE position and No. 1 engine speed remained at 74% N1. At 13:40 hrs, Hong Kong Approach cleared CPA780 for a visual approach for Runway 07L. Flight crew deployed the speedbrakes when the aircraft was at 5,216 ft AMSL descending with a CAS of 234 kt at around 8 nm from the runway. Flight crew selected landing gear down shortly afterwards. The Commander aimed to fly the aircraft at a CAS as close as possible to the Minimum Selectable Speed (VLS), which was 158 kt at that time. The aircraft went through the runway extended centreline and recaptured the centreline from the north in order to manage altitude and airspeed.  At around 13:41 hrs, with the Maximum Allowable Speed (Vmax) at 240 kt and actual CAS at 244 kt, an overspeed warning was generated by the onboard system. A short while later Hong Kong Approach cleared CPA780 to land on runway 07L and advised that the current surface wind was 150 degrees at 13 kt. Flight crew stowed the speedbrakes when the aircraft was at 984 ft AMSL and armed the ground spoilers at 816 ft AMSL. At 13:42 hrs, when CPA780 was still at flap CONF 1, with a CAS of 227 kt and a vertical speed of 1,216 ft per min at an altitude of 732 ft AMSL and at about two nm to touchdown, the warning ""Too Low Terrain"" was generated by the Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS). Flap CONF 2 was selected at around one nm to touchdown with a CAS of 234 kt and at an altitude of 548 ft AMSL. A flashing ""F RELIEF"" message was displayed at Engine Warning Display (EWD) as the TE flap was extended to 8-degree position instead of the commanded 14-degree position. With a Vmax of 205 kt, another overspeed warning was generated shortly after Flap 2 selection. The ""Too Low Terrain"" warning changed to ""Pull Up"" warning briefly at 176 ft AMSL and back to ""Too Low Terrain"" within a very short timeframe. The EGPWS warning stopped at 24 ft above the ground. During the final approach, No. 1 engine speed decreased to about 70% N1 at touchdown, with the No. 1 thrust lever at IDLE position. No. 2 engine speed remained at about 17% N1 throughout the final approach and landing. CPA780 touched down on runway 07L at 13:43 hrs at a position between abeam Taxiways A4 and A5 and with a distance of around 680 metres (m) from the beginning of the runway threshold at a ground speed of 231 kt. The landing weight was approximately 173,600 kg. The landing wind was 143 degrees at 14 kt. Immediately after both main gears touched down on the runway, the right main gear bounced and the aircraft became airborne again briefly. The aircraft then rolled left seven degrees and pitched down to -2.5 degrees at the second touchdown during which, the lower cowling of No. 1 engine contacted the runway surface. Spoilers deployed automatically. Both engine thrust reversers were selected by the Commander. Only No. 1 engine thrust reverser was deployed successfully and ECAM message ""ENG 2 REV FAULT"" was annunciated. Maximum manual braking was applied. As required by the company procedure for the purpose of drawing the PFÂs attention in the status of the deceleration devices, the co-pilot called out ""no spoilers, no REV green, no DECEL"" during the landing roll. The aircraft came to a complete stop on the runway at a position just passed Taxiway A10, with its nose wheel at about 309 m from the end of Runway 07L. The total distance for stopping the aircraft from the initial touchdown was approximately 2,630 m. The crew shut down the engines and requested the tower controller to check for a possible wheel fire. There was no sign of fire. An emergency evacuation was then ordered just after 13:45. One passenger sustained serious injuries in the evacuation while 56 passengers and six crew members sustained minor injuries. Causes: The accident was caused by fuel contamination. The contaminated fuel, which contained SAP spheres, uplifted at WARR subsequently caused the loss of thrust control on both engines of the aircraft during approach to VHHH. The following chain of events and circumstances had led to the uplift of contaminated fuel to CPA780: i. The re-commissioning of the hydrant refuelling system after the hydrant extension work in WARR had not completely removed all contaminants in the affected hydrant refuelling circuit. Salt water remained in the affected hydrant refuelling circuit.  ii. The re-commissioning of the hydrant refuelling system after the hydrant extension work in WARR was not properly coordinated which led to the premature resumption of the hydrant refuelling operations while the hydrant system still contained contaminant.  iii. The refuelling operation in WARR, in particular low flow-rate refuelling, DP recording and monitoring, did not fully comply with the international fuel industry latest guidance. iv. A number of unscheduled filter monitors replacements after the premature resumption of hydrant refuelling operation were not investigated by the fuel supplier and hydrant operator at WARR.  v. The unusual vibration observed during the refuelling of CPA780 was not stopped immediately and properly investigated by the fuel supplier personnel.  The investigation also identified the following deficiencies and contributing factors that may cause possible fuel contamination:  i. There were no established international civil aviation requirements for oversight and quality control on aviation fuel supply at airports.  ii. There were no established international civil aviation requirements for refuel operational procedures and associated training for aviation fuel supply personnel. iii. The manual monitoring of DP changes in a fuelling dispenser during refuelling was not effective.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CAD Hong Kong Report number: 2/2013 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  8 September 2016 B-HLL Cathay Dragon 0 Hong Kong-Chek Lap Kok International Airport (HKG/VHHH) min Collision with Ground support equipment Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All 103 passengers and seven crew members survived but ten sustained serious injuries. Merpati Flight MNA836 operated on a scheduled flight from Sorong-Dominique Edward Osok Airport (SOQ/WAXX). Departure was delayed for almost three hours due to heavy rain over Manokwari. The flight was planned under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR). The destination, Manokwari, had no published instrument approach procedure. Terminal area operations, including approach and landing, were required to be conducted under the Visual Flight Rules (VFR). At 10:46 the crew made the first direct contact with Rendani Radio and reported their position as 14 Nm from Manokwari, and maintaining altitude 10,500 feet. Following this radio contact, Rendani Radio informed the crew that the weather was continuous slight rain, visibility 3 kilometers, cloud overcast with cumulus-stratocumulus at 1,400 feet, temperature 24 degrees Celsius, QNH 1012 hectopascals. The controller then instructed the crew to descend and joint right downwind for runway 35, and to report when overhead the airport. Shortly after, the crew reported overhead the airport at 5,000 feet. The controller then instructed the crew to report when they were on final approach for runway 35. The crew acknowledged this instruction. At 10:54 the crew reported that they were on final for runway 35. The controller informed them that the wind was calm, runway condition was wet and clear. The crew read back the wind condition and that the runway was clear, but did not mention the wet runway condition. The aircraft was observed to make a normal touchdown on the runway, about 120 meters from the approach end of runway 35. Witnesses on the ground and on board reported that engine reverser sound was not heard during landing roll.  During the landing roll, the aircraft veered to the left about 140 meters from the end of runway 35, then overran the departure end of runway 35. It came to a stop 205 meters beyond the end of the runway in a narrow river; the Rendani River. The airport rescue and fire fighting unit was immediately deployed to assist the post-crash evacuation. Due to the steep terrain 155 meters from the end of runway 35, the rescuers had to turn back and use the airportÂs main road to reach the aircraft. The accident site was in an area of shallow muddy water surrounded by mangrove vegetation.

During the return flight to Exeter the right engine suffered a significant oil leak and lost oil pressure, so the flight crew shut it down. Subsequently, the crew noticed the left engine also leaking oil, with a fluctuating oil pressure, so they initiated a diversion to Bristol, where they landed safely. The oil leaks were traced to damaged O-ring seals within the oil cooler fittings on both engines. Both oil coolers had been removed and refitted during the base maintenance check at Exeter. It was probably during re-installation that the O-ring seals were damaged. A number of factors led to this damage and to missed oil leak checks.Sources: https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/384823/AAIB_Bulletin_6-2011.pdf History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  8 January 1993 N826MA Mesaba Aviation, Inc. 0 Detroit, MI non Images: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates24-Nov-2016 19:32 harro Added Corrections or additions? ...

A little later, during final approach, the aural warning for non-extension of landing gear sounded. The crew decided to continue the approach. On landing, the airplane exited the runway to the right and came to a stop leaning on the fuselage. Examination of the airplane showed that the landing gear was retracted with the landing gear doors open. The landing on the fuselage resulted from an incomplete analysis by the crew of the consequences of the electrical failure and the warning that triggered during the final approach. The airplane operated on a repositioning flight from New Caledonia to Wallis Island via Nadi, Fiji, in preparation for medevac flight. Causes of the Accident: At night in adverse meteorological conditions, the crew decided to continue with the approach and to land, while the landing gear was not locked in the down position due to the failure of the secondary electric circuit. The origin of this failure was probably the increase in the number of operating cycles of the hydraulic power pack which delivers the hydraulic energy required to extend and retract the landing gear. This led to the failure of the diodes in the protective secondary circuit, which could not be checked in flight.  The decision to continue the approach resulted from incorrect comprehension of the electrical failure and the aural warning that sounded during the final approach. The conviction that the landing gear was locked down, associated with the meteorological conditions and the failure of the circuit-breakers to trip, did not prompt the crew to correctly assess the risk associated with the electrical failure.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Report number: f-an100424 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 years and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Fiji Times   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Additionally, the crew used  faulty techniques for landing on short and wet runways. Contributing to the accident was the lack of planning to carry out and complete the published instrument approach procedure for runway 20 and the deviation from standard operating procedures of the company.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Aerocivil Report number: COL-10-11-GIA Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Aviacol   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

CONCLUSION (translated from Russian): The accident of airplane AN-2 RA-40373 was the result of the nose striking the ground during the execution of a forced landing due to shutdown of the ASz-62IR engine while in the process of taking off, most likely due to ingress of water into the carburetor from the fuel system of the aircraft, which led to the shutdown of the engine. The cause of the accident was a combination of the following factors: - failure to comply with guidelines in part: checking facility for storing and dispensing aviation fuels and lubricants, monitoring and verification of the fuel sludge discharge after refueling for the lack of water and solids; - execution of a forced landing straight ahead outside the landing area on difficult terrain, covered with forests, a rugged ravine and a creek.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) MAK; Goryachy Klyuch; May 2010 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Tambo International Airport (JNB/FAOR)","Tripoli International Airport (TIP/HLLT)","Accident investigation report completed and information captured","Afriqiyah Airways flight 771, an Airbus A330-202, crashed on approach to Tripoli International Airport, Libya. There were 11 crew members and 93 passengers on board. One passenger survived the accident. On May 11, 2010 at 19:45 UTC, the aircraft departed Johannesburg-O.R. Tambo International Airport (JNB), South Africa on an international passenger flight to Tripoli. The co-pilot was pilot flying. The en route part of the flight was uneventful.  The captain contacted the Tripoli ACC controller at 05:29 local time (02:29 UTC) and received clearance direct to Tripoli for a TW locator approach to runway 09. Weather was reported as: wind calm, visibility 6 km, clear sky, temperature/dew point 19/17Â°C, QNH 1008. After receiving further descent clearances, the crew contacted the Tripoli Tower controller at 05:58. Tripoli Tower cleared the aircraft to continue the approach and to report runway in sight. The flight then received information from a flight that had landed ahead of them, informing the accident crew about fog patches noticed during short final. At 06:00 the flight passed the TW locator beacon at an altitude of 1000 feet, 200 ft below the prescribed altitude. The captain then informed ATC that he would report when runway in sight. The approach was continued below the Minimum Descent Altitude of 620 feet but the crew still did not have the runway in sight. At an altitude of 280 feet the GPWS sounded ('too low terrain'). The captain then instructed the co-pilot to execute a go-around, after which he informed the Tower controller. The aircraft began to climb, reaching an altitude of 450 feet above ground level. The Airbus then nosed down, causing the captain to take priority over the flight controls by pushing on priority button and the aircraft was fully under the captain's control who applied a sharp nose down input. The captain did not verbally state that he was taking control. He applied a pitch-up and a pitch-down input on his stick until the airplane impacted the ground 1200 m from the threshold of runway 09 with high energy (-4400 ft/min) and high longitudinal velocity (260 kts). The aircraft broke up, leaving an 800 m long wreckage trail. PROBABLE CAUSE: A final approach carried out in common managed guidance mode should have relieved the crew of their tasks. The limited coordination and cooperation between the two crew members, especially the change into vertical selected guidance mode by the PF, probably led to a lack of a common action plan. The lack of feedback from the 28 April 2010 flight, flown by the same crew on the same aircraft, did not allow them to anticipate the potential risks associated with managing non-precision approaches. The pilots'  performance was likely impaired because of fatigue, but the extent of their impairment and the degree to which it contributed to the performance deficiencies that occurred during the flight cannot be conclusively determined. During the go-around, the crew was surprised not to acquire visual references. On one hand the crew feared exceeding the aircraftÂs speed limits in relation to its configuration, and on the other hand they were feeling the effects of somatogravic illusion due to the aircraft acceleration. This probably explains the aircraft handling inputs, mainly nose-down inputs, applied during the go-around. These inputs were not consistent with what is expected in this flight phase. The degraded CRM did not make it possible for either crew member to identify and recover from the situation before the collision with the ground, even when the TAWS warnings were activated close to the ground. Based on elements from the investigation, the accident resulted from: - The lack of common action plan during the approach and a final approach continued below the MDA, without ground visual reference acquired. - The inappropriate application of flight control inputs during a go- around and on the activation of TAWS warnings, - The lack of monitoring and controlling of the flight path. These events can be explained by the following factors: - Limited CRM on approach that degraded during the missed approach. This degradation was probably amplified by numerous radio-communications during the final approach and the crewÂs state of fatigue, - Aircraft control inputs typical in the occurrence of somatogravic perceptual illusions, - Inappropriate systematic analysis of flight data and feedback mechanism within the AFRIQIYAH Airways. - Non adherence to the company operation manual, SOP and standard terminology. In addition, the investigation committee found the following as contributing factors to the accident: - Weather available to the crew did not reflect the actual weather situation in the final approach segment at Tripoli International Airport. - In adequacy of training received by the crew. - Occupancy of tower frequency by both air and ground movements control.METAR: 03:50 UTC / 05:20 local time: HLLT 120350Z VRB01KT 6000 NSC 19/17 Q1008=03:50 UTC; Winds variable at 1 knot; visibility 6000 m; Temperature 19Â°C; Dew point 17Â°C; Ceiling unlimited; 1008 hPa04:20 UTC / 06:20 local time: HLLT 120420Z 27007KT 5000 BR NSC 19/17 Q1009=04:20 UTC; Winds 270 degrees at 7 knots; visibility 5000 m; Temperature 19Â°C; Dew point 17Â°C; Ceiling unlimited; 1009 hPaAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: CAA Libya Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   Afriqiyah statement   Location  Images: photo (c) Dutch Safety Board; Tripoli International Airport (TIP/HLLT); May 2010 photo (c) Google; Tripoli International Airport (TIP/HLLT); 13 May 2010 photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG/LFPG); October 2009 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Normally an aural and visual warning system activates when the wheels are still out when the airspeed drops below 70 mph. In this case the approach speed for the landing was 85 mph because of the wind conditions, so the system did not activate. Furthermore, the pilot's attention was focused on the unexplained presence of floating foam near the landing zone.

The cargo flight originated from Rio de Janeiro-GaleÃ£o-Antonio Carlos Jobim International Airport (BGL), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  According to the operator, the flight crew heard and felt a large impact after 30 degree flaps was selected during the approach.  Postflight inspection revealed that approximately twelve feet of the right wing inboard fore flap was missing and had caused substantial damage to the aft fuselage. The separated section of the fore flap was recovered and examined. The examination revealed that a large portion of the enamel was missing from the fore flap attachment fitting of the carriage assembly and that there was a large amount of contamination and grease buildup around the lubrication fitting. Extensive corrosion byproducts covered up the lubrication passage in the attachment, which prevented passage of grease to the bearing, causing extensive corrosion in the bore and propagated by fatigue before final ductile separation.

Both pilots escaped unhurt. The airplane operated on a cargo flight from Sorocaba Airport to Cascavel. Weather at the destination was poor with limited visibility in fog and a 100 ft overcast. The crew attempted to land, but touched down in a soy bean field about 700 m from the runway 33 threshold. The airplane traveled about 150 meters before coming to rest on its belly. The only navigational aid available at Cascavel is NDB. Contributing Factors 1 Human Factor 1.1 Medical Aspect a) Fatigue - undetermined It is probable that fatigue occurred, considering that the day before the accident, the crew performed a journey longer than 24 hours, which would be 16 hours, taking into account the type of crew, as well as the rest time. b) Visual illusions - contributed It is possible that the crew landed before the runway due to false sensory impressions generated by the dark environment surrounding the aerodrome and the low visibility conditions at the time of the accident (black hole effect). 1.2 Psychological Aspect 1.2.1 Individual Information a) Attitude - contributed Excessive self-confidence in equipment and mission influenced the takeoff of Sorocaba in weather conditions unfavorable to landing in Cascavel. b) Motivation - contributed The pilot demonstrated to be adapted to the work environment and the flight routine, however he showed a high motivation to fulfill the mission as it was programmed, in order to cause the minimum of interference in the aerial programming of the company. (c) Decision-making - contributed The pilots operated at night, a condition that in itself modifies visual perception, although the pilot in command was adapted to routine and recognized that their cognitive abilities could be diminished. In addition, the flight was accompanied by difficulties, such as adverse weather conditions, making it difficult to see and to process information. These conditions added to the stress of the situation compromised the judgment and the decision. 1.2.2 Psychosocial Information a) Team dynamics - contributed The aircraft commander did not request the support of the co-pilot to carry out the descent procedure, took over the operation and intended to make the landing, despite the weather. The co-pilot, being inexperienced, trusted the commander and did not interfere, despite realizing the dangerous conditions. 1.2.3 Organizational Information a) Physical conditions of work - indeterminate Work shifts that generate changes in routines very often require the need for constant physiological adaptations. This condition can lead to the development of fatigue, creating favorable conditions for human error. b) Organizational culture - contributed Flexibility is observed with respect to compliance with flight rules, with low levels of knowledge and application of flight safety strategies. The company was compliant with the changes in operating procedures. c) Training, Training and Training - contributed There was a fragile process of training and qualification of new pilots, with deficient monitoring of personnel and the use of missions to train the crew. d) Organization of work - indeterminate The aerial activity of the company consisted in the service to fixed clients, being important the conservation of the routines of work, to well serve the users. This caused that changes in the meteorological conditions generated much disorder, since the routes had to be altered, generating costs and time. The crew, on the other hand, probably tried to minimize the interpretation of the adversities in order to force the execution of the planned activity. e) Organizational processes - undetermined There may have been a lack of continuous supervision of the aerial activity of the different flights underway. 1.3 Operational Aspect 1.3.1 Concerning the operation of the aircraft a) Coordination of cabin - contributed It became evident that communication between the crew was compromised by inadequate management of the tasks assigned to each one, probably due to the difference between the high experience of the pilot in command and the lack of experience of the co-pilot. b) Flight Discipline - contributed The crew intentionally violated operational rules, regulations and air traffic regulations without any justification for doing so. c) Influence of the environment - undetermined The region near the threshold of runway 33 had visibility-limiting environmental conditions, as it was an area of low demographic density, almost unlMETAR: 08:00 UTC / 05:00 local time: SBCA 190800Z 33015KT 1200 -DZ BR PRFG OVC001 08/08 Q1014=Wind 330 degrees at 15 knots; visibility 1200m; light drizzle, mist, partial fog; overcast at 100 ft; temperature 8Â°C, dew point 8Â°C; 1014 hPa09:00 UTC / 06:00 local time: SBCA 190900Z 32012KT 2000 -DZ BR PRFG OVC001 08/08 Q1014=Wind 320 degrees at 12 knots; visibility 2000m; light drizzle, mist, partial fog; overcast at 100 ft; temperature 8Â°C, dew point 8Â°C; 1014 hPaAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: CENIPA Report number: A - 034/CENIPA/2012 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: AviÃ£o tenta pousar em aeroporto fechado e acaba em fazenda em Cascavel (PR) (Folha Online)  Edson Dantas   Location  Images: photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Rio de Janeiro-Santos Dumont Airport, RJ (SDU/SBRJ); January 1979 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

It struck concrete blocks, runway lights and then bounced. It impacted the runway nose-first. The captain ordered the props to be unlocked so they would go into ground fine pitch. However, the throttle of engine no. 4 was still at 42% with the other engines below 20%. An asymmetric thrust condition occurred as the no. 4 engine consequently did not go into ground fine pitch. This caused the plane to drift to the left side. It passed over a gravel road, then lost the left main landing gear, turned to left and broke the right hand main landing gear and nose gear before it stopped.

The wreckage came to rest on the west bank of the Des Plaines River, in a forest preserve south of the airport. Both pilots were killed in the accident. The flight departed Pontiac-Oakland County International Airport, MI (PTK) at 13:35 and was scheduled to pickup cargo at Chicago-Executive Airport, IL (PWK). During the descent and 14 minutes before the accident, the airplane encountered a layer of moderate rime ice. The captain, who was the pilot flying, and the first officer, who was the monitoring pilot, made multiple statements which were consistent with their awareness and presence of airframe icing. After obtaining visual flight rules conditions, the flight crew cancelled the instrument flight rules clearance and continued with a right, circling approach to runway 34. While turning into the base leg of the traffic pattern, and 45 seconds prior to the accident, the captain called for full flaps and the engine power levers were adjusted several times between 50 and 95 percent. In addition, the captain inquired about the autopilot and fuel balance. In response, the first officer stated that he did not think that the spoilerons were working. Shortly thereafter, the first officer gave the command to add full engine power and the airplane impacted terrain. There was no evidence of flight crew impairment or fatigue in the final 30 minutes of the flight. The cockpit voice recorder showed multiple instances during the flight in which the airplane was below 10,000 feet mean sea level that the crew was engaged in discussions that were not consistent with a sterile cockpit environment, for example a lengthy discussion about Class B airspeeds, which may have led to a relaxed and casual cockpit atmosphere. In addition, the flight crew appears to have conducted checklists in a generally informal manner. As the flight was conducted by a Part 135 operator, it would be expected that both pilots were versed with the importance of sterile cockpit rules and the importance of adhering to procedures, including demonstrating checklist discipline. For approximately the last 24 seconds of flight, both pilots were likely focusing their attention on activities to identify and understand the reason for the airplane's roll handling difficulties, as noted by the captain's comment related to the fuel balance. These events, culminating in the first officer's urgent command to add full power, suggested that neither pilot detected the airplane's decaying energy state before it reached a critical level for the conditions it encountered.

The pilot diverted to the nearest airstrip, which was Beagle Bay, WA. The pilot shut the engine down when the low oil pressure warning light illuminated and conducted a landing at Beagle Bay airstrip. The aircraft overran the airstrip, coming to rest upside down after impacting a mound of dirt. The aircraft was seriously damaged. The pilot, who was the only occupant, sustained minor injuries. From the evidence available it was evident that the engine had a substantial in-flight oil leak, which necessitated the in-flight shut down of the engine and a diversion to the nearest available airstrip.  The accident damage to the engine in the area of the apparent oil leak precluded a conclusive finding as to the source of the leak. Although the detailed examination of the oil tube attachment lug fracture surfaces was inconclusive, the oil tube remained the most likely source of the oil leak. Evidence from other oil tube failures indicated that significant vibratory loading can cause the oil tube attachment lugs to fracture in the manner observed in the oil tube fitted to VH-NTQ. There was no evidence that the transfer tube was subjected to vibration from a compressor turbine or power turbine blade failure or  of an incorrectly fitted engine mount. There was also no evidence of a pre-accident defect that would have caused a reduction in actual engine torque.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ATSB Report number: AO-2010-003 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: ATSB AO-2010-003   Location  Images: photo (c) Western Australia Police; Beagle Bay Airport, WA (BEE); January 2010 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Bud Day Field (SUX), Iowa. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The pilot, copilot, and two passengers were uninjured. The pilot filed an instrument-flight-rules (IFR) flight plan with the destination and alternate airports, both of which were below weather minimums. The pilot and copilot departed from Des Moines Airport in weather minimums that were below the approach minimums for the departure airport. While en route, the destination airport's automated observing system continued to report weather below approach minimums, but the flight crew continued the flight. The flight crew then requested and were cleared for the instrument landing system (ILS) 31 approach and while on that approach were issued visibilities of 1,800 feet runway visual range after changing to tower frequency. During landing, the copilot told the pilot that he was not lined up with the runway. The pilot reportedly said, ""those are edge lights,"" and then realized that he was not properly lined up with the runway. The airplane then touched down beyond a normal touchdown point, about 2,800 feet down the runway, and off the left side of the runway surface. The airplane veered to the left, collapsing the nose landing gear.  The company's procedures did not allow flight crew to depart to an airport that was below minimums but did allow for the flight crew, at their discretion, to perform a ""look-see"" approach to approach minimums if the weather was below minimums. The allowance of a ""look see"" approach essentially negates the procedural risk mitigation afforded by requiring approaches to be conducted only when weather was above approach minimums. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The flight crew's decision to attempt a flight that was below takeoff, landing, and alternate airport weather minimums, which led to a touchdown off the runway surface by the pilot-in-command.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN10LA105 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Sioux Gateway Airport, IA (SUX); 19 January 2010; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Sioux Gateway Airport, IA (SUX); 19 January 2010; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Sioux Gateway Airport, IA (SUX); January 2010; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Sioux Gateway Airport, IA (SUX); January 2010; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft's actual departure time in Barcelona was 11:13 local time. At 12:40, flight CLX 793 contacted Luxembourg Approach (APP) for the first time and was advised by the approach controller that Low Visibility Procedures (LVP) were in operation.  Fog prevailed at Luxembourg airport with a cloud base at 100 feet overcast and a visibility of 100 meters, temperature and dew point were at 1Â°C.  The aircraft was cleared for an ILS approach on runway 24 at 12:49. RVR readings were 350/275/375 meters. At 12:50:55, CLX 793 reported established on the localiser for runway 24 and was transferred to Tower. RVR readings had decreased to 350/250/350 meters.  CLX 793 contacted Luxembourg Tower (TWR) at 12:51:40 and reported established on the ILS 24. The Tower Controller then cleared them to land.  At 12:53:46, reaching decision height at 17 ft, the Pilot Flying called out 'landingÂ. During the flare, the airplane impacted a maintenance van 'ELE 23' positioned slightly to the right of the centreline of runway 24 and about 340 meters from the threshold, with the front-end pointing into the opposite direction (060Â°). The roofline of the van was at a height of 2.54 m (8 ft). The right hand body landing gear of the Boeing 747-400F impacted the roof of ELE 23 with tire no. 12 slightly below the roofline of the van on a backward sloped roof section and rolled over it, damaging the roof on the whole length of the vehicle. The van's lightbar, as well as its R/T antennas, were ripped off on impact. The maintenance crew working on the centreline lights outside of ELE 23 ran off the side of the runway as soon as they noticed an increasing noise from a landing aircraft.  The aircraft landed safely at 12:53:51.  After touchdown, at 12:53:59, the Pilot Flying mentioned to the Pilot Monitoring (PM) that there was a car in the touchdown zone. The PM, monitoring the instruments during landing in accordance  with company procedures, didn't notice it.  The aircraft vacated runway 24 at taxiway Echo and at 12:56:28, while taxiing to apron P7, the PF informed the Tower controller about a car in the touchdown zone. The controller asked if there was a problem and the PF denied. The aircraft continued to the parking position on apron P7 without further incident. Causal and contributory factors:  - The impaired operational readiness of the ELE department due to a manning shortcoming, combined with the lack of provisions to appoint external workforce if necessary, prevented ANA to schedule preventive maintenance work outside of normal operating hours (i.e. during the curfew);  - The decision to carry out preventive maintenance work in low visibility conditions without hampering air traffic gave priority to flight operations over safety aspects;  - The lack of adequate co-ordination between aerodrome control tower and ELE department with regard to the preventive maintenance work contributed to a reduced situational and organizational awareness of the TWR control staff;  - Inadequate procedures for the access of vehicles to the RWY and ILS sensitive area during LVP contributed to the development of an unsafe condition;  - Read-back procedures were not adequately applied by aerodrome control tower on ground control frequency, making this procedural safety net ineffective;  - Low visibility weather conditions, associated with the lack of supplementary ground traffic control and surveillance equipment, limited the capability of aerodrome control tower to identify and correct a developing unsafe condition;  - The use of different frequencies for air traffic and ground traffic on the manoeuvring area reduced the situational awareness of ELE 23 maintenance crew working on the RWY, preventing them to take avoiding action.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ATI Report number: AET-2012/AC-01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  14 May 2023 LX-OCV Cargolux 0 Luxembourg-Findel Airport (LUX) sub Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The captain throttled back the engine, but the aircraft was not able to maintain altitude. The crew attempted to locate their destination airport but were unable. A forced landing was carried out 4 km from the airport. Contributing Factors: 1 Human Factor 1.1 Medical Aspect Not contributing. 1.2 Psychological Aspect 1.2.1 Individual Information A) Attitude - contributed There was disregard for the procedures, since the pilots did not use the checklist for the emergency situation. 1.2.2 Psychosocial Information A) Culture of the working group - undetermined It is possible that the informal rules, shared by some pilots, regarding the use of the checklist, have influenced the behavior of the pilot to decline its use. 1.2.3 Organizational Information A) Organizational culture - contributed The company evidenced to have an organizational culture based on the informality of the adopted procedures, from the planning to the maintenance of the aircraft, which compromised the safe accomplishment of the operation. B) Organizational processes - contributed The company did not have an effective supervision system, allowing the aircraft to be used under inadequate conditions. 1.3 Operational Aspect 1.3.1 Concerning the operation of the aircraft A) Adverse weather conditions - contributed The meteorological conditions at the time of the occurrence made it difficult for the crew to locate the aerodrome, causing the aircraft to move away from the approach path to the runway which, added to the drag produced by the unfeathered propeller, aggravated the flight situation, contributing to the forced landing. B) Coordination of cabin - contributed The fact that the crew had been searching for the aerodrome, now turning their attention to the passenger who went to the cabin of the aircraft, or turning the attention to the engine failure, caused inattention as to the use of the checklist, resulting in non-compliance and failure to perform prescribed procedures, such as not feathering the left propeller by the propeller lever. This made it difficult to maintain the flight, because the windmilling propeller caused drag, culminating in the forced landing. C) Pilot trial - contributed The fact that the commander of the aircraft did not follow the procedures foreseen in the checklist, as suggested by the co-pilot after the engine failure, was decisive for the maintenance of the windmilling propeller, causing a drag that made it difficult to maintain the flight, contributing to forced landing. D) Maintenance of the aircraft - contributed The fact that the aircraft operator did not comply with the ANAC guidance related to the left engine condition with the overdue TBO, as well as not having identified the maintenance services performed and defined as not recommended by the manufacturer, contributed that the left engine was operated with the inappropriate governor connection, which resulted in loss of power in flight. E) Management oversight - contributed Supervision of aircraft maintenance activities was not adequate, allowing the aircraft to operate with nonconformities and culminating in in-flight engine failure. 1.3.2 Concerning ATS organs Not contributing. 2 Material Factor 2.1 Concerning the aircraft Not contributing. 2.2 Concerning equipment and technology systems for ATS Not contributing.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CENIPA Report number: A-122/CENIPA/2012 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Piquiatuba TÃ¡xi AÃ©reo   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All 82 passengers and eight crew members were killed. The airplane operated on Ethiopian Airlines flight ET409 from Beirut International Airport (BEY) to Addis Ababa-Bole Airport (ADD). Instruments meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, and the flight was on an instrument flight plan. It was night in dark lighting conditions with reported isolated cumulonimbus clouds and thunderstorms in the area. Flight ET409 was initially cleared by ATC on a LATEB 1 D Standard Instrument Departure (SID) from runway 21. Just before takeoff, ATC changed the clearance to an ""immediate right turn direct Chekka"". The Boeing 737 took off from runway 21 at 02:36. After takeoff ATC instructed ET409 to turn right on a heading of 315Â° and change frequencies and contact Beirut Control. ET409 acknowledged the clearance and continued a right turn. ATC instructed ET409 to turn left heading 270Â°, which was acknowledged. The flight continued the climbing left turn to heading 270Â° but did not maintain that heading. The aircraft continued on a southerly track. Just prior to reaching altitude of 7700 feet, the stick shaker activated, sounding for a period of 29 seconds. Meanwhile the airplane reached an angle of attack (AOA) of 32Â° and began a descent to 6000 feet. When the stick shaker ceased, the aircraft began to climb again. At 02:40:56, just prior to reaching 9000 feet, the stick shaker activated again, sounding for a period of 26 seconds. After reaching 9000 feet the aircraft made a sharp left turn and descended rapidly. The maximum registered bank angle was 118Â° left and the airplane reached a maximum registered speed was 407.5 knots at a G load of 4.412. The airplane disappeared from the radar screen and crashed into the Mediterranean Sea at 02:41:30. PROBABLE CAUSES: 1- The flight crew's mismanagement of the aircraft's speed, altitude, headings and attitude through inconsistent flight control inputs resulting in a loss of control. 2- The flight crew failure to abide by CRM principles of mutual support and calling deviations hindered any timely intervention and correction. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1- The manipulation of the flight controls by the flight crew in an ineffective manner resulted in the aircraft undesired behavior and increased the level of stress of the pilots. 2- The aircraft being out of trim for most of the flight directly increased the workload on the pilot and made his control of the aircraft more demanding. 3- The prevailing weather conditions at night most probably resulted in spatial disorientation to the flight crew and lead to loss of situational awareness. 4- The relative inexperience of the Flight Crew on type combined with their unfamiliarity with the airport contributed, most likely, to increase the Flight Crew workload and stress. 5- The consecutive flying (188 hours in 51 days) on a new type with the absolute minimum rest could have likely resulted in a chronic fatigue affecting the captain's performance. 6- The heavy meal discussed by the crew prior to take-off has affected their quality of sleep prior to that flight. 7- The aircraft 11 bank angle aural warnings, 2 stalls and final spiral dive contributed in the increase of the crew workload and stress level. 8- Symptoms similar to those of a subtle incapacitation have been identified and could have resulted from and/or explain most of the causes mentioned above. However, there is no factual evidence to confirm without any doubt such a cause. 9- The F/O reluctance to intervene did not help in confirming a case of captain's subtle incapacitation and/or to take over control of the aircraft as stipulated in the operator's SOP.METAR: 00:00 UTC / 02:00 local time: OLBA 250000Z 31008KT 280V340 8000 VCTS FEW020CB SCT026 13/06 Q1014 NOSIG= wind 310 degrees at 8 knots, variable from 280Â° to 340Â°; visibility 8km; thunderstorms in the vicinity; few clouds with cumulonimbus at 2,000 ft; scattered clouds at 2,600 ft; temperature 13 degrees C, dew point 6 degrees C, pressure 1014 hPa01:00 UTC / 03:00 local time: OLBA 250100Z VRB03KT 4000 SHRA FEW020CB BKN026 12/07 Q1014 NOSIG=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MoPW&T Report number: - Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   BBC  AlArabiya  OLBA (Beirut) SID departure charts   Location  Images: photo (c) Lebanon CAA / BEA photo (c) Lebanon CAA / BEA photo (c) Neil Randell; Lasham Airport (QLA/EGHL); 11 July 2009 photo (c) Werner Fischdick; London-Stansted Airport (STN/EGSS); 12 July 2006 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

At around 18:53 local time, the crew began the descent for an ILS approach to runway 09 at Grenoble Airport, France. It was a dark night with the moon still below the horizon. The crew was established on the localizer at about 10 nm from the runway threshold and had the runway in sight. At 19:23, at a height of approximately 1500 ft, the undercarriage was deployed at an indicated airspeed (IAS) 157 kt.  At a height of about 1000 ft, the crew disengaged the autopilot. The aircraft was stabilized at a slightly higher speed than Vapp, on the glide path and with a vertical speed of -700 ft/min. At a height of approximately 200 ft, the pilot flying disconnected the auto-throttle. The approach remained stabilized on the 3Â° glide path at a speed equal to Vapp + 3 kt and a descent rate of 700 ft/min until a height of 100 ft. Passing 100 ft, the IAS started to decrease and went below Vapp. The rate of descent increased to 850 ft/min. The pitch was 4Â° and the nose started to lift slightly. At a height of 30 ft, the plane passed slightly below the glide slope at an IAS of Vapp -4 kt. At a height of 15 ft, the elevator was operated abruptly causing a rapid increase in pitch attitude. Two seconds later, the rear fuselage touched down, with a pitch of 10.7Â°. The traces left on the runway indicate a contact point 166 meters before the touchdown zone. The vertical acceleration value reached a maximum of 1.95 g. Two seconds later, the throttles were brought back and the thrust reversers were deployed. The aircraft then rolled to the apron. CAUSE (translated from French): The accident was caused by continuing the landing when the situational awareness of the crew had deteriorated. This led to an inaccurate estimate of the height from the end point of the trajectory and no flare. The following factors contributed to the accident: - The crew did not select the maximum illumination of the landing lights; - Runway 09 at the Grenoble-IsÃ¨re airport is not equipped with visual indicator approach slope; - Management of the manual throttles to land was inadequate.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Report number: oy-p100206 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

None of the 92 passengers and four crew members were hurt. The domestic passenger flight CBE7222 from Mexico City-Benito JuÃ¡rez International Airport (MEX) was approaching Nuevo Laredo-Quetzalcoatl International Airport (NLD) when the main undercarriage failed to get down and locked. The crew decided to divert to Monterrey because the airport was better equipped to handle an emergency. Nuevo Laredo just has a single 2000 m runway. The crew carried out an emergency landing on runway 29 and came to rest on its right hand wing.

All six crew members and 46 passengers survived the accident. The domestic passenger flight TGN162 departed Tanjung Redep/Berau-Kalimaru Airport (BEJ) at 10:30 and climbed to Flight Level (FL) 140. Balikpapan approach cleared the crew direct to Samarinda Airport (SRI). The enroute part of the flight was uneventful. On approach to Samarinda, the crew was cleared to track direct to left downwind for runway 04. The controller informed them that the wind was 060 degrees at 12 knots. During the final approach for runway 04, the left ECU (Engine Control Unit) light illuminated followed by low oil pressure and torque indications. The captain decided to go around and divert to Balikpapan-Sepingan Airport (BPN) which was 92 km (50 NM) to the South. The flight crew carried out the engine shut-down procedure and commenced a climb to 4000 ft with the left engine inoperative. Approximately 16 Nm from Balikpapan Airport, while climbing through 3,800 feet, the right ECU light illuminated, immediately followed by low oil pressure and low torque indications. The right engine then failed. The crew broadcast a MAYDAY to Balikpapan Approach and decided to conduct a forced landing into a clear field in the Samboja area, about 16 Nm from the Balikpapan Airport. CAUSES: ""The both engine were lack of fuel before flame out, it was indicated the fuel management was out of control during flight that might be a misleading of fuel quantity indication.

Both pilots were killed. Flight TIE039C departed Prague-Ruzyne International Airport (PRG) at 20:08 on an IFR flight to Karlstad Airport (KSD), Sweden. The copilot was Pilot Flying. At 20:14, while the airplane was climbing to cruising altitude, the copilot asked the captain if she had ever flown a roll at night. Meanwhile, the air traffic controller at Prague cleared the flight to climb to FL260.  The flightcrew continued their conversation about performing a roll with Citation Bravo jets. At 20:17 the Pilot Flying rolled the 30Â° to the left and immediately 20Â° to the right. Prague ATC then instructed the flight to contact Munich ATC. Contact was established and clearance was given to climb from FL260 to FL330. This was confirmed by the crew. At 20:18 the captain asked the copilot if their altitude was high enough to perform a roll. The copilot confirmed that the altitude was sufficient. At 20:19 the flight levelled off at FL270. Five seconds later the nose pitched up to 14Â° and a roll to the right was initiated. Within four seconds the airplane was flying upside down. It rolled a further 90Â° in the next four seconds. Meanwhile the heading began to change and the nose dropped in an almost vertical dive of -85Â°. The computed airspeed increased from about 240 knots at the initiation of the roll to 380 knots during the descent. The flight crew were not able to recover and the airplane impacted a forest. CAUSES (translated from German): The accident is due to the fact that: - The crew attempted to perform maneuvers (roll) that are not planned for in commercial aviation. - The crew lost spatial orientation and subsequently the skill for a controlled recovery from the attained attitude. The following factors have contributed: - The pilots were not trained in aerobatics. - Night-time conditions existed, thereby lacking visual references. - The personal relationship between two pilots led to a lack of professional behavior while working together in the cockpit. - The aircraft was not designed or approved for aerobatics.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BFU Report number: BFU CX001-10 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) VÃ¡clav Kudela; Praha-Ruzyne International Airport (PRG/LKPR); 31 July 2005 photo (c) VÃ¡clav Kudela; Praha-Ruzyne International Airport (PRG/LKPR); 01 August 2005 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airline transport pilot and his seven passengers were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, which was originating at the time of the accident. The intended destination was Kipnuk, Alaska, and a company flight plan had been filed. The pilot said that the takeoff was normal, but at 200 feet above the ground and in a turn, he observed a reduction in power. He moved the emergency fuel control lever forward, and power was restored. Before the sink rate could be reversed, the airplane impacted the surface of a frozen lake, and the end of the right wing was bent up. The aileron was not damaged. For safety reasons, the pilot chose to fly straight ahead for 8 miles to Kongiganak, Alaska, where the flight landed without further difficulty. The right wing required a major repair to restore it to airworthy condition. A postaccident inspection disclosed no mechanical anomalies with the engine or its accessories, and the airplane was flown to its base after the wing was repaired without any engine problems noted. A weather study by a Safety Board meteorologist determined that the area was subject to light snow showers, freezing fog and mist, and surface temperatures below freezing, all conducive to wing/airframe icing. During an interview with Federal Aviation Administration inspectors, the pilot acknowledged seeing ""a trace of ice"" on the wings.

Of the 243 passengers and 19 crew members on board, 17 passengers and eight flight attendants (FA) received minor injuries and one FA received a serious injury.  The airplane received minor damaged.  The flight was operating under 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 121 as a regularly scheduled international passenger flight from Dulles International Airport (IAD), Washington, DC, to Narita International Airport (NRT), Narita, Japan. Prior to the turbulence encounter, the flight crew received pilot reports (PIREPs) of moderate to severe turbulence above FL340 and that it was less at FL300.  According to the flight crew, about one hour late, the flight began to encounter a few ""light bumps"" or intermittent light ""chop."" The sky conditions were clear with good visibility. The captain turned on the ""fasten seat belt"" sign and made a public address (PA) announcement to fasten seat belts. The flight crew requested a descent to FL300 and began to encounter moderate turbulence after starting the descent.  The first officer then made a PA announcement directing the flight attendants to ""take your seats."" The autopilot remained engaged throughout the turbulence encounter, which lasted less than one minute.   After encountering the turbulence, the crew assessed airplane damage and checked the number and severity of injuries to passengers and crew.  The crew was assisted in assessing passenger and crew injuries by a U.S. Army Special Forces medic who stated that all of the injuries were considered minor. All the FAs indicated that they were able to perform their required emergency duties for the remainder of the flight. After discussing the injuries and the available diversion airports with the FAs, company dispatch and the medic, the flight crew decided to continue on to NRT since there were sufficient diversion airports along the route if the situation worsened. Upon arrival in NRT, 16 passengers and one FA were transported to hospitals for medical evaluation.  All were released with only minor injuries, however, the FA was re-evaluated by her personal physician when she returned home with the further diagnosis of a fractured rib.

The aircraft had departed from Dar es Salaam. The en route part of the flight was uneventful. At 07:22 hours the flight contacted the Mwanza Tower controller and requested information about the location of the CB cloud which had earlier been mentioned by another aircraft in the area. Mwanza Tower informed the flight that there was a CB lying north east of the airport. The relevant METAR weather information was also transmitted to the flight. The pilot subsequently requested to use runway 30 and was cleared to do so. By that time the wind was 030Âº/18 kt and the visibility was 10 km. The aircraft proceeded to make a visual approach to the airfield and later reported field in sight. The captain was flying the aircraft. He testified that the approach to runway 30 and touchdown were all normal. He also claimed that after reverse thrust was selected, the aircraft entered a puddle of water that adversely affected its performance and controllability and caused it to veer off the runway. After covering 305 metres on grass, the aircraft came to rest on grass off the left edge of runway 30 some 1450 metres from the threshold. About 5 metres of the right wing was protruding into the runway and the nose section was resting on the tarmac surface of a service road.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIB Tanzania Report number: CAV/ACC/4/10 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: ippmedia.com, 14-3-2010   Location  Images: photo (c) anon.; Mwanza Airport (MWZ/HTMW); 01 March 2010 photo (c) Hansueli Krapf; Mwanza Airport (MWZ/HTMW); 14 September 2010; (sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

On final approach, when the landing gear was extended, the crew heard an abnormal noise and felt vibrations. They noticed that only two of the three green gear lock indicator lights were on. The unlit light was the left main gear lock indication. Five seconds later, the green hydraulic system pressure and level read zero. The crew declared an emergency and made their approach at minimum speed. During braking, the left main gear collapsed backwards. The aircraft went off the left side of the runway and came to rest on a strip of land 2000 meters past the runway threshold. The five crew members evacuated the aircraft without any problems. Causes of the accident: Fatigue cracking led to the failure of the left main gear hinge arm. This cracking was most probably initiated by a corrosion pit, which appeared and/or was not detected during the last general overhaul. The origin of this corrosion pitting could not be clearly identified. However, the investigation revealed certain deficiencies in the maintenance tasks carried out during the general overhaul of the gear. The implementation of incomplete and inadequate work cards and tracking sheets in the workshop may have contributed to the accident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Report number: tc-b100301 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 years and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Pprune  OIAX Notam   Location  Images: photo (c) U.S. Air Force photo by/Tech.

The airplane continued to its intended destination of Taipei-Taoyuan International Airport (TPE/RCTP), Taiwan. There were no injuries to the crew, and the airplane received substantial damage. When entering the required data into Runway Analysis System, the pilot took the Max Landing Weight as Max Take-Off Weight obtained from Computerized Flight Plan; which led the calculation to provide erroneous take-off thrust, take-off reference speed and take-off model. The aircraft did not obtain enough lift required for take-off, the angles of ground and attack were too large; which caused that the tail had ground contact. During the take-off roll, the pilot had stick shaker warning, then released stick and set the manual thrust to MAX to continue the take-off. In the air the pilot inspected the instruments of cabin pressure and engines which were normal. After landing at 16:48, maintenance personnel checked and found the rear section of aircraft belly had substantial damage Findings Related to Probable Causes: 1. When entering the required data into Runway Analysis System, CM 1 used the data from Computerized Flight Plan but took the max landing weight mistakenly as max take-off weight. Then CM 2 did not cross check to confirm the accuracy of the input data, and did not review all the data after retrieving take off performance figures from Runway Analysis System; so it was not discovered that the max take-off weight that was entered by mistake caused the mal-calculation of take-off thrust, -reference speed and -model. 2. CM 2 entered the erroneous take-off thrust provided by Runway Analysis System into Flight Management System which failed to calculate take-off reference speed; so the columns of V1, VR ,V2 on the page of the take-off speed showed Â- - - Â and the pilot did not understand the meaning of Â- - - Â, at the end he decided to use the take-off reference speed calculated by Runway Analysis System to enter into Flight Management System. 3. CM 3 has checked Runway Analysis Manual during taxiing to verify the accuracy of the calculation done by Runway Analysis System. However the source of Âmax take-off weightÂ was from the system and not from Weight and Balance Sheet nor Computerized Flight Plan. Therefore it was discovered that the take-off reference speed calculated by Runway Analysis System was much lower than the actual figure that the aircraft should have used. 4. When taking off the aircraft speed reached the VR value calculated by Runway Analysis System, 2 seconds later the aircraft started to roll. Because the actual roll speed of 149 knots/hour was lower than the correct value of 166 knots/hour, the aircraft did not have enough lift required for take-off and angles of ground and attack way too large; which caused the aircraft tail to touch ground.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ASC Report number: ASC-AOR-11-05-001 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft was tracking on a GURAK 3 standard instrument departure, which involved transiting through Pearce military controlled airspace. While maintaining flight level (FL) 120 and turning left onto a heading of 330 degrees under the control of Pearce air traffic control (ATC), the crew received a traffic advisory (TA) warning from the traffic alert and collision avoidance system (TCAS). The crew advised ATC and were instructed to continue the turn onto a heading of 360 degrees. During the turn, the crew received a resolution advisory (RA). The crew responded and climbed the aircraft to FL125. The crew were advised by ATC that the conflicting aircraft, a military-operated Raytheon Aircraft Company 350 (King Air) descending through FL120 on a reciprocal track, had the 717 in sight and was maintaining separation. By this time, the radar separation standard had reduced below the required distance of 3 NM (5.6 km). This occurrence reinforces the importance of effective coordination between ATC positions, and highlights the challenges faced by air traffic controllers when managing aircraft operating within the same airspace, but under the control of different ATC positions.Sources: ATSB AO-2010-014  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates24-Jul-2023 12:13 harro Updated Corrections or additions? ...

During takeoff from runway 10 at Manaus-Eduardo Gomes International Airport, the crew heard a loud external noise followed by a yaw to the right and then new noise, similar to a tire burst. Speed at the time of the occurrence was just below V1. The crew decided to abort the takeoff by reducing the thrust levers and engaging the spoilers. The aircraft did not have reversers and was partially controlled on the center of the runway with use of pedals and differential brakes. However, the aircraft could not be stopped on the runway and overran by about 400 m. Contributing factors (translated from Portuguese): a) Cockpit coordination - undetermined The diversity of configurations of the company's aircraft was a complicating factor in aircraft operation, and may have contributed to inadequate cockpit coordination at the time of takeoff abortion. b) Pilot unawareness - undetermined As the drag chute was optional equipment, it is possible that the crew has forgotten that the aircraft was equipped with this device. c) Pilot experience - contributed The pilot did not use the parachute by judging their use at low speed would be inefficient, and, as was optional equipment, there was no description of its use in the aircraft manual. d) Maintenance of aircraft - undetermined Tests conducted on wheels identified that the six connecting bolts of the right outer wheel torque with semicubos were approximately 90% lower than foreseen. It is possible that this fact has contributed to the tire deflation.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CENIPA Report number: IG-171/CENIPA/2013 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

One of the six occupants was injured. The flight took off from Helsinki-Vantaa Airport, Finland at 09:46 local time. The flight was uneventful until 10:14 hours, 9.5 nm from Tallinn runway 26. When the power levers were retarded to flight idle the crew noticed engine vibration and smelled a smoke in the cockpit. The engine chip detector indicator in the cockpit was lit. After a short discussion about which engine should be shut down the flight engineer shut down the left engine and the captain tried to start the APU to gain more thrust. During the approach the air traffic controller noticed the aircraft deviating from the approach path to the left and notified the crew. The crew was unable to maintain a proper approach path both in lateral and vertical dimensions. The attempts to start the APU engine failed. Visual contact with the runway was established 0.5 nm from the threshold. The aircraft crossed the airport boundary being not configured for landing and with an indicated airspeed (IAS) of 295-300 km/h. The flaps were extended for 10Â° over the threshold; the landing gear was lowered after passing the runway threshold and retracted again. The aircraft made a high speed low pass over the runway at an altitude of ca 10-15 feet with the landing gear traveling down and up again. Flaps were extended over the runway. At the end of the runway full power on the right engine was selected, and the aircraft climbed 15-20 feet and started turning left. The crew started retracting flaps and lowered the landing gear. The aircraft crossed the highway at the end of the runway at ca 30 feet, then descended again, colliding with treetops at the lake shore and made a crash-landing on the snow and ice-covered lake waterline. Due to the thick ice the aircraft remained on the ice and slid 151 m on the ice with heading 238Â° before coming to a full stop. After the impact the flight engineer shoot down the right engine and power and released all engine fire extinguishers. All persons onboard escaped immediately through the main door. No emergency was declared and despite suggestions from first officer, a go-around was not formally commanded. The airplane gradually sank through the ice after the accident. Causes of the accident: 1. The failure of the left engine lubrication oil system, leading to the failure of the rear compressor bearing and inflight engine failure. 2. The failure of the crew to maintain the approach path and adhere to single engine landing procedures. Factors contributing to the accident: 1. Improper and insufficient crew training, inter alia complete absence of simulator training 2. The lack of effective coordination between crewmembers 3. The failure of the crew to start RU19A-300 (APU) 4. Adverse weather conditions 5. Inadequate company supervision by Polish CAA, consisting in not noticing the lack of flight crew training and companies generally poor safety culture. 6. Inadequate company maintenance practices, leaving preexisting breather duct failure unnoticed.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ESIB Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) jaan@flickr; near Tallinn-Ãlemiste Airport (TLL); 18 March 2010; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane operated Aviastar-TU flight TUP1906 on a ferry service from Hurghada Airport (HRG), Egypt. All eight crew members survived the accident. The flight operated on a passenger service from Moskva-Domodedovo Airport to Hurghada the day before, carrying 210 passengers. Shortly after takeoff at 01:20, the crew noticed a burning smell in the cabin and returned to Domodedovo. An uneventful landing was carried out at 03:08. The problem turned out to be an electric heater that had malfunctioned. The flight continued to Egypt at 13:34 after repairs had been accomplished.  The return flight to Moscow was a ferry flight without passengers or cargo. Three flight crew members, an engineer and four flight attendants were on board when the airplane departed Hurghada at 19:00. On approach to Moscow the flight was cleared for a runway 14L ILS-approach. Weather was reported to the crew as: visibility at the beginning of runway 1300, mid-600, at the end of 550 m, vertical visibility 60 m, wind 170 degrees, at 2 m/sec. The airplane descended until it struck trees, cutting a swath trough the forest. It came to rest 1450 m short of the runway threshold and 150 m further to the right of the runway. Conclusion: Investigators concluded that the flight crew conducted an approach to the airport in below-minima weather conditions for an airplane with a defective flight control computer system. They failed to execute a go-around when failing to obtain visual contact with the ground. Contributing factors were: - Insufficient training of the crew to perform approaches at or near weather minima; - Lack of control over the activities of the crew, which led to poor resource management (CRM) of the captain; - Failure of the flight control computer system, which led to an increase in the allowed weather minima of the aircraft; - Failure of captain to divert to another airport; - Failure of captain to decide about a missed approach when there was visual contact with the approach lights; - Failure of the co-pilot to call for a missed approach; - Unsatisfactory interaction in the crew, resulting in a descent below safe altitude. Failure of the flight control computer system in flight (most likely due to unstable radio altimeters at altitudes exceeding their operating range) and the impossibility of ""removal"" of failure on this plane because of the lack of buttons to simulate the compression of the undercarriage, and inadequate crew training, and possibly fatigue, led to a significant increase of mental and emotional stress in which it it is not possible to make the best decision for the successful completion of the flight.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: MAK Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC)  Federal Agency for Air Transport   Location  Images: photo (c) MAK Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC); near Moskva-Domodedovo Airport (DME/UUDD); 22 March 2010 photo (c) MAK Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC); near Moskva-Domodedovo Airport (DME/UUDD); March 2010 photo (c) MAK Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC); near Moskva-Domodedovo Airport (DME/UUDD); March 2010 photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Moskva-Vnukovo Airport (VKO/UUWW); April 2000 photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Maastricht/Aachen Airport (MST/EHBK); July 1994 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Both pilots were killed.  The EMB-120 prepared to take off from the taxiway E2 intersection of runway 29. The flight was a training flight to revalidate the captain's command instrument rating. The supervisory pilot/training captain advised the aerodrome controller that the departure would incorporate asymmetric flight (a simulated engine failure), and was approved by the controller to perform the manoeuvre. Witnesses reported that the takeoff appeared 'normal' until a few moments after becoming airborne, when the aircraft rolled and diverged left from its takeoff path. They watched as the aircraft continued rolling left, and entered a steep nose-down attitude. The airplane impacted the ground in a right wing-low, nose-down attitude of about 65 degrees. A high intensity, fuel-fed fire that followed the collision with the ground destroyed most of the fuselage and cabin and right wing. CONTRIBUTING SAFETY FACTORS: - The pilot in command initiated a simulated left engine failure just after becoming airborne and at a speed that did not allow adequate margin for error. - The pilot in command simulated a failure of the left engine by selecting flight idle instead of zero thrust, thereby simulating a simultaneous failure of the left engine and its propeller autofeather system, instead of a failure of the engine alone. - The pilot under check operated the aircraft at a speed and attitude (bank angle) that when uncorrected, resulted in a loss of control. - The pilot under check increased his workload by increasing torque on the right engine and selecting the yaw damper. - The pilot in command probably became preoccupied and did not abandon the simulated engine failure after the heading and speed tolerance for the manoeuvre were exceeded and before control of the aircraft was lost.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ATSB Report number: AO-2010-019 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Two pilots killed in Darwin plane crash (Nationwide News, 22-3-2010)  ATSB Report 	AO-2010-019   Location  Images: photo (c) ATSB; Darwin Airport, NT (DRW/YPDN); 22 March 2010 photo (c) ATSB; Darwin Airport, NT (DRW/YPDN); 22 March 2010 photo (c) ATSB; Darwin Airport, NT (DRW/YPDN); 22 March 2010 photo (c) ATSB; Darwin Airport, NT (DRW/YPDN); 22 March 2010 photo (c) ATSB; Darwin Airport, NT (DRW/YPDN); 22 March 2010 photo (c) ATSB; Darwin Airport, NT (DRW/YPDN); 22 March 2010 photo (c) Ramon Vila; Darwin Airport, NT (DRW/YPDN); 01 April 2005 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The owner of Eurofox N829BM, with no intent to fly, placed a wooden chock under one of the main landing gear wheels and removed the upper engine cowl. He attempted to trouble shoot an engine starting problem on the Eurofox aircraft. The Eurofox engine started when his right knee contacted the starter switch as he attempted to enter the unoccupied aircraft. The Eurofox's engine continued to run causing the aircraft to jump the wooden chock and surge forward. The unoccupied aircraft traveled approximately 200 feet until it struck a Learjet 35A, registration N376HA. The Eurofox's right wing forward leading edge and wing tip struck the Learjet empennage tail section. The impact caused both the Learjet and the Eurofox to pivot in clockwise directions.

An Instrument Landing System approach was carried out and the aircraft touched down on the 6150 foot long runway 06. Following touchdown, the flight crew were unable to stop the aircraft prior to the end of the runway. The aircraft came to rest in deep mud, the nose wheel approximately 340 feet beyond the runway end and 140 feet beyond the edge of the paved runway end strip. A local fire department responded and arrived on-scene approximately 20 minutes after the aircraft departed the runway. The flight crew exited the aircraft using a ladder provided by the fire fighters. There were no injuries and the aircraft had minor damage. FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1. The aircraft touched down between 2000 and 2500 feet from the threshold and at a higher than required airspeed, which significantly increased the required runway length to safely stop the aircraft. 2. The presence of standing water on the runway caused the aircraft to hydroplane, which led to a loss of directional control and braking ability, significantly increasing the required stopping distance. 3. The reduction of reverse thrust following touchdown to realign with the runway centreline, in accordance with the manufacturer's recommended practice, increased the aircraft's required stopping distance. 4. The decision to carry out a pilot-flown-approach, rather than a pilot-monitored-approach, at night, in heavy rain, likely contributed to the aircraft's higher than required airspeed that was maintained until touchdown. 5. The combination of delayed touchdown point, higher than required touchdown speed, and standing water on the runway prevented the aircraft from stopping within the available landing distance. As a result, the aircraft overran the runway, coming to rest in deep mud.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: TSB Report A10A0032 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ  History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  17 April 2018 C-GCJZ Cargojet Airways 0 near Hamilton, ON (CYHM) min Engine failure Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The tug operator reported that he stopped on the ramp to pick up two bags. He exited the tug without setting its parking brake, turning off its engine, or placing the gear selector in neutral or park, which was not in accordance with the tug company's ground equipment general driving rules. The tug operator then placed the first bag on the passenger seat, which company procedures caution against doing. While the tug operator was handling the second bag, the unoccupied tug began to move because the first bag had fallen off the passenger seat onto the accelerator pedal. The tug moved forward, struck a hydrant fueling cart on the ramp, and then veered toward the left side of the airplane. The tug impacted both of the airplane's engines and its fuselage. If the tug operator had followed company driving rules, the accident could have been prevented. In addition, postaccident examination of the tug revealed that the electrical motor disengaging seat switch, which is designed to disengage the tug's electrical motor when weight is removed from the driver's seat, was inoperative; therefore, it did not prevent the tug from moving forward as designed.

All on board were killed in the accident, including Polish President Lech Kaczynski. The airplane departed Warszawa-Okecie Airport (WAW), Poland at 07:27 local time, carrying Polish President Lech Kaczynski, his wife, several Members of Parliament, President of the National Bank of Poland Slawomir Skrzypek, Chief of General Staff Franciszek Gagor, the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrzej Kremer and a number of passengers and crew members.  During the flight the crew was in contact with air traffic controllers at Minsk, Moscow and Smolensk. The crew also was in contact with the crew of a Polish Air Force Yakovlev 40 passenger plane that had landed at Smolensk Air Base 90 minutes ahead of the Presidential flight. At about 10:14 the flight descended through an altitude of 7500 m. Minsk Control radioed that the visibility at Smolensk Air Base was 400 m due to fog. The same conditions were transmitted to the crew when they contacted the controller at Smolensk. About 10:25 the pilot of the Yak-40 on the ground at Smolensk radioed that horizontal visibility was 400 m and vertical visibility about 50 m. Shortly afterwards they reported that an Ilyushin 76 transport plane had diverted to an alternate airfield after two attempts to land. The crew continued preparations for an approach to runway 26 at the Smolensk Air Base. The cockpit door was open and during the approach there were two passengers present on the flight deck. Meanwhile, visibility worsened to 200 m. This information was transmitted to the crew at 10:37. The crew requested permission to carry out a 'trial' approach to decision height (100 m) and asked the controller to expect a go around. About 18 seconds before impact the terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS) sounded: ""Pull up"", followed by an aural warning: ""TERRAIN AHEAD"". About 5 seconds before impact the autopilot and autothrottle were disconnected in order to execute a go around. The airplane contacted upsloping terrain at a distance of about 1100 meters from the runway and 40 m to the left of extended centreline. The aircraft height at that point was 15 m below the level of the runway threshold. The left wing struck a large tree causing the airplane to roll inverted. The Tu-154 crashed and broke up. The immediate cause of the accident was the failure of the crew to take a timely decision to proceed to an alternate airdrome although they were not once timely informed on the actual weather conditions at Smolensk ""Severny"" Airdrome that were significantly lower than the established airdrome minima; descent without visual contact with ground references to an altitude much lower than minimum descent altitude for go around (100 m) in order to establish visual flight as well as no reaction to the numerous TAWS warnings which led to controlled flight into terrain, aircraft destruction and death of the crew and passengers. According to the conclusion made by the pilot-experts and aviation psychologists, the presence of the Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Air Forces in the cockpit until the collision exposed psychological pressure on the PIC's decision to continue descent in the conditions of unjustified risk with a dominating aim of landing at any means. Contributing factors to the accident were: - long discussion of the Tu-154M crew with the Protocol Director and crew of the Polish Yak-40 concerning the information on the actual weather that was lower than the established minima and impossibility (according to the Tu-154M crew opinion) to land at the destination airdrome which increased the psychological stress of the crew and made the PIC experience psychological clash of motives: on the one hand he realized that landing in such conditions was unsafe, on the other hand he faced strong motivation to land exactly at the destination airdrome. In case of proceeding to an alternate airdrome the PIC expected negative reaction from the Main Passenger; - lack of compliance to the SOP and lack of CRM in the crew; - a significant break in flights in complicated weather conditions (corresponding to his weather minima 60x800) that the PIC had had as well as his low experience in conducting non-precision approach; - early transition by the navigator to the altitude callouts on the basis of the radio altimeter indications without considering the uneven terrain; - conducting flight with engaged autopilot and autothrottle down to altitudes much lower than the minimum descent altitude which does not comply with the FCOM provisions; - late start of final descent which resulted in increased vertical speed of descent the crew had to maintain. The systematic causes of the accident involving the Tu-154M tail number 101 aircraft of the Republic of Poland were significant shortcomings in the organization of flight operations, flight crew preparation and arrangement of the VIP flight in the special air regiment. In a separate investigation , the Polish Committee for Investigation of National Aviation Accidents concluded the following: Cause of Accident: The immediate cause of the accident was the descent below the minimum descent altitude at an excessive rate of descent in weather conditions which prevented visual contact with the ground, as well as a delayed execution of the go-around procedure. Those circumstances led to an impact on a terrain obstacle resulting in separation of a part of the left wing with aileron and consequently to the loss of aircraft control and eventual ground impact.  Circumstances Contributing to the Accident: 1) Failure to monitor altitude by means of a pressure altimeter during a non-precision approach;  2) failure by the crew to respond to the PULL UP warning generated by the TAWS;  3) attempt to execute the go-around maneuver under the control of ABSU (automatic go around);  4) Approach Control confirming to the crew the correct position of the airplane in relation to the RWY threshold, glide slope, and course which might have affirmed the crew's belief that the approach was proceeding correctly although the airplane was actually outside the permissible deviation margin;  5) failure by LZC to inform the crew about descending below the glide slope and delayed issuance of the level-out command;  6) incorrect training of the Tu-154M flight crews in the 36 Regiment.

The sky conditions were clear and the winds were estimated to be 5 to 8 knots. The takeoff was initiated on a slight downhill slope, into approximately 70 degrees of crosswind, with a minimum of 2000 feet available to a predetermined reject point. All engine parameters were normal; however, the aircraft did not accelerate as expected and the takeoff continued approximately 800 feet past the reject point, to an area where the terrain sloped more steeply into a depression. The aircraft became airborne at low speed over the depression and maximum power was applied in order to clear gently rising terrain ahead. The main gear contacted the ground on the far side of the depression, and the aircraft bounced and touched down a second time in an area covered by basketball size rocks.

The crew had carried out the sector from Hong Kong to Surabaya on the previous day. The accident aircraft stayed overnight at Surabaya Airport and was parked at Stand 8. The accident aircraft uplifted 24,400 kilogram (kg) of fuel and was prepared for departure. The flight was airborne at 08:24 local time. During the climb, the flight crew noticed some abnormal Engine Pressure Ratio (EPR) fluctuations on No. 2 engine, with a range of approximately Â± 0.015 around EPR target. No. 1 engine also had abnormal EPR fluctuations but within a narrower range. At 08:58, shortly after levelling off at FL390, an ECAM message ""ENG 2 CTL SYS FAULT"" was annunciated. ECAM information ""ENG 2 SLOW RESPONSE"" was shown for crew awareness. After consulting with a maintenance engineer, it was decided to continue since all engine parameters were considered normal other than the EPR fluctuations. Almost two hours into the flight, the same ECAM message appeared, with an additional information message ""AVOID RAPID THR CHANGES"". The engine anti-ice was selected on for both engines, but this had not effect. The crew then again contacted a maintenance engineer, who told them that he had seen these EPR fluctuations before and that the Fuel Metering Unit (FMU) of engine no. 2 would be replaced after landing. Nearing the destination, the crew began to prepare for a runway 07L arrival. According to recent weather information, significant windshear was forecast for both runway 07L and 07R. At 13:19 hrs local time during the descent to a cleared level of FL230, ECAM messages ""ENG 1 CTL SYS FAULT"" and ""ENG 2 STALL"" were annunciated within a short period of time. According to the Commander, a light ""pop"" sound was heard and some ""ozone"" and ""burning"" smell was detected shortly before the ECAM message ""ENG 2 STALL"". At that time the flight was at about 110 nautical miles southeast of Hong Kong, and was descending through FL300 with a Calibrated Air Speed (CAS) of 295 kt. Vertical mode ""Open Descent"" was selected. The flight crew completed the necessary ECAM actions and set No. 2 thrust lever accordingly to IDLE position. ECAM information ""ENG 1 SLOW RESPONSE"" and ""AVOID RAPID THRUST CHANGES"" were also annunciated. No. 1 thrust lever was advanced to Maximum Continuous Thrust (MCT) position as per the ""SINGLE ENGINE OPERATIONS"" strategy stated in the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH). However No. 1 engine N1 only temporary increased to about 57% N1 and then dropped back to about 37% N1 at 13:21 hrs. At 13:21 hrs, the flight crew declared ""PAN PAN"" to Hong Kong Radar and advised that No. 2 engine was operating at idle thrust. The crew made the request to shorten the track for a priority landing. Hong Kong Radar then cleared the flight to proceed directly to waypoint ""LIMES"".  At about 13:26 hrs, the Commander took control of the aircraft as the PF in accordance with Cathay standard operating procedures for one engine inoperative and the co-pilot became the Pilot Monitoring. At 13:30 hrs, when the aircraft was approximately 45 nm southeast from Hong Kong and was about to level off at 8,000 ft AMSL, ECAM message ""ENG 1 STALL"" was annunciated. The CAS at that moment was about 295 kt. ECAM actions were carried out by the flight crew and No. 1 thrust lever was put to IDLE position accordingly. Autothrust (A/THR) was disengaged and both engine master switches remained at the ""ON"" position. With both thrust levers at IDLE position, the Commander then tested the controllability of the engines by moving the thrust levers one at a time. There were no thrust changes corresponding to the engine lever movements initially. At 13:32 hrs, ECAM messages ""ENG 1 STALL"" was annunciated again. At 13:32 hrs, the crew declared ""MAYDAY"" and advised Hong Kong Approach of the double engine stall situation. CPA780 was then cleared to descend to 3,000 ft AMSL. At that time, the aircraft was still in Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) and the CAS was at about 233 kt and reducing. At around the same time, the Commander disconnected the Autopilot and the Flight Directors (FD) and flew the aircraft manually. The altitude increased from 6,760 ft to 7,164 ft AMSL with the CAS reducing and the aircraft started to descend again when the CAS decreased to about 200 kt.  When the aircraft was on base leg during the approach, the flight crew reported that they were flying in VMC. The crew moved the thrust levers to check the engine control but there was no direct response from the engines. The No. 1 engine speed eventually increased to about 74% N1 with the No. 1 thrust lever in the CLB (climb) detent position. The No. 2 engine speed remained at sub-idle about 17% N1, with the No. 2 thrust lever at the IDLE position.  At 13:37 hrs, the ATC made both runways 07L and 07R available for CPA780. During the descent and approach, there were a number of other ECAM warning messages announced in the cockpit which were not relevant to the engine control problem.  The flight crew carried out the ""ENG ALL ENG FLAMEOUT - FUEL REMAINING"" checklist in the QRH for No. 2 engine in an attempt to clear the thrust control fault of that engine. As per the checklist, the Ram Air Turbine (RAT) was deployed manually, APU bleed was selected ""ON"" and No. 2 engine MASTER switch was set to ""OFF"" then ""ON"" at 13:38 hrs. However, No. 2 engine remained at a sub-idle speed of 17% N1. At 13:38 hrs, Flap CONF 1 was selected. At 13:39 hrs, when CPA780 was at 5,524 ft AMSL, a CAS at 219 kt and a distance of nine nm from the airport, the Commander tried to decrease the speed by retarding the No. 1 thrust lever. However, there was no corresponding decrease in No. 1 engine speed. Eventually, No. 1 thrust lever was left at the IDLE position and No. 1 engine speed remained at 74% N1. At 13:40 hrs, Hong Kong Approach cleared CPA780 for a visual approach for Runway 07L. Flight crew deployed the speedbrakes when the aircraft was at 5,216 ft AMSL descending with a CAS of 234 kt at around 8 nm from the runway. Flight crew selected landing gear down shortly afterwards. The Commander aimed to fly the aircraft at a CAS as close as possible to the Minimum Selectable Speed (VLS), which was 158 kt at that time. The aircraft went through the runway extended centreline and recaptured the centreline from the north in order to manage altitude and airspeed.  At around 13:41 hrs, with the Maximum Allowable Speed (Vmax) at 240 kt and actual CAS at 244 kt, an overspeed warning was generated by the onboard system. A short while later Hong Kong Approach cleared CPA780 to land on runway 07L and advised that the current surface wind was 150 degrees at 13 kt. Flight crew stowed the speedbrakes when the aircraft was at 984 ft AMSL and armed the ground spoilers at 816 ft AMSL. At 13:42 hrs, when CPA780 was still at flap CONF 1, with a CAS of 227 kt and a vertical speed of 1,216 ft per min at an altitude of 732 ft AMSL and at about two nm to touchdown, the warning ""Too Low Terrain"" was generated by the Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS). Flap CONF 2 was selected at around one nm to touchdown with a CAS of 234 kt and at an altitude of 548 ft AMSL. A flashing ""F RELIEF"" message was displayed at Engine Warning Display (EWD) as the TE flap was extended to 8-degree position instead of the commanded 14-degree position. With a Vmax of 205 kt, another overspeed warning was generated shortly after Flap 2 selection. The ""Too Low Terrain"" warning changed to ""Pull Up"" warning briefly at 176 ft AMSL and back to ""Too Low Terrain"" within a very short timeframe. The EGPWS warning stopped at 24 ft above the ground. During the final approach, No. 1 engine speed decreased to about 70% N1 at touchdown, with the No. 1 thrust lever at IDLE position. No. 2 engine speed remained at about 17% N1 throughout the final approach and landing. CPA780 touched down on runway 07L at 13:43 hrs at a position between abeam Taxiways A4 and A5 and with a distance of around 680 metres (m) from the beginning of the runway threshold at a ground speed of 231 kt. The landing weight was approximately 173,600 kg. The landing wind was 143 degrees at 14 kt. Immediately after both main gears touched down on the runway, the right main gear bounced and the aircraft became airborne again briefly. The aircraft then rolled left seven degrees and pitched down to -2.5 degrees at the second touchdown during which, the lower cowling of No. 1 engine contacted the runway surface. Spoilers deployed automatically. Both engine thrust reversers were selected by the Commander. Only No. 1 engine thrust reverser was deployed successfully and ECAM message ""ENG 2 REV FAULT"" was annunciated. Maximum manual braking was applied. As required by the company procedure for the purpose of drawing the PFÂs attention in the status of the deceleration devices, the co-pilot called out ""no spoilers, no REV green, no DECEL"" during the landing roll. The aircraft came to a complete stop on the runway at a position just passed Taxiway A10, with its nose wheel at about 309 m from the end of Runway 07L. The total distance for stopping the aircraft from the initial touchdown was approximately 2,630 m. The crew shut down the engines and requested the tower controller to check for a possible wheel fire. There was no sign of fire. An emergency evacuation was then ordered just after 13:45. One passenger sustained serious injuries in the evacuation while 56 passengers and six crew members sustained minor injuries. Causes: The accident was caused by fuel contamination. The contaminated fuel, which contained SAP spheres, uplifted at WARR subsequently caused the loss of thrust control on both engines of the aircraft during approach to VHHH. The following chain of events and circumstances had led to the uplift of contaminated fuel to CPA780: i. The re-commissioning of the hydrant refuelling system after the hydrant extension work in WARR had not completely removed all contaminants in the affected hydrant refuelling circuit. Salt water remained in the affected hydrant refuelling circuit.  ii. The re-commissioning of the hydrant refuelling system after the hydrant extension work in WARR was not properly coordinated which led to the premature resumption of the hydrant refuelling operations while the hydrant system still contained contaminant.  iii. The refuelling operation in WARR, in particular low flow-rate refuelling, DP recording and monitoring, did not fully comply with the international fuel industry latest guidance. iv. A number of unscheduled filter monitors replacements after the premature resumption of hydrant refuelling operation were not investigated by the fuel supplier and hydrant operator at WARR.  v. The unusual vibration observed during the refuelling of CPA780 was not stopped immediately and properly investigated by the fuel supplier personnel.  The investigation also identified the following deficiencies and contributing factors that may cause possible fuel contamination:  i. There were no established international civil aviation requirements for oversight and quality control on aviation fuel supply at airports.  ii. There were no established international civil aviation requirements for refuel operational procedures and associated training for aviation fuel supply personnel. iii. The manual monitoring of DP changes in a fuelling dispenser during refuelling was not effective.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CAD Hong Kong Report number: 2/2013 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  8 September 2016 B-HLL Cathay Dragon 0 Hong Kong-Chek Lap Kok International Airport (HKG/VHHH) min Collision with Ground support equipment Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All 103 passengers and seven crew members survived but ten sustained serious injuries. Merpati Flight MNA836 operated on a scheduled flight from Sorong-Dominique Edward Osok Airport (SOQ/WAXX). Departure was delayed for almost three hours due to heavy rain over Manokwari. The flight was planned under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR). The destination, Manokwari, had no published instrument approach procedure. Terminal area operations, including approach and landing, were required to be conducted under the Visual Flight Rules (VFR). At 10:46 the crew made the first direct contact with Rendani Radio and reported their position as 14 Nm from Manokwari, and maintaining altitude 10,500 feet. Following this radio contact, Rendani Radio informed the crew that the weather was continuous slight rain, visibility 3 kilometers, cloud overcast with cumulus-stratocumulus at 1,400 feet, temperature 24 degrees Celsius, QNH 1012 hectopascals. The controller then instructed the crew to descend and joint right downwind for runway 35, and to report when overhead the airport. Shortly after, the crew reported overhead the airport at 5,000 feet. The controller then instructed the crew to report when they were on final approach for runway 35. The crew acknowledged this instruction. At 10:54 the crew reported that they were on final for runway 35. The controller informed them that the wind was calm, runway condition was wet and clear. The crew read back the wind condition and that the runway was clear, but did not mention the wet runway condition. The aircraft was observed to make a normal touchdown on the runway, about 120 meters from the approach end of runway 35. Witnesses on the ground and on board reported that engine reverser sound was not heard during landing roll.  During the landing roll, the aircraft veered to the left about 140 meters from the end of runway 35, then overran the departure end of runway 35. It came to a stop 205 meters beyond the end of the runway in a narrow river; the Rendani River. The airport rescue and fire fighting unit was immediately deployed to assist the post-crash evacuation. Due to the steep terrain 155 meters from the end of runway 35, the rescuers had to turn back and use the airportÂs main road to reach the aircraft. The accident site was in an area of shallow muddy water surrounded by mangrove vegetation. Rendani has a single runway, 17/35, measuring 2.000 m x 30 m.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSC Report number: KNKT.10.04.09.04 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: Kementerian Perhubungan (Ministry of Transport) Indonesia   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSC; Manokwari-Rendani Airport (MKW/WASR); April 2010 photo (c) NTSC; Manokwari-Rendani Airport (MKW/WASR); April 2010 photo (c) NTSC; Manokwari-Rendani Airport (MKW/WASR); April 2010 photo (c) NTSC; Manokwari-Rendani Airport (MKW/WASR); April 2010 photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Seattle/Tacoma International Airport, WA (SEA/KSEA); September 1995 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Subsequently, the crew noticed the left engine also leaking oil, with a fluctuating oil pressure, so they initiated a diversion to Bristol, where they landed safely. The oil leaks were traced to damaged O-ring seals within the oil cooler fittings on both engines. Both oil coolers had been removed and refitted during the base maintenance check at Exeter. It was probably during re-installation that the O-ring seals were damaged.

On landing, the airplane exited the runway to the right and came to a stop leaning on the fuselage. Examination of the airplane showed that the landing gear was retracted with the landing gear doors open. The landing on the fuselage resulted from an incomplete analysis by the crew of the consequences of the electrical failure and the warning that triggered during the final approach. The airplane operated on a repositioning flight from New Caledonia to Wallis Island via Nadi, Fiji, in preparation for medevac flight. Causes of the Accident: At night in adverse meteorological conditions, the crew decided to continue with the approach and to land, while the landing gear was not locked in the down position due to the failure of the secondary electric circuit. The origin of this failure was probably the increase in the number of operating cycles of the hydraulic power pack which delivers the hydraulic energy required to extend and retract the landing gear. This led to the failure of the diodes in the protective secondary circuit, which could not be checked in flight.  The decision to continue the approach resulted from incorrect comprehension of the electrical failure and the aural warning that sounded during the final approach. The conviction that the landing gear was locked down, associated with the meteorological conditions and the failure of the circuit-breakers to trip, did not prompt the crew to correctly assess the risk associated with the electrical failure.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Report number: f-an100424 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 years and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Fiji Times   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane came to rest 167 metres past the runway threshold and 4 metres below runway elevation. PROBABLE CAUSE: (translated from Spanish) The Board of Inquiry found that the probable cause of the accident was the execution of a landing on runway 20 at Mitu, following a destabilized approach especially with respect to deviations of height and speed when crossing the runway threshold, and the EGPWS alarm sound, which caused the aircraft to exceed the available runway. Additionally, the crew used  faulty techniques for landing on short and wet runways. Contributing to the accident was the lack of planning to carry out and complete the published instrument approach procedure for runway 20 and the deviation from standard operating procedures of the company.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Aerocivil Report number: COL-10-11-GIA Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Aviacol   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

On May 6 the crew carried out several flights. Before the accident flight, it was refueled with 300 liters of gasoline and 700 liters of chemicals. Takeoff weight was 4,820 kg. During takeoff, at a height of 10-15 meters, the crew heard noise from the carburetor, and then engine failed. The pilot in command performed a forced landing straight ahead on a shallow river bed. Both crew members survived.  The airplane was dismantled and the fuselage cut in two before the accident investigators reached the scene. CONCLUSION (translated from Russian): The accident of airplane AN-2 RA-40373 was the result of the nose striking the ground during the execution of a forced landing due to shutdown of the ASz-62IR engine while in the process of taking off, most likely due to ingress of water into the carburetor from the fuel system of the aircraft, which led to the shutdown of the engine. The cause of the accident was a combination of the following factors: - failure to comply with guidelines in part: checking facility for storing and dispensing aviation fuels and lubricants, monitoring and verification of the fuel sludge discharge after refueling for the lack of water and solids; - execution of a forced landing straight ahead outside the landing area on difficult terrain, covered with forests, a rugged ravine and a creek.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) MAK; Goryachy Klyuch; May 2010 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Tambo International Airport (JNB/FAOR)","Tripoli International Airport (TIP/HLLT)","Accident investigation report completed and information captured","Afriqiyah Airways flight 771, an Airbus A330-202, crashed on approach to Tripoli International Airport, Libya. There were 11 crew members and 93 passengers on board. One passenger survived the accident. On May 11, 2010 at 19:45 UTC, the aircraft departed Johannesburg-O.R. Tambo International Airport (JNB), South Africa on an international passenger flight to Tripoli. The co-pilot was pilot flying. The en route part of the flight was uneventful.  The captain contacted the Tripoli ACC controller at 05:29 local time (02:29 UTC) and received clearance direct to Tripoli for a TW locator approach to runway 09. Weather was reported as: wind calm, visibility 6 km, clear sky, temperature/dew point 19/17Â°C, QNH 1008. After receiving further descent clearances, the crew contacted the Tripoli Tower controller at 05:58. Tripoli Tower cleared the aircraft to continue the approach and to report runway in sight. The flight then received information from a flight that had landed ahead of them, informing the accident crew about fog patches noticed during short final. At 06:00 the flight passed the TW locator beacon at an altitude of 1000 feet, 200 ft below the prescribed altitude. The captain then informed ATC that he would report when runway in sight. The approach was continued below the Minimum Descent Altitude of 620 feet but the crew still did not have the runway in sight. At an altitude of 280 feet the GPWS sounded ('too low terrain'). The captain then instructed the co-pilot to execute a go-around, after which he informed the Tower controller. The aircraft began to climb, reaching an altitude of 450 feet above ground level. The Airbus then nosed down, causing the captain to take priority over the flight controls by pushing on priority button and the aircraft was fully under the captain's control who applied a sharp nose down input. The captain did not verbally state that he was taking control. He applied a pitch-up and a pitch-down input on his stick until the airplane impacted the ground 1200 m from the threshold of runway 09 with high energy (-4400 ft/min) and high longitudinal velocity (260 kts). The aircraft broke up, leaving an 800 m long wreckage trail. PROBABLE CAUSE: A final approach carried out in common managed guidance mode should have relieved the crew of their tasks. The limited coordination and cooperation between the two crew members, especially the change into vertical selected guidance mode by the PF, probably led to a lack of a common action plan. The lack of feedback from the 28 April 2010 flight, flown by the same crew on the same aircraft, did not allow them to anticipate the potential risks associated with managing non-precision approaches. The pilots'  performance was likely impaired because of fatigue, but the extent of their impairment and the degree to which it contributed to the performance deficiencies that occurred during the flight cannot be conclusively determined. During the go-around, the crew was surprised not to acquire visual references. On one hand the crew feared exceeding the aircraftÂs speed limits in relation to its configuration, and on the other hand they were feeling the effects of somatogravic illusion due to the aircraft acceleration. This probably explains the aircraft handling inputs, mainly nose-down inputs, applied during the go-around. These inputs were not consistent with what is expected in this flight phase. The degraded CRM did not make it possible for either crew member to identify and recover from the situation before the collision with the ground, even when the TAWS warnings were activated close to the ground. Based on elements from the investigation, the accident resulted from: - The lack of common action plan during the approach and a final approach continued below the MDA, without ground visual reference acquired. - The inappropriate application of flight control inputs during a go- around and on the activation of TAWS warnings, - The lack of monitoring and controlling of the flight path. These events can be explained by the following factors: - Limited CRM on approach that degraded during the missed approach. This degradation was probably amplified by numerous radio-communications during the final approach and the crewÂs state of fatigue, - Aircraft control inputs typical in the occurrence of somatogravic perceptual illusions, - Inappropriate systematic analysis of flight data and feedback mechanism within the AFRIQIYAH Airways. - Non adherence to the company operation manual, SOP and standard terminology.

The Turbine Otter had refueled at Arcachon, France and departed the paved runway. After takeoff the pilot forgot to retract the wheels and prior to landing on the water he forgot to verify that the wheels were retracted.  Normally an aural and visual warning system activates when the wheels are still out when the airspeed drops below 70 mph. In this case the approach speed for the landing was 85 mph because of the wind conditions, so the system did not activate. Furthermore, the pilot's attention was focused on the unexplained presence of floating foam near the landing zone. This foam came from a demonstration dump conducted by a Canadair aircraft shortly before the accident.Sources: BEA  Biscarrosse : un hydravion bascule Ã  l'amerissage  Biscarrosse 2010 : Un Single Otter s'Ã©crase sur le lac   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane was substantially damaged when the flap portion impacted the fuselage. There were no injuries to the flight crew and the airplane landed without further incident. The cargo flight originated from Rio de Janeiro-GaleÃ£o-Antonio Carlos Jobim International Airport (BGL), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  According to the operator, the flight crew heard and felt a large impact after 30 degree flaps was selected during the approach.  Postflight inspection revealed that approximately twelve feet of the right wing inboard fore flap was missing and had caused substantial damage to the aft fuselage. The separated section of the fore flap was recovered and examined. The examination revealed that a large portion of the enamel was missing from the fore flap attachment fitting of the carriage assembly and that there was a large amount of contamination and grease buildup around the lubrication fitting. Extensive corrosion byproducts covered up the lubrication passage in the attachment, which prevented passage of grease to the bearing, causing extensive corrosion in the bore and propagated by fatigue before final ductile separation. Probable Cause: impact of the fore flap with the aft fuselage after fatigue failure of the right wing fore flap carriage assembly attachment fitting at position 6.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA10CA061 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 years and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates19-Aug-2017 09:44 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

The wreckage was scattered over the mountainside. According to Al Jazeera the airline bought the plane 3 months ago from Bulgaria. Soviet Transports Fleet data indicate that YA-PIS was recently acquired by Pamir after a period of storage in Bulgaria. An inquest was held at Bradford Crown Court, U.K. because three British men were on the plane. During the inquest it was reported that an early ground proximity warning system was misunderstood by the crew, either due to language problems or because of previous false alerts. Also, the Kabul air traffic controller asked the crew to maintain their current altitude but the plane began its descent in bad weather into a mountainous area about 12 miles from Kabul.Sources: Al Jazeera  BBC  Pamir Airways statement  Afghan Army and ISAF Planning Recovery Operations (NATO 20-5-2010)  The Yorkshire Post, 24-6-2015   Location  Images: photo (c) Dimitar Nozharov; Salang Pass; 19 May 2010 photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; MÃ¼nchen-Franz Josef Strauss Airport (MUC/EDDM); January 2005 photo (c) Ferenc HAMORI, via Miklos SZABO; Budapest-Ferihegy Airport (BUD/LHBP); 26 September 2006 photo (c) VÃ¡clav Kudela; Ostrava-MoÅ¡nov International Airport (OSR/LKMT); 30 August 2005 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane was configured with full flaps and when the pilot went to actuate the landing gear he diverted his attention to his deteriorating airspeed and glide path deviation. The pilot made the necessary correction to stabilize the approach. At 500 feet above the ground, the pilot glanced over to the gear indicator and thought he saw ""three down."" The pilot continued the approach and the airplane landed with the gear in the retracted position. Neither pilot reported hearing the gear warning horn which should have actuated when the pilot selected greater than half flaps and the gear was not properly configured.

Both pilots escaped unhurt. The airplane operated on a cargo flight from Sorocaba Airport to Cascavel. Weather at the destination was poor with limited visibility in fog and a 100 ft overcast. The crew attempted to land, but touched down in a soy bean field about 700 m from the runway 33 threshold. The airplane traveled about 150 meters before coming to rest on its belly. The only navigational aid available at Cascavel is NDB. Contributing Factors 1 Human Factor 1.1 Medical Aspect a) Fatigue - undetermined It is probable that fatigue occurred, considering that the day before the accident, the crew performed a journey longer than 24 hours, which would be 16 hours, taking into account the type of crew, as well as the rest time. b) Visual illusions - contributed It is possible that the crew landed before the runway due to false sensory impressions generated by the dark environment surrounding the aerodrome and the low visibility conditions at the time of the accident (black hole effect). 1.2 Psychological Aspect 1.2.1 Individual Information a) Attitude - contributed Excessive self-confidence in equipment and mission influenced the takeoff of Sorocaba in weather conditions unfavorable to landing in Cascavel. b) Motivation - contributed The pilot demonstrated to be adapted to the work environment and the flight routine, however he showed a high motivation to fulfill the mission as it was programmed, in order to cause the minimum of interference in the aerial programming of the company. (c) Decision-making - contributed The pilots operated at night, a condition that in itself modifies visual perception, although the pilot in command was adapted to routine and recognized that their cognitive abilities could be diminished. In addition, the flight was accompanied by difficulties, such as adverse weather conditions, making it difficult to see and to process information. These conditions added to the stress of the situation compromised the judgment and the decision. 1.2.2 Psychosocial Information a) Team dynamics - contributed The aircraft commander did not request the support of the co-pilot to carry out the descent procedure, took over the operation and intended to make the landing, despite the weather. The co-pilot, being inexperienced, trusted the commander and did not interfere, despite realizing the dangerous conditions. 1.2.3 Organizational Information a) Physical conditions of work - indeterminate Work shifts that generate changes in routines very often require the need for constant physiological adaptations. This condition can lead to the development of fatigue, creating favorable conditions for human error. b) Organizational culture - contributed Flexibility is observed with respect to compliance with flight rules, with low levels of knowledge and application of flight safety strategies. The company was compliant with the changes in operating procedures. c) Training, Training and Training - contributed There was a fragile process of training and qualification of new pilots, with deficient monitoring of personnel and the use of missions to train the crew. d) Organization of work - indeterminate The aerial activity of the company consisted in the service to fixed clients, being important the conservation of the routines of work, to well serve the users. This caused that changes in the meteorological conditions generated much disorder, since the routes had to be altered, generating costs and time. The crew, on the other hand, probably tried to minimize the interpretation of the adversities in order to force the execution of the planned activity. e) Organizational processes - undetermined There may have been a lack of continuous supervision of the aerial activity of the different flights underway. 1.3 Operational Aspect 1.3.1 Concerning the operation of the aircraft a) Coordination of cabin - contributed It became evident that communication between the crew was compromised by inadequate management of the tasks assigned to each one, probably due to the difference between the high experience of the pilot in command and the lack of experience of the co-pilot. b) Flight Discipline - contributed The crew intentionally violated operational rules, regulations and air traffic regulations without any justification for doing so. c) Influence of the environment - undetermined The region near the threshold of runway 33 had visibility-limiting environmental conditions, as it was an area of low demographic density, almost unlMETAR: 08:00 UTC / 05:00 local time: SBCA 190800Z 33015KT 1200 -DZ BR PRFG OVC001 08/08 Q1014=Wind 330 degrees at 15 knots; visibility 1200m; light drizzle, mist, partial fog; overcast at 100 ft; temperature 8Â°C, dew point 8Â°C; 1014 hPa09:00 UTC / 06:00 local time: SBCA 190900Z 32012KT 2000 -DZ BR PRFG OVC001 08/08 Q1014=Wind 320 degrees at 12 knots; visibility 2000m; light drizzle, mist, partial fog; overcast at 100 ft; temperature 8Â°C, dew point 8Â°C; 1014 hPaAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: CENIPA Report number: A - 034/CENIPA/2012 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: AviÃ£o tenta pousar em aeroporto fechado e acaba em fazenda em Cascavel (PR) (Folha Online)  Edson Dantas   Location  Images: photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Rio de Janeiro-Santos Dumont Airport, RJ (SDU/SBRJ); January 1979 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.
