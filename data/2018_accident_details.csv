Medical assistance was requested via ATC. The aircraft landed normally at the destination airport.   The presence of the area of severe turbulence close to the Alps over Northern Italy was foreseen and represented on the flight documentation available to the crew. The captain had briefed the cabin crew as such. After numerous calls on frequency from crews of other aircraft that were passing through the turbulence area, the captain reiterated to the CCM4, who had entered the cabin, the presence of the turbulence area. The captain then warned the passengers to return to their seats and activated the seat belt sign. Shortly before the encounter with the turbulence, the captain warned a cabin crew member, via intercom, that the crew had to sit down due to the impending turbulence. During entry into the area of severe turbulence, the FDR recorded maximum vertical acceleration values of -1.20 G and + 2.76 G, with a maximum variation of + 3.96 G.  The flight controls remained in normal law without any degradation of the control mode. AP and A / THR remained regularly engaged throughout the period in which the aircraft was affected by the turbulence. During the severe turbulence, the cabin crew were each still not secured in their seats. Three cabin crew members were injured (SCCM, CCM2 and CCM3). The cabin crew members were initially taken to Verona hospital for first aid. The SCCM, who suffered a fractured leg, was later transferred to the UK for surgery. CCM2 suffered a contusion injury to the left hemi-costat. CCM3 sustained a lacerated contusion wound to the scalp. CAUSES The accident was caused by a sudden encounter with severe turbulence during the descent with the cabin crew not yet secured in their seats.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ANSV Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 years and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: http://www.ansv.it/It/Detail_relazioni.asp?ID=2089  https://bea.aero/les-enquetes/evenements-notifies/detail/accident-de-lairbus-a319-immatricule-g-dbca-et-exploite-par-british-airways-survenu-le-03-01-2018-pres-de-verone-enquete-menee-par-ansv---italie/  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates06-Jan-2018 12:29 gianniprof Added 06-Jan-2018 12:31 harro Updated [Aircraft type, Cn, Operator, Total fatalities, Other fatalities, Location, Nature, Departure airport, Narrative, ]17-Jun-2024 10:54 ASN Updated [Category, ]28-Jun-2024 19:24 ASN Updated [Time, Narrative, Accident report, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The jet carried four passengers and a three-person crew. The aircraft was parked at the north end of the apron. Once the passengers had left, the flight crew put covers on the engines and external sensors. The next planned flight was a positioning flight on 4 January 2018, to Ekaterinburg, Russia, without passengers. The crew arrived at the airport to prepare for the flight at approximately 15:00. Take-off, as per the flight plan, was to happen at 17:00. The ground handling company transported them to the aircraft by bus at approximately 15:20. The captain opened the door at which time the cabin assistant entered the cabin. The captain and the co-pilot placed their flight bags behind the cockpit and went back outside. The co-pilot placed the aircrew's baggage into the rear baggage compartment which opens from the outside. The captain and the co-pilot removed the engine covers which they had put in place on the day of their arrival. These were put into their own storage bags and also placed in the baggage compartment. Following this, the captain went into the cockpit and started the APU, which generates electricity for aircraft systems and bleed air for heating the cabin. The co-pilot began to brush off the snow that had fallen on the aircraft. A moment later the captain came out to help the co-pilot. At first, he worked with his bare hands. Due to the extremely cold conditions (-22Â°C), however, he went back inside to fetch a pair of gloves. When he came back out, he closed the door. A little later the cabin assistant inside the cabin felt strange pressure in her ears and chest. She went into the cockpit and attempted to get the attention of the pilots working outside by knocking on the window. The pilots noticed the knocking and the captain went to open the door. According to the co-pilotÂs observations it was unusually difficult for the captain to get the door open. Then, the captain pulled harder on the door handle at which time the door blew open with excessive force, hitting the captain who was standing underneath the door and knocking him to the ground. The pressure wave also knocked the co-pilot down, who had been standing approximately one metre from the left side of the door. The co-pilot stood up and saw the captain lying on his back on the ground. Realising that the captain was unconscious, the co-pilot turned him on his side. Then he entered the cabin and saw the cabin assistant in a semi-seated position on the floor of the cabin. The co-pilot shook the assistantÂs shoulder and advised her to go outside.  The captain died as a result of the serious injuries he sustained at the site of the occurrence. The co-pilot had not sustained any physical injuries. The cabin assistant had bruises on her right arm, continued to feel chest pain and was diagnosed with a mild concussion.  The cabin sustained substantial damage. The cockpitÂs aft left bulkhead and the cabinÂs forward left bulkhead were nearly torn off. CONCLUSIONS: 1. When the aircraft is parked outside for a longer period, some pilots may close the outflow valve to prevent the ingestion of contaminants into the valve, or upstream into the cabin. 2. When the APU is being run one must check that the outflow valve is fully open. If it is not possible to ensure that the valve is open or to remove differential pressure by other means, the door must not be closed. 3. The door had no indication warning of excessive cabin pressure, nor an opening for depressurisation. The cabin was pressurised because the APU bleed air was ducted into the cabin, the outflow valve was closed and the door was also closed. Significant differential pressure existed between the cabin and the outside. 4. Cabin pressurisation on the ground also creates a hazard for several other groups of professionals, such as aircraft mechanics, ground handling staff, aircraft cargo loaders and rescue personnel.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIB Finland Report number: L2018-01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) Safety Investigation Authority, Finland; KittilÃ¤ Airport (KTT0; 04 January 2018 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

WestJet flight 2425, a Boeing 737-800 registered C-FDMB, landed on runway 24R at 17:39 hours local time following a flight from CancÃºn, Mexico. The flight taxied to Terminal 3 and was stopped with the engines and APU running, on Taxi-lane 2 on the north side of Pier B. The flight crew were waiting for ground personnel to marshal the aircraft into position at Gate B12. The WestJet aircraft was positioned directly behind and perpendicular to a Sunwing Airlines Boeing 737-800 (C-FPRP), which was parked at Gate B13.  The Sunwing aircraft was being prepared to be towed to another location at the airport. A Sunwing maintenance technician was in the cockpit of C-FPRP, and the aircraft's APU was running. Two ground personnel were in the cab of the tow vehicle. The tow vehicle was informed by the North Apron controller to pushback at their discretion. The Sunwing aircraft (under tow) began to move back and the APU contacted the right wing of the stationary WestJet aircraft. A fire rapidly ensued. The WestJet flight crew immediately commenced the required steps for an evacuation, and an evacuation was ordered shortly after. The tow vehicle operator pulled the Sunwing aircraft back towards the gate to separate the two aircraft. The slides on the WestJet aircraft were utilized on doors L1, R1 and L2, along with the over-wing exits on the left side; all passengers evacuated safely. The maintenance technician aboard the Sunwing aircraft exited the left cockpit window using the emergency rope and received minor injuries. ARFF arrived at the scene, and extinguished the fire. The Sunwing aircraft sustained substantial damage. Summary: In this accident, the pushback was conducted without the use of wing walkers, which is not in accordance with Swissport, Sunwing, and GTAA requirements. The investigation also determined that wing walkers were normally used by Swissport only when pushing back aircraft with passengers on board. In addition, the GTAA apron radio officer used phraseology that was not consistent with GTAA AMU procedures. WestJetÂs pre-flight safety briefings do not inform passengers to leave behind carry-on baggage in the event of an evacuation. During this occurrence, several passengers retrieved their carry-on baggage, despite the fact that FAs repeatedly provided specific instructions to the contrary. These passenger actions, in combination with the lack of emergency lighting, delayed the evacuation process.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A18O0002 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) TSB Canada; Toronto-Pearson International Airport, ON (YYZ); 05 January 2018 photo (c) TSB Canada; Toronto-Pearson International Airport, ON (YYZ); 05 January 2018 photo (c) Janos ENGLERT; Calgary International Airport, AB (YYC/CYYC); 11 March 2016 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Kennedy International Airport, USA. The right-hand wingtip of a Boeing 777-31BER (B-7185) operated by China Southern Airlines struck the APU in the tail of a Boeing 777-369ER (9K-AOC), operated by Kuwait Airways.  There were no personal injuries. Kuwait Airways flight KU117, a Boeing 777-300ER (9K-AOC), landed at 18:41 local time and due to lack of gates available, was assigned Hardstand 63. Due to a light pole adjacent to Hardstand 63 blocking the offload of the forward hold, both ground handling agencies coordinated in parking the aircraft short of the 777-300 stop mark to allow for the offloading of the forward hold.    The aircraft was parked on the 737 stop mark at 1855 LT and due to the tail overhanging into taxiway BB, that was closed.   China Southern flight CZ300, a Boeing 777-300 (B-7185), was towed off gate 6 at Terminal 4 at 20:00 LT with no available hardstand to park, so the aircraft was towed around the terminal area as needed during the traffic congestion until a hardstand was available.   Just prior to 23:40 LT, Hardstand 73 became available, and China Southern CZ300 was under tow at Spot 2 behind Terminal 4.  china southern cz300 was instructed  to proceed to hardstand 73 from spot 2 via taxiway g, taxiway bb, and taxiway h.   The pushback driver proceeded to turn right on taxiway G, then right onto taxiway BB (which had been closed earlier due to the KU overhang) and the right wing tip of CZ300 impacted the tail of KU117 at 23:45 LT. The pushback driver continued forward as he did not feel the impact and made a left turn onto taxiway H, then right turn into Hardstand 73.   Substantial damage to the tail of KU117, including the right and left horizontal stabilizer, elevator, tail cone and APU.

On the second attempt for landing, a decision was made to switch to runway 33 and while on final approach to runway 33, visual contact was lost again and a second go-around was executed. On the third attempt the pilot landed on runway 33, but seconds after touchdown there was a collapse of the left main landing gear which subsequently led to a runway excursion taking place. Investigators noticed that the landing gear selector switch was located in the ""UP"" position. Consultation with the operator's maintenance personnel and the aircraft manufacturer has determined, based on the systems operation, that if the landing gear switch is placed in the ""UP"" position and the gear contact micro-switch on either landing gear is contaminated with dirt, water or other contaminants, or if the switch is shorted out for whatever reason, it is possible that the gear may not retract when commanded by the selection of the gear switch. In this instance, it is possible that the gear position lights may still indicate ""3-green lights"" (which normally indicates the gear as being ""down and locked"") despite the gear selector handle being selected to the ""UP"" position. However, once you land or the contaminant is removed or the ""system short"" is corrected, or no longer exists, there is a possibility that the gear could collapse (if the gear selector switch is in the ""UP"" position, as was the case). The AAID believes this to be the case, as no mechanical irregularities have been found or could be replicated that would otherwise explain why the gear collapsed.  The AAID also investigated the licensing and record keeping regarding the flight crew. It appeared that the captain of the flight initially had a US FAA license. During his stay in the US, he was convicted and incarcerated for controlled substance violations. As a consequence his FAA commercial pilot license was revoked for life on 11 August 2009. After returning to the Bahamas, he applied for an Airman License Validation based on a (revoked!) Foreign License in June 2011. It is unclear if he received this validation at that time. He was issued a commercial pilot license in May 2013, which was renewed in 2015 and valid until August 2020. The AAID found that no duty time, flight time or sectors were recorded for the captain between a proficiency check was completed on March 2013 and January 9, 2018 (date of the accident).  It also appeared that the Nassau-Lynden Pindling International Airport refused to issue an ID badge to the captain for unescorted access to the restricted airside, citing his US criminal record. Nevertheless he subsequently obtained an ID badge issued by the Grand Bahama Airport Company in Freeport, Grand Bahama. This was not valid for Nassau Airport, yet he managed to gain airside at Nassau without any problems. The AAID attributes this accident to ""pilot error."" The poor decision making exercised by the crew in attempting several landings in severe weather has been determined as the probable cause of the accident. Also contributing to this accident was the actions of the crew where, after 2 failed landing attempts and executing 2 go around maneuvers, they failed to realize the landing gear selector handle was selected in the ""UP"" position when the aircraft was configured for the 3rd landing. The situation was further exacerbated by additional human factor errors such as operating under periods of high stress, departing after such long delays, operating in severe weather, and flying at night- all factors experienced by the crew, which are contributory in this accident. Crew training, qualification, and authorization has been investigated and found questionable and also may have contributed to the accident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAID Bahamas Report number: AO-18-000002 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Local Airline Crash Lands - All Passengers Safe (eleutheranews.com, 10 Jan 2018) History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  24 June 2020 C6-MIC Pineapple Air 0 North Eleuthera International Airport (MYEH) min Tire failure 23 February 2024 C6-MIC Pineapple Air 0 Nassau-Lynden Pindling International Airport (NAS/MYNN) non Engine failure Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

During climb after takeoff from KrakÃ³w Airport, the nose landing gear (NLG) did not retract after moving the landing gear control lever to the UP position. Amber light N DOOR (nose door open), red light NOSE (nose gear not uplocked or downlocked) and red light on the landing gear control lever (gear in transit) illuminated. The CPT decided to continue the flight to the destination (EPWA). During the landing approach to EPWA, the crew extended the landing gear with the alternate system. The main landing gear (MLG) was extended and locked, but the NLG did not change its position. The crew made an emergency landing on EPWA RWY11 with NLG in the transit position, which was folded during the landing roll. When the plane came to rest on runway 11, the passengers were evacuated. All passengers and crew left the plane uninjured. The plane was damaged to an extent that required repair. Cause of the accident The immediate cause of the accident was excessive free play in the retraction/extension system of the nose landing gear. Contributing factors 1. Lack of procedures to measure and monitor the free play in the nose landing gear retraction/extension system during the Time Between Overhaul (30 000 Cycles or 14 years). 2. Lack of analysis of three-point landings which resulted in overload of NLG. 3. Lack of dedicated technological cards to verify possible damage caused by unusual events, such as hitting the drawbar connected to the airplane by a tug.

The flight departed Cox's Bazar Airport at 10:53 hours local time and landed on runway 34 at Jessore Airport at 12:03. After clearing the runway via Romeo while taxying into and following the eastern taxy yellow guide line for parking into the BAY-1 at Jessore apron, the captain noticed four amber caution lights illuminate on the hydraulic panel. Subsequently, the captain noticed he lost the response of nose wheel steering. Upon application of brakes, there was no response. Soon after the captain and co-pilot checked and found hydraulic quantity reduced with zero pressure. The aircraft veered to the left and went out of the concrete apron into the soft ground. This resulted the left main wheel  striking a concrete slab causing the affected wheel to bend rearward and collapse. The left engine propeller struck the ground.  As per the captain and first officer, at that time, both tried to build-up hydraulic pressure with the hand pump but to no avail.4. According to the captain, he carried out a visual inspection and observed that the hydraulic reservoir installed in right hand engine was completely depleted. CAUSES: Metal fatigue leading to the breakage and dislocation of the hydraulic fitting that gave rise to loss of hydraulic fluid resulting the loss of steering wheel control and braking during taxing of the aircraft. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS Human factor: Delay in detecting the four hydraulic failure lights, especially by the pilot monitoring, during the landing roll and early part of taxing into the apron owing to the conspicuous location of the lights when the pilotsÂ eyes usually remain outside the cockpit.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIG-BD Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Aircraft Accident Investigation Group of Bangladesh   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft operated on a flight from Lagos, where it departed at 14:28 hours local time. The captain was the Pilot Flying  and the co-pilot was the Pilot Monitoring. The departure, cruise and approach to Abuja Airport were uneventful. Although runway 04 was the active runway, the aircraft was cleared for radar vectors for a visual final approach to runway 22. The aircraft was cleared to land at 15:17 hours. The reported wind by the tower was 070Â°at 7 knots. At 15:18, the aircraft landed slightly left of the runway centre line. According to the crew the aircraft started skidding left to right. The crew further reported that, as the brakes were applied, they noticed the aircraft oscillating left and right. The oscillation increased continuously until eventually the aircraft finally swivelled on the right shoulder of the runway where it came to a complete stop on a Magnetic Heading of 160Â°. Skid marks indicated that the aircraft steered in an S-pattern with increasing amplitude down the runway. On the last right turn, the right main wheel went into the grass and on the final left pattern, the right main landing gear strut detached from its main attachment point. Causal Factor: The use of improper directional control techniques to maintain the aircraft on the runway. Contributory Factor: Improper coordination in taking over control of the aircraft by the PM which was inconsistent with Nestoil SOP.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIB Nigeria Report number: NESTOIL/2018/01/25/F Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Abuja airport reopened after jet mishap (thecable.ng, 25 Jan. 2018) History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  1 October 2013 LZ-EVL Alpha Air 0 Odessa International Airport non Runway excursion Location  Images: photo (c) AAIB Nigeria; Abuja International Airport (ABV); 25 January 2018 photo (c) AAIB Nigeria; Abuja International Airport (ABV); 25 January 2018 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Preflight planning had noted the destination airport's runway conditions as ""good."" As the flight neared the destination airport and the crew conducted the approach checklist, the captain stated, ""light snow ... maybe slippery.""  When the crew checked the airportÂs automated terminal information service, the broadcast included ""light freezing rain."" The flight was transferred to the tower controller, who told the crew that the airport operations crew was on the runway about 20 minutes earlier and advised that it was starting to pick up traces of ice. The captain acknowledged the transmission and, after conducting a missed approach to runway 6L, requested to land on runway 24R. During the approach to runway 24R, the tower controller reported wind at 020Â° at 25 knots and also at 010Â° at 25 knots.  The crewmembers reported that, after touchdown, they applied maximum braking; however, the airplane did not slow and skidded off the end of the runway into the engineered material arresting system (EMAS), which resulted in substantial damage to the fuselage and a collapsed nose gear.Â  The crew stated that the runway grooves had been ""smoothed out"" by ice accumulations. A first responder reported that the ramp and taxiways were very icy, adding that the end of the runway and EMAS had a sheet of ice. A review of the airport's snow and ice control plan noted that the airport did not have pavement surface sensors and that operations personnel would monitor the airfield as conditions dictated. An airport operations log entry for a runway and field inspection, recorded about 24 minutes before the accident, noted a temperature of 31Â°F and a braking coefficient of 40 , with runways and taxiways wet. A log entry for a runway and field inspection recorded about 6 minutes after the accident noted a braking coefficient of 30-35, with runways and taxiways wet. The Runway Condition Assessment Matrix contained in Advisory Circular 150/5200-30D states that a braking coefficient of 40 or higher is the equivalent of a pilot-reported braking action of ""good,"" while a braking coefficient of 30-35 would be medium to poor. The field conditions noted during the pilotsÂ preflight planning indicated ""good"" braking conditions; however, the captain's statement of ""light snow ... maybe slippery,"" along with the tower controller's report that the runway was starting to pick up traces of ice, indicated that the crew was aware of the potential for braking conditions that were less than good, which would decrease braking action and increase the stopping distance. Further, the crewÂs selection of runway 24R, which led to the presence of a tailwind, also would decrease braking action. Probable Cause: The airplane's reduced braking performance due to an ice-covered runway, which resulted in a runway excursion. Contributing to the accident was the crew's selection of a runway with a tailwind.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All 65 passengers and 6 crew members were killed. The aircraft took off from runway 14R at Moscow's Domodedovo Airport at 14:21 hours local time (11:21 UTC). Weather about the time of departure at Domodedovo Airport included limited visibility (2100m) during light snowfall. Temperature was -5Â°C, overcast cloud deck at 2600 feet AGL. The Interstate Aviation Committee stated that, prior to departure, the heating of the three pitot tubes had not been turned on.  After takeoff, at an altitude of 130-150 m (425-490 ft) above ground level, the autopilot was switched on. Flaps were raised as the aircraft climbed through an altitude of 550 m (1800 feet). About 2 minutes 30 seconds after the takeoff, at an altitude of about 1300 meters (4265 feet) and an instrument speed of 465-470 km/h, there were discrepancies between the air speed readings on the captain's side compared to the standby airspeed indicator. The airspeed on the copilot's side is unknown as this parameter was not registered by the flight data recorder. There were no significant difference in the altitude indications. After another 25 seconds, the discrepancies reached about 30 km/h with the speed on the captain's side being greater. After about 50 seconds, at an altitude of about 2000 meters (6560 ft), the airspeed on the standby airspeed indicator was higher and continued to increase while the airspeed on the captains ASI continued to decrease. The flight crew then disconnected the autopilot. The airspeed on the captain's side continued to decrease, while the standby ASI showed 540-560 km/h. About 50 seconds after the autopilot was turned off, the flight passed an altitude of 1700-1900 m (5580-6230 ft) with vertical loads ranging from 1.5 to 0.5 g. Subsequently the aircraft entered a steep descent with the ASI on the captain's side showing 0 km/h, and the standby ASI showing 200 km/h. The pitch angle decreased to -30/-35 degrees with a vertical load factor of  0 g. The aircraft impacted a snowy field around 14:27:05 and disintegrated. Before the collision with the ground, the standby ASI had increased to 800 km/h with the captain's ASI still displaying 0 km/h. The captain of the An-148 had 2168 hours on type, of which 58 as captain. The first officer had 672 hours on type. The AN-148-100V RA-61704 crash occurred due to erroneous actions of the crew at the stage of climbing in instrument weather conditions at unreliable readings of instrument speed caused by icing (blockage of ice) of all three pitot tubes, which led to the loss of control over the parameters of the aircraft, its transfer to dive and collision with the ground. The accident was classified as a loss of control in flight (LOC-I). The investigation revealed systemic weaknesses in the identification of hazards and risk control, the inoperability of the airline's flight safety management system and the lack of control over the level of training of crew members by aviation authorities at all levels, which led to the issuance of certificates of aviation personnel and the admission to the flights of the crew, which did not fully meet the qualification requirements. The most likely contributing factors were: - Hurry of the crew in preparation for the flight due to the late arrival of the aircraft from the previous flight and attempts to ""catch up"" with the time; - Skipping by the crew of the operation to switch on the pitot tube heating before takeoff and failing to comply with the section of the check list ""BEFORE TAKE-OFF"", which provides for the control of this action; - design features of the An-148 aircraft in terms of the restrictions on the duration of pitot tube heating operation on the ground, which led to the need to carry out operations to control the inclusion of pitot tube heating and compliance with the principle of ""dark cockpit"" in a separate section of the ""BEFORE THE FLIGHT"" check list, which is performed immediately before the start of the takeoff run, which creates additional risks of missing these operations. These actions are provided in the section ""ON THE RUNWAY START""; - systematic failure of the airline's crews to comply with the ""dark cockpit"" principle and the requirements of the radar, which contributed to ""getting used"" to the takeoff with the presence of emergency and warning messages on the Integrated system and alarm indicator (KISS) and did not allow to identify the fact that the pitot tube heating was not included. In the accident flight before takeoff, six warning messages were displayed on the KISS, including three messages about the absence of pitot tube heating; - design features of the An-148 aircraft, connected with the impossibility to disable the display of a number of warning messages on the KISS even when performing the whole range of works provided for by the MMEL while ensuring the flight with delayed defects; - low safety culture in the airline, which was manifested in: systematic failure to record in the flight log the failures detected during the flight, as well as in the performance of flights with the failures not eliminated and/or not included in the list of delayed failures, accompanied by the corresponding messages on the KISS; - Failure to take necessary measures in case of detection of previous facts of untimely activation of pitot tube heating by crews based on the results of express analysis of flight information; - Unreadiness of the crew to take actions in case of triggering the alarm ""Speed of Emergency"" due to the lack of appropriate theoretical training in the airline and the impossibility to work out this special situation on the flight simulation device and / or during airfield training and, as a consequence, failure to comply with the procedures provided for after triggering of this alarm; - Absence of federal aviation regulations for certification of flight simulators, the development of which is provided for by the Air Code of the Russian Federation; - Approval for the existing AN-148 flight simulators of the IFC Training LLC and the CTC of the Saint-Petersburg State University of Civil Aviation without taking into account their actual capabilities to reproduce special flight cases, as well as the provisions of FAR-128; - Absence of specific values of flight parameters (engine operation mode, pitch and roll angles, etc.) in the aircraft's flight maMETAR: 10:30 UTC / 13:30 local time: UUDD 111030Z 14005MPS 2500 R14R/1800U R14L/P2000D -SHSN BKN007 BKN026CB M05/M06 Q1019 R14R/590293 R14L/590392 TEMPO 1000 SHSN11:00 UTC / 14:00 local time: UUDD 111100Z 14006MPS 1800 R14R/1900U R14L/1800U SHSN BKN007 BKN026CB M05/M06 Q1019 R14R/590293 R14L/590392 NOSIG11:30 UTC / 14:30 local time: UUDD 111130Z 13006MPS 2100 -SN SCT008 OVC026 M05/M06 Q1019 R14R/590293 R14L/590392 TEMPO 1200 SHSN BKN012CB12:00 UTC / 15:00 local time: UUDD 111200Z 13005MPS 1900 R14R/2000D R14L/1900D SN SCT007 OVC026 M05/M06 Q1019 R14R/590293 R14L/590491 TEMPO 1200 SHSN BKN012CBAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: RT.com  Flightradar24 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  28 July 2013 RA-61704 Rossiya 0 Saint Petersburg-Pulkovo Airport (LED/ULLI) min Engine failure 23 August 2013 RA-61704 Rossiya 0 Saint Petersburg-Pulkovo Airport (LED/ULLI) min Location  Images: photo (c) MAK; Moskva-Domodedovo Airport (DME/UUDD); 11 February 2018 photo (c) Flightradar24; Moskva-Domodedovo Airport (DME/UUDD); 11 February 2018 photo (c) ASN; Moskva-Domodedovo Airport (DME/UUDD); 11 February 2018 photo (c) MAK; Moskva-Domodedovo Airport (DME/UUDD); February 2018 photo (c) MAK; Moskva-Domodedovo Airport (DME/UUDD); February 2018 photo (c) MAK; Moskva-Domodedovo Airport (DME/UUDD); February 2018 photo (c) Papas Dos; Moskva-Domodedovo Airport (DME/UUDD); 06 May 2017; (CC:by) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft, an Airbus A330-223, took off from runway 18R at 22:52 hours. When the aircraft was climbing out of 1700ft AMSL, the no. 1 engine fire warning came ON. A few seconds later, the crew declared an emergency and requested an immediate return which was approved by ATC. The aircraft landed at about 22:59 and stopped on runway 18R. The Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting Services (ARFFS) reported observing fire on engine no.1 and extinguished it. Passengers were evacuated using the emergency slides on the right side of the aircraft. One passenger sustained serious injuries while 11 suffered minor injuries. Causal Factor An overtemperature condition and localized fire within the No. 1 engine cowling triggered a fire warning. The overtemperature and fire were caused by the ignition of fuel from a hairline crack on the fuel manifold supplying fuel nozzle 1. Contributory factor The fuel manifold cracking can be attributed to high vibratory stresses due to coupling of an acoustic combustor mode and a fuel manifold structural mode. Note: AIB Nigeria rated the occurence a 'Serious Incident'. However, as per ICAO Annex 13, this event was an Accident as one occupant had suffered serious injuries.

All on board were killed. The flight departed Mehrabad Airport at 08:05 hours local time and climbed to the cruising altitude of FL210. At 09:22 the aircraft was over the Isfahan (IFN) VOR. The flight requested permission to descend from FL210 to FL170. This was approved by Tehran ACC. The flight followed Airway W114 from the OBTUX navaid to the Yasuj DVOR/DME. Minimum altitude on that airway is FL170. Minimum safe altitude (MSA) over the sector close to Yasuj Airport is 15500 feet. Weather reported to the crew indicated a cloud ceiling of 15000 feet. Despite their clearance for FL170 and the MSA in the area, the crew subsequently selected FL150 as their target altitude.  The flight levelled off at FL150 at 09:28 hours and the de-ice & anti-ice systems were switched on. Subsequently the flight crew selected the autopilot's altitude mode to FL150. The aircraft then entered a mountain wave with vertical (updraft) winds reaching up to 3000 ft/min with associated icing conditions. Since the autopilot attempted to maintain FL150, engine power reduced to flight idle and the aircraft pitched down -4Â°. In these conditions the speed gradually reduced from a Calibrated Airspeed (CAS) of 205 knots. At 09:29:44 the flight crew switched off the de-ice & anti-ice systems. The aircraft then entered a mountain wave downdraft. Engine powered increased and the nose pitched up because the autopilot was attempting to get back to FL150. The CAS meanwhile dropped to 130 knots. The pilot then selected FL140 on the autopilot as the airspeed dropped to 118 knots. The stall warning sounded and the autopilot disconnected automatically. Airspeed increased to 134 knots as the aircraft descended at a rate of -3200 ft/m. At 09:31:22 the flight crew re-engaged the autopilot and set FL150 as their target altitude. Four seconds later the aircraft became close to the surrounding mountainous terrain and the EGPWS alarm sounded. Radio altitude at that point was 3643 feet (pressure altitude 13869 ft). The autopilot was disengaged again as the aircraft continued to lose altitude. Unable to regain altitude the flight crew noticed the mountain side ahead rolled the plane -86Â° to the left. The nose pitched up and the aircraft impacted the side of a mountain at 09:31:41. The wreckage was located the following day in the snow, 350 feet below the top of a 13,412 ft high mountain. Probable causes (from final report): The main cause of accident: The accident was happened due to many chains of considered causes but the 'Human Factor' had main role for the conclusion of the scenario. The Cockpit Crew action which has caused dangerous conditions for the flight is considered as main cause. Based on provided evidences, the errors of cockpit crew were as follows: - Continuing to the Yasouj airport for landing against Operation manual of the Company, due to low altitude ceiling of the cloud and related cloud mass. They should divert to alternate airport. - Descending to unauthorized altitude below minimum of the route and MSA - Lack of enough CRM during flight - Failure to complete the stall recovery (flap setting, max RPM). - Inappropriate use of Autopilot after Stall condition - Inadequate anticipation for bad weather based on OM (Clouds, Turbulence, and Icing ...) - Quick action to switch off anti-ice system and AOA - Failure to follow the Check lists and standard call out by both pilots Contributing Factors: The contributive factors to this accident include but are not limited to the following: - the airline was not capable to detect systematic defectives about : - effectiveness of crew training about Meteorology, OM, SOP, ... - enough operational supervision on pilot behaviors - The lack of SIGMET about Mountain Wave or Severe Mountain wave - Unclear procedure for stall recovery in FCOM - Lack of warning in aircraft manuals by manufacturer for flight crew awareness about mountain wave. - Lack of APM System to alert crew about performance degradationMETAR: 05:30 UTC / 09:00 local time: OISY 180530Z 09004KT 9999 FEW035CB SCT040 OVC090 14/M01 Q102206:00 UTC / 09:30 local time: OISY 180600Z 13004KT 9999 FEW035CB SCT040 OVC090 13/M00 Q102106:30 UTC / 10:00 local time: OISY 180630Z 14006KT 9999 FEW035CB SCT040 OVC090 15/M02 Q1021Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Iran Report number: A13961129EPATS Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: PressTV  Mehr News   Location  Images: photo (c) aerospacetalk.ir; near Yasuj Airport (YES/OISY); 20 February 2018 photo (c) aerospacetalk.ir; near Yasuj Airport (YES/OISY); 20 February 2018 photo (c) Google Earth / ASN annotations; near Yasuj Airport (YES/OISY); 18 February 2018 photo (c) CAO Iran / ASN annotations; near Yasuj Airport (YES/OISY); 18 February 2018 photo (c) CAO Iran; near Yasuj Airport (YES/OISY); 18 February 2018 photo (c) CAO Iran; near Yasuj Airport (YES/OISY); 18 February 2018 photo (c) Aeroprints.com; Dubai Airport (DXB/OMDB); 01 October 2006; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates03-Jan-2025 14:42 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The first officer was the Pilot Flying (PF) while the captain was the Pilot Monitoring (PM). Following an uneventful en route part of the flight, the aircraft was issued descent clearances to FL220 and then further down to FL80. During descent, the PF briefed for the localizer approach to runway 21. Port Harcourt Approach then reported the presence of cumulonimbus (Cb) clouds along the approach path of runway 21, and requested flight 363 to report intentions. Dana 363 responded ""I will like to come closer then we take our decision I will advise"". Meanwhile, the Tower controller informed the Approach controller that the intensity of rain had increased to heavy rain. At 18:43 Arik Air 766 peformed a go around on the approach to runway 03 due to windshear.  At 18:45, Dana 363 was cleared for the LOC approach to runway 21. Shortly afterwards the captain took over control after realizing the Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) 2 was unserviceable. When the aircraft was 12 miles to touch down, the Approach controller instructed the flight to contact Tower. The crew was engaged in changing the frequencies on the navigation radio receivers since the VOR DME was not showing. An initial attempt by the PM to contact the Tower was not on the correct frequency, during which both Tower and Approach were trying to contact the aircraft. Approximately 1.5 minutes after the first attempt, contact with the Tower was established on the correct frequency. The captain then instructed the first officer to watch out for the runway. A few seconds after, the captain was heard yelling for wipers. After a while, the captain sighted the runway and instructed the first officer to report this to the Tower controller. Thirty-two seconds later, an aural warning ""Sink rate""! ""Sink rate""!! ""Sink rate""!!! ""Sink rate""!!!! came on. The aircraft descended through approach minimums (460 feet AGL), crossed the threshold and did a smooth touchdown on the runway at 7972 feet from the threshold in high winds of 360Â°/22 kt. The aircraft landed without obtaining landing clearance from the Tower controller. Landing Distance Available (LDA) for runway 21 was 9843 feet which left a remaining length of 1871 feet for the aircraft to stop. According to the captain, during landing roll, the brakes were applied while simultaneously deploying thrust reversers to maximum; all spoilers automatically deployed after the nose wheel touched the ground. The crew continued to apply brakes until maximum braking was commanded. The aircraft could not be stopped during brake application and the captain continued applying the brake pedals to maximum. The aircraft was on the centreline until it veered off left approximately 200 feet from the end of the runway, exited the paved surface and came to a stop 978 feet from the end of the runway After the aircraft came to a complete stop, engines were shut down and emergency power switch was turned ON. The emergency light came ON, all other lights were OFF and the Public Address System was not working, the lead crew had to open the cockpit door to obtain emergency evacuation instructions from the captain. Emergency evacuation was carried out using only the left forward main door and the escape slide on this door did not deploy. All persons on board were evacuated unhurt. Causal factor: The accident was caused by an underestimation of the degradation of weather conditions (heavy rain, visibility and strong wind on short final and landing) and the failure by the crew to initiate a missed approach which was not consistent with the companyÂs SOP. Contributory Factors: Other contributing factors to this accident were: - Non-compliance to companyÂs SOP in meeting crew competency and complement requirements. - Ineffective two-way communication between the ATC and DAN0363 during final approach prevented the flow of technical information on runway surface condition and other relevant meteorological information essential to safety. - Failure of the crew to crosscheck the prevailing wind and also to obtain landing clearance from the ATC during final approach after contact with ATC was restored.METAR: 19:00 UTC / 20:00 local time: METAR DNPO 201900Z 24013KT 1500 TSRA BKN006 FEW018CB 22/21 Q1006 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIB Nigeria Report number: DANA/2018/02/20/F Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: AIB Nigeria   Location  Images: photo (c) AIB Nigeria; Port Harcourt Airport (PHC); 21 February 2018 photo (c) AIB Nigeria; Port Harcourt Airport (PHC); 21 February 2018 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Weather conditions at Abbotsford at the time of departure consisted of a temperature of -2Â°C in moderate to heavy snowfall with winds of approximately 10 knots. Prior to the departure, the fuel tanks were filled to capacity and the pilot and passengers boarded the aircraft inside the operator's heated hangar. The aircraft was towed outside of the hangar without being treated with anti-ice fluid, and taxied for the departure on runway 07. Due to an inbound arrival at Abbotsford, C-GIAE was delayed for departure. Once cleared for takeoff, the aircraft had been exposed to snow and freezing conditions for approximately 13 minutes.  Approximately 4 to 5 seconds after takeoff, the pilot selected the landing gear control to the up position. As the gear retracted, the aircraft rolled approximately 30Â° to the left. To correct the uncommanded left bank, the pilot applied right aileron, and the aircraft returned to a near wings-level attitude. In order to make an immediate off-field emergency landing, the pilot retarded the power levers and then applied forward pressure on the control column to land the aircraft. The aircraft struck terrain between runway 07 and taxiway C. The aircraft slid across the snow-covered ground for approximately 760 feet before coming to rest in a raspberry patch located on the airport property. Four passengers and the pilot sustained serious injuries as a result of the accident which destroyed the aircraft. Findings as to causes and contributing factors: 1. The occurrence aircraft exited a warm hangar and was exposed to 14 minutes of heavy snow in below-freezing conditions. This resulted in a condition highly conducive to severe ground icing. 2. As the aircraft climbed out of ground effect on takeoff, it experienced an aerodynamic stall as a result of wing contamination. 3. The pilot's decision making was affected by continuation bias, which resulted in the pilot attempting a takeoff with an aircraft contaminated with ice and snow adhering to its critical surfaces. 4. The pilot and the passenger seated in the right-hand crew seat were not wearing the available shoulder harnesses. As a result, they sustained serious head injuries during the impact sequence. 5. During the impact sequence, the cargo restraint system used to secure the baggage in the rear baggage compartment failed, causing some of the baggage to injure passengers seated in the rear of the aircraft cabin.METAR: 19:27 UTC / 11:27 local time: CYXX 231927Z 08003KT 5/8SM R07/4000FT/D SN OVC007 M02/M03 A3036 RMK SN5SC3 /S02/ SLP28520:00 UTC / 12:00 local time: CYXX 232000Z VRB02KT 3/8SM R07/3000V4500FT/D SN BKN006 OVC013 M02/M03 A3034 RMK SN5SF2NS1 /S03/ SLP28020:12 UTC / 12:12 local time: CYXX 232012Z 00000KT 3/8SM R07/3000FT/N SN BKN006 OVC013 M02/M03 A3034 RMK SN5SF2NS1 SLP27820:47 UTC / 12:47 local time: CYXX 232047Z 19008KT 1/2SM R07/3000V4500FT/N SN BKN006 OVC017 M02/M03 A3031 RMK SN4SF2NS2 SLP267Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A18P0031 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: TSB A18P0031   Location  Images: photo (c) TSB Canada; Abbotsford Airport, BC (YXX); 24 February 2018 photo (c) TSB Canada; Abbotsford Airport, BC (YXX); 24 February 2018 photo (c) Transport Canada; Abbotsford Airport, BC (YXX); 23 February 2018 photo (c) TSB Canada; Abbotsford Airport, BC (YXX); 23 February 2018 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The charter flight touched down at Sept-Ãles (CYZV) at 08:36 and took off again for the third flight leg at 1049, bound for Havre-Saint-Pierre (CYGV). The aircraft conducted an approach to runway 08, which was snow-covered, while visibility was reduced due to heavy snow showers, and landed approximately 3800 feet beyond the threshold, at approximately 700 feet from the end of the runway. It continued its landing roll beyond the runway until it came to rest in a snowbank, approximately 220 feet beyond the end of the runway. The aircraft sustained substantial damage. Four of the occupants received minor injuries. Findings as to causes and contributing factors - The captain continued the approach beyond the final approach fix when the reported visibility was below the approach ban minima. - During the approach, runway lighting was reduced to medium intensity, which was 30% of maximum strength, thereby reducing the probability of seeing the visual references required to conduct the landing on the runway. - The captain proceeded with the landing sequence, without seeing or knowing the length of the remaining runway ahead and unable to accurately assess the aircraftÂs position. - The aircraft landed approximately 3800 feet past the threshold, 700 feet from the end of the runway, and stopped its landing roll in a snowbank, 220 feet beyond the runway. - The deviation from standard operating procedures at a critical moment of flight was a source of confusion between the flight crew members, to the point where the aircraft was not configured for a landing, which increased the landing distance required. - The captain, focused on the landing manoeuvre and experiencing narrowed attention, was unable to make the decision to conduct a go-around. He lost the notion of time and flew over the runway for 20 seconds, not realizing that it was now impossible to touch down and come to a stop before the end of the runway. - Without policies, clear procedures and training, the first officer did not have the tools necessary to shift from a passive advisory role to proactive assertiveness strong enough to convince the captain to conduct a go-around. - The approach ban was ineffective in preventing this approach while visibility on the ground was below the minimum required for an approach ban.METAR: 15:19 UTC / 10:19 local time: CYGV 261519Z AUTO 18010G15KT 1 3/4SM -SN OVC009 M03/M04 A2985 RMK SLP11216:09 UTC / 11:09 local time: CYGV 261609Z AUTO 16004KT 1/4SM +SN VV004 M03/M03 A2984 RMK SLP10817:20 UTC / 12:20 local time: CYGV 261720Z AUTO 15004KT 1SM -SN OVC009 M02/M03 A2980 RMK SLP096Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A18Q0030 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: TSB A18Q0030   Location  Images: photo (c) TSB Canada; Havre-Saint-Pierre Airport, QC (YGV); 26 February 2018; (CC:by-nc-nd) photo (c) TSB Canada; Havre-Saint-Pierre Airport, QC (YGV); 26 February 2018; (CC:by-nc-nd) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

At 12:03 hours local time the aircraft departed Tallinn as crew training flight MYX9001. Onboard were a captain-instructor as well as a second pilot, four students and a Civil Aviation Administration inspector.  Numerous circuits and touch-and-goes were performed, including two full stop landings.  During final approach to runway 08 at 17:04, the aircraft stopped responding to flight control inputs. Altitude was lost and the aircraft hit the runway. The engines touched the runway and the main landing gear doors broke.  The aircraft then managed to gain altitude and the pilots were able to stabilize the aircraft and turn back. Both engines, however, lost power after the turn back to the airport. An emergency landing was carried out at 17:11, about 150 meters from the runway. The aircraft came to a halt in the snow 15 meters south of the runway. The flight crew members evacuated the aircraft via the L1 door emergency escape slides.  A video of the incident shows what appears to be a tire rolling away from the aircraft as it came to a stop. Photos from the scene seem to show that one of the nose landing gear tires is missing. Photos also indicate that the ram air turbine (RAT) had been deployed. Causal factors: This accident results from the combination of the following factors: - The intermittent THSA override mechanism malfunction allowing to cause the loss of pitch control by both ELACs. The repetitive triggering of the ELAC PITCH faults was caused by the non or late activations of the PTA micro-switches, which were due to the OVM piston insufficient stroke. The insufficient OVM stroke was caused by the THSA OVM clutch unit non-standard friction. The oil in the THSA OVM casing appeared to be with a higher viscosity than defined in the CMM. The higher viscosity might have reduced the friction of the OVM clutch unit, causing the THSA OVM nonstandard friction. - SEC design flaw allowing for a single event, the left landing gear temporary dedecompression, to cause the loss of pitch control by both SECs. The absence of ground spoilers arming for landing in the context of touch and go's training may have contributed to the temporary decompression of the left main landing gear. - The training instructor`s decision for continuation of the flight despite repetitive ELAC PITCH FAULT ECAM caution messages.  The lack of clear framework of operational rules for training flights, especially concerning the application of the MEL, and the specific nature of operations that caused pressure to complete the training program may have impacted the crew decision-making process. Contributory factors - Smartlynx Estonia ATO TM does not clearly define the need for arming spoilers when performing touch-and-go training (ATO procedures not in accordance with Airbus SOP). The fact that there is no clear reference in the Smartlynx Estonia ATO TM Touch-And-Go air exercise section to additional procedures that should be used, in combination with lack of understanding of the importance for arming the spoilers during this type of flights contributed to TRI making a decision to disarm the spoilers during touch and go training enabling landing gear bounce on touch down. - At the time of the event Airbus QRH did not define the maximum allowed number of resets for the flight control computers. - At the time of the event Airbus FCTM did not require to consider MEL on touch-and-go and stop-and-go training. - The oil in the THS OVM casing was with higher viscosity than defined in the CMM. The higher viscosity might have reduced the friction of the OVM clutch unit. - The aircraft maintenance documentation does not require any test of the OVM during aircraft regular maintenance checks. - Smartlynx Estonia ATO OM does not clearly specify the role in the cockpit for the Safety Pilot. The lack of task sharing during the event caused the ECAM warnings to be left unnoticed and unannounced for a long period. - The crew not resetting the ELAC 1. The fact that ELAC 1 PITCH FAULT was left unreset lead to the degradation of the redundancy of the system. Considering the remoteness of the loss control of both elevators, there is no specific crew training for MECHANICAL BACKUP in pitch during approach, landing and take-off. This condition of the aircraft occurred for the crew in a sudden manner on rotation and during training flight, where the experienced TRI is not in PF role and cannot get immediate feedback of the aircraft behaviour and condition. Despite these difficult conditions the crew managed to stabilize and land the aircraft with no major damage to the persons on board. The crew performance factors that contributed to the safe landing of the aircraft are the following: - The TRI followed the golden rule of airmanship (fly, navigate, communicate), by stabilizing the aircraft pitch by using the trim wheel and by keeping the aircraft engine power as long as possible; - The Safety Pilot started to play a role in the cockpit by assisting the TRI and student by informing them about the status of the aircraft and later on taking the role of the PM.METAR: 14:20 UTC / 16:20 local time: EETN 281420Z 07011KT 3700 SHSN DRSN SCT009 SCT013CB M12/M15 Q1043 R08/810295 NOSIG14:50 UTC / 16:50 local time: EETN 281450Z 07013KT 9000 -SHSN DRSN FEW008 BKN013 FEW015CB M13/M15 Q1043 R08/810295 NOSIG 15:20 UTC / 17:20 local time: EETN 281520Z 07012KT 9999 -SHSN DRSN FEW008 BKN013 FEW015CB M13/M15 Q1043 R08/490195 NOSIG 15:50 UTC / 17:50 local time: EETN 281550Z 09011KT 9999 -SN DRSN OVC013 M13/M15 Q1042 R08/490195 NOSIG 16:20 UTC / 18:20 local time: EETN 281620Z 09010KT 9999 -SN OVC014 M14/M16 Q1042 R08/490195 NOSIG Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ESIB Report number: A2802118 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: lentoposti.fi  delfi.lv  Plane to make emergency landing in Tallinn landed with stopped engines (news.err.ee, 14 March 2018)   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Congo. The aircraft departed Kinshasa-N'Djili Airport on a cargo flight to Lubumbashi. A training captain was seated on the right and the trainee captain on the left seat. The third pilot had the role of safety pilot. The trainee captain was on his fifth line training flight. At Lubumbashi, the crew was cleared for an instrument landing procedure for runway 07. In the pre-landing briefing, AUTO BRAKE 2 mode was selected for deceleration of the aircraft. No anomalies or technical malfunctions were reported to ATC. The weather conditions were good with calm winds. On landing, the aircraft landed in the touchdown zone according to the crew, the rollout on the runway appeared normal, and deceleration was progressive. At about 80 knots, the crew noted that the aircraft was diverging to the left of the runway centreline. The crew immediately switched to manual braking, but to no avail, the aircraft continued the skid until it went off the runway and came to a stop, leaving the right main gear on the runway. The nose landing gear, passing over the less compact shoulder, became bogged down and then broke off. The left main landing gear, with the weight of the aircraft, also dug in so that the left engine touched the ground. The aircraft sustained substantial damage in the area of the nose landing gear cage (wheel well). Contributing facts: (a) Reduction of simulator training hours for economic reasons for someone who has never performed the duties of controlling an aircraft on the ground. (b) The runway shoulders at Lubumbashi (Luano) do not have the same characteristics with regard to strength (see Annex 14 and Document 9157 Part 3). In conclusion, the actions taken on the rudder before it became ineffective must have been the cause of the aircraft's deviation from the runway centreline and the loss of control of the aircraft (LOC-G).Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BPEA Report number: BPEA/ACCID 01/2018 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Times.cd   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft departed Sharjah, UAE at 13:11 UTC on a flight to Istanbul, Turkey. The aircraft entered Tehran FIR fifteen minutes later and the Tehran ACC controller cleared the flight to climb to FL360 according to its flight plan. About 14:32, the pilot requested FL380, which was approved. Before reaching that altitude, the left and right airspeeds began to diverge by more than 10 knots. The left (captain's) airspeed indicator showed an increase while the right hand (copilot's) airspeed indicator showed a decrease. A caution aural alert notified the flight crew of the difference. Remarks by the flight crew suggested that an 'EFIS COMP MON' caution message appeared on the EICAS. As the aircraft was climbing, the crew reduced thrust to idle. Approximately 63 seconds later, while approaching FL380, the overspeed aural warning (clacker) began to sound, indicating that the indicated Mach had exceeded M 0.85. Based on the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) of the aircraft, the pilot flying should validate the IAS based on the aircraft flight manual and define the reliable Air Data Computer (ADC) and select the reliable Air Data source. The pilot did not follow this procedure and directly reduced engine power to decrease the IAS after hearing the clacker. The actual airspeed thus reached a stall condition. The copilot tried to begin reading of the 'EFIS COMP MON' abnormal procedure for three times but due to pilot interruption, she could not complete it. Due to decreasing speed, the stall aural warning began to sound, in addition to stick shaker and stick pusher activating repeatedly. The crew then should have referred to another emergency procedure to recover from the stall condition. While the stick pusher acted to pitch down the aircraft to prevent a stall condition, the captain was mistakenly assumed an overspeed situation due to the previous erroneous overspeed warning and pulled on the control column. The aircraft entered a series of pitch and roll oscillations. The autopilot was disengaged by the crew before stall warning, which ended the oscillations. Engine power began to decrease on both sides until both engines flamed out in a stall condition. From that point on FDR data was lost because the electric bus did not continue to receive power from the engine generators. The CVR recording continued for a further approximately 1 minute and 20 seconds on emergency battery power. Stall warnings, stick shaker and stick pusher activations continued until the end of the recording. The aircraft then impacted mountainous terrain. Unstable weather conditions were present along the flight route over Iran, which included moderate up to severe turbulence and icing conditions up to 45000ft. These conditions could have caused ice crystals to block the left-hand pitot tube. It was also reported that the aircraft was parked at Sharjah Airport for three days in dusty weather condition. Initially the pitot covers had not been applied. The formation of dust inside the pitot tube was considered another possibility. The Iranian investigators stated that both TSB Canada and Bombardier Inc. had some limitations to support the Iranian investigation team under U.S. and Canadian law against standard 4.6 of Annex 13 to ICAO convention. Main cause and contributing factors: The accident was caused by insufficient operational prerequisites for the management of erratic airspeed indication failure by the cockpit crew.  Contributing factors were: - The aircraft designer/manufacturer provided insufficient technical and operational guidance about airspeed malfunctions that previously occurred. - Lack of effective CRM.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Iran Report number: A961220TC-TRB Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources: Aerospacetalk.ir  Airporthaber   Location  Images: photo (c) flybyeigenheer; GenÃ¨ve-Cointrin Airport (GVA/LSGG); 08 February 2016; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) RenÃ© Verschuur; Istanbul-AtatÃ¼rk International Airport (IST/LTBA); 14 June 2013 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Prior to departure, while in radio contact with Dhaka Ground Control and the airline's Operations department, the captain shows signs that he was agitated and experiencing high levels of stress. As the aircraft was in a climb phase, the captain overheard a communication between Operations and another US-Bangla aircraft regarding the fuel onboard but the captain without verifying whether the message was meant for him or not, engaged in some unnecessary conversation with the Operations staff. The Captain's vocal pitch and language used again indicated that he was very much emotionally disturbed and experiencing high level of stress. The aircraft established its first contact with Kathmandu Control at 07:52 UTC. At 08:07 the First Officer contacted Kathmandu Control and requested descent clearance. Kathmandu Control cleared the flight to descend to FL160 with an estimated approach time of 08:26 which was acknowledged by the First Officer. At 08:10 the flight was handed over to Kathmandu Approach. At 08:11, Kathmandu Approach instructed the aircraft to descend to 13500 feet and hold over GURAS. The crew inserted the HOLD in the Flight Management System. At 08:13 Kathmandu Approach further instructed the aircraft to reduce its speed and descend to 12500 feet. Three minutes later a further descent clearance was given to 11500 feet, and the flight was cleared for a VOR approach to runway 02 maintaining minimum approach speed. Both crew members forgot to cancel the hold on the FMS as they were engaged in some unnecessary conversation. Upon reaching GURAS, the aircraft turned left to enter the holding pattern over GURAS, which was noticed by both crew members and immediately the captain made a correction. At the same time they were alerted by Approach Control. The captain immediately selected a heading of 027Â° which was just 5Â° of interception angle to intercept the desired radial of 202Â° inbound to KTM. The spot wind recorded was westerly at 28kt. The aircraft continued approach on heading mode and crossed radial 202Â° at 7 DME of KTM VOR. The aircraft then continued on the same heading of 027Â° and deviated to the right of the final approach course. Having deviated to the right of the final approach path, the aircraft reached about 2-3 NM North east of the KTM VOR and continued to fly further northeast. At 08:27, Kathmandu Tower (TWR) alerted the crew that the landing clearance was given for runway 02 but the aircraft was proceeding towards runway 20. At 08:29, Tower Controller asked the crew of their intention to which the captain replied that they would be landing on runway 02. The aircraft then made an orbit to the right. The Controller instructed the aircraft to join downwind for runway 02 and report when sighting another Buddha Air aircraft which was already on final for runway 02. The aircraft instead of joining downwind leg for runway 02, continued on the orbit to the right on a westerly heading towards Northwest of runway 20. The controller instructed the aircraft to remain clear of runway 20 and continue to hold at the present position as the Buddha Air aircraft was landing on runway 02 (from the opposite side) at that time. After the landing of the Buddha Air aircraft, the Tower Controller, at 08:32 UTC gave a choice to BS211 to land either on runway 20 or 02 but the aircraft again made an orbit to the right, this time northwest of runway 20. While continuing with the turn through a southeastern direction, the captain reported that he had the runway in sight and requested tower for clearance to land. The Tower Controller cleared the aircraft to land but when the aircraft was still turning for the runway it approached very close to the threshold of runway 20 on a westerly heading and not aligned with the runway. At 08:33:27 UTC, spotting the aircraft maneuvering at very close proximity to the ground and not aligned with the runway, the Tower Controller hurriedly cancelled the landing clearance of the aircraft by saying, ""Takeoff clearance cancelled"". Within the next 15-20 seconds, the aircraft pulled up in westerly direction and with very high bank angle turned left and flew over the western area of the domestic apron, continued on a southeasterly heading past the ATC Tower and further continued at a very low height, flew over the domestic southern apron area and finally attempted to align with the runway 20 to land. During this process, while the aircraft was turning inwards and momentarily headed towards the control tower, the tower controllers ducked down out of fear that the aircraft might hit the tower building. Missing the control tower, when the aircraft further turned towards the taxi track aiming for the runway through a right reversal turn, the tower controller made a transmission by saying, ""BS 211, I say again..."". At 08:34 UTC the aircraft touched down 1700 meters down the threshold with a bank angle of about 15 degrees and an angle of about 25 degrees with the runway axis (approximately heading Southeast) and to the left of the center line of runway 20, then veered southeast out of the runway through the inner perimeter fence along the rough down slope and finally stopped about 442 meters southeast from the first touchdown point on the runway. All four crew members (2 cockpit crew and 2 cabin crew) and 45 out of the 67 passengers onboard the aircraft were killed in the accident. Two more passengers succumbed to injury later in hospital during course of treatment. The aircraft caught fire after 6 seconds of touchdown which engulfed major portions of the aircraft. An investigation into the captain's behaviour showed that he had history of depression while serving in the Bangladesh Air Force in 1993 and was removed from active duty after evaluation by a psychiatrist. He was re-evaluated by a psychiatrist in January 2002 and was declared to be fit for flying. Examinations in successive annual medical checks were not focused on his previous medical condition of depression, possibly because this was not declared in the self-declaration form for annual medicals. During the flight the captain was irritable, tensed, moody, and aggressive at various times. He was smoking during the flight, contrary to company regulations. He also used foul language and abusive words in conversation with the junior female first officer. He was engaged in unnecessary conversation during the approach, at a time when sterile cockpit rules were in force. The captain seemed very unsecure about his future as he had submitted resignation from this company, though only verbally. He said he did not have any job and did not know what he was going to do for living. The Probable Causes: The Accident Investigation Commission determines that the probable cause of the accident is due to disorientation and a complete loss of situational awareness in the part of crewmember. Contributing to this the aircraft was offset to the proper approach path that led to maneuvers in a very dangerous and unsafe attitude to align with the runway. Landing was completed in a sheer desperation after sighting the runway, at very close proximity and very low altitude. There was no attempt made to carry out a go around, when a go around seemed possible until the last instant before touchdown on the runway. Contributing Factors: a. Improper timing of the pre-flight briefing and the commencement of the flight departure in which the operational pre-flight briefing was given in early morning but the flight departure time was around noon and there were four domestic short flights scheduled in between. b. The PIC, who was the pilot flying, seemed to be under stress due to behavior of a particular female colleague in the company and lack of sleep the preceding night. c. A very steep gradient between the crew. d. Flight crew not having practiced visual approach for runway 20 in the simulator. e. A poor CRM between the crew.METAR: 08:20 UTC / 14:05 local time: VNKT 120820Z 28008KT 240V320 6000 TS FEW015 FEW025CB SCT030 22/11 Q1015 NOSIG CB TO SE S AND SW08:50 UTC / 14:35 local time: VNKT 120850Z 26007KT 140V300 7000 FEW015 FEW025CB SCT030 BKN100 21/10 Q1015 NOSIG CB TO SE AND S Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Nepal AAIC Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: thehimalayantimes.com  nepalitimes.com  EXCLUSIVE: US-Bangla pilot was mentally stressed and reckless (kathmandupost.ekantipur.com, 27 August 2018) History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  4 September 2015 S2-AGU US-Bangla Airlines 0 Syedpur Airport (VGSD), Nilphamari min Runway excursion Location  Images: photo (c) Nepal AAIC; Kathmandu-Tribhuvan Airport (KTM); 12 March 2018 photo (c) Shadman Samee; Dhaka-Shahjalal International Airport (DAC/VGHS); 06 March 2018; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) Shadman Samee; Dhaka-Shahjalal International Airport (DAC/VGHS); February 2018; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) Ken Fielding; DÃ¼sseldorf International Airport (DUS/EDDL); 29 May 2010 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pedestrian sustained serious injuries, and the airplane sustained substantial damage. The captain, first officer, and the three passengers on board the airplane were not injured. The purpose of the flight was to provide logistical support of ICEX 2018, which involves, in part, U.S. Navy and U.K Royal Navy submarines operating beneath the frozen Arctic Ocean during a 5-week exercise. The flight used an airstrip on the sea ice that was lined on both sides with snow berms. The airstrip included one runway oriented north/south and an intersecting runway oriented east/west. Weather conditions at the time of the accident consisted of clear skies with ice pack haze. The sun was low on the horizon, resulting in shadows on the airstrip, and flat light conditions made it difficult to discern topographical features. The pedestrian reported that, just before the two pilots boarded the airplane, he told the captain that he would position himself alongside the airstrip so that he could photograph the airplane at departure. As the airplane back-taxied before takeoff, the pedestrian positioned himself clear of the airstrip and behind a 3- to 4-ft-tall snow berm. He said that, as the airplane's takeoff progressed, it did not climb as quickly as it had during previous departures and that the last thing he remembered before the collision was seeing the left wing getting lower to the ground as the airplane began a left turn and flew toward him while continuing to accelerate. A security video camera recorded the accident sequence, and the recording supported the pedestrian's account of the sequence of events. Although the captain reported that he climbed the airplane before initiating a left turn, the review of the video revealed that the flight crew operated the airplane at a low altitude and along a flightpath that placed it in dangerous proximity to the pedestrian (which was inconsistent with federal regulations) and left no margin to avoid the collision with him. A postaccident examination of the airplane revealed substantial damage to the left wing and left aileron. The pedestrian sustained a serious head and neck injuries because of the collision, and he was subsequently medevacked to Anchorage, Alaska for treatment. Probable Cause: The flight crew's improper decision to deliberately operate the airplane at low altitude and along a flightpath that resulted in a collision with a pedestrian after takeoff. Contributing to the accident was the pedestrian's proximity to the runway.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ANC18LA027 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Deadhorse, AK; March 2018 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft was performing Israir Airlines flight 6H716 from Budapest to Tel Aviv, Israel. During pushback the tow truck reportedly began emitting smoke, which supposedly entered the aircraft cabin. Cabin crew members opened the rear emergency exit(s) to allow evacuation through slides. During the evacuation, the rear slides were unstable because of the jet blast of the operating engines. Approximately 2.5 minutes passed from the opening of the slide to the shutdown of the engines. One passenger fell from the evacuation slide and suffered a serious head injury.  Causes In the course of its investigation, the IC concluded that the direct cause of the accident was the lack of communication from the cabin crew on duty in the aft galley to the rest of the crew, and identified the presence of the panic on board as an indirect cause, which was caused by the misjudgement of the origin of the smoke. In addition to those above, the IC presumes the following contributing factors: â passengersâ fatigue; â malfunction of the pushback tug; â ambiguity of the emergency procedures; â initiation of an evacuation without approval; â late reaction of the flight crew to the situation.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Hungary Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 years and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: http://airportal.hu/veszcsuszdakon-uritettek-ki-egy-repulogepet-ferihegyen/  https://mno.hu/belfold/sulyos-incidens-a-ferihegyen-2455450  http://www.kbsz.hu/j25/hu/legi-kozlekedes/kbsz-altal-vizsgalt-esemenyek-2014/22-legi-kozlekedes/legi-kozlekedes/2344-20180323 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  7 June 2009 D-AHLR Hapag-Lloyd 0 S of Aosta min Fumes/smoke/odor event 12 March 2013 OK-TVP Travel Service Airlines 0 Katowice Int'l Airport- KTW/EPKT, Pyrzowice non Runway excursion Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates23-Mar-2018 12:19 bbmaci Added 23-Mar-2018 12:26 harro Updated [Aircraft type, Cn, Operator, Location, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, ]23-Mar-2018 12:28 harro Updated [Embed code, ]02-May-2023 20:09 harro Updated 17-Jul-2023 08:05 harro Updated Corrections or additions? ...

The pilot reported that, after exiting instrument meteorological conditions during a circling approach, he was ""a little above"" the normal glidepath; as the airplane crossed the approach end of the runway, the airplane began to sink rapidly and drift to the left. He added power to initiate a go-around, but the airplane continued to sink and landed with the left main landing gear off the left side of the runway. As the airplane became airborne again, he attempted to retract the landing gear, ""but the handle was locked in place."" He noticed that the left and right main landing gear extension lights were illuminated, but the nose landing gear light was not. The pilot noticed a positive rate of climb and decided to fly to King Salmon Airport, Alaska. The pilot reported that, while en route to the alternate airport, a passenger reported that they smelled smoke, so he turned off electrical equipment. A pilot-rated passenger assisted with circuit breaker troubleshooting before turning on the battery again for communications. He instructed the pilot-rated passenger to visually examine the landing gear; the passenger reported that the left main landing gear was extended without damage and the right main landing gear was ""bent back,"" with damage to the right flap with fuel leaking from the wing.  After contacting the alternate airport's tower, the pilot reported that he declared an emergency and provided a safety brief to the passengers. He added that, at the alternate airport, he performed an instrument landing system approach, and over the approach end of the runway, he reduced power, feathered the propellers, and moved both fuel levers to fuel cutoff. During landing, the right main landing gear collapsed, the right wing settled onto the runway, and the airplane began to pull to the right. The pilot added left rudder to maintain the runway centerline and the airplane came to rest on the runway. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing. Probable Cause and Findings: The pilot's failure to maintain an adequate approach path and runway centerline during the initial landing, which resulted in a hard landing to the left of the runway and damage to the landing gear and wing.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: GAA18CA187 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  KTVA   Location  Images: photo (c) Alaska Department of Transportation; King Salmon Airport, AK (AKN/PAKN); 29 March 2018 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Arriving on final approach at the airport, the limited visibility prompted the crew to carry out a go-around and divert to Bamako. In the early afternoon, judging that the conditions were improving, the crew took off again and made it to the final approach on the laterite runway 07R of Gao.  With visibility reduced to 3,000 metres and the runway difficult to spot, the crew requested Gao air traffic control to mark the runway threshold with flashing lights. The crew only perceived this secondary runway late and made corrections to line up on the runway axis on short final. As a result, the approach was not stabilized. This unstable final approach resulted in a late and poorly controlled flare. The aircraft touched down on the runway and bounced back three times. One or more of these contacts with the runway produced excessive forces on the nose gear and its fracture. The aircraft slid over the front of the fuselage for 500 metres before coming to rest. The crew shut down the engines and systems, then evacuated the aircraft on their own. Causes of the event The causes of this event are environmental, organizational and human factors. The following factors contributed to the late detection of the active runway: - reduced visibility conditions due to haze (less than 3,000 metres); - the absence of contrast of the laterite runway with the surrounding terrain; - the lack of effectiveness of portable lighting installed at the runway threshold at the crew's request. The following factors contributed to an unstable final approach and a late and poorly controlled flare: - the focus of attention on the landing, leading to a poorly executed landing without a go-around; - operational pressure to deliver fresh food on time; - the emulation induced by the performance of another crew from the same company who may have landed earlier in Gao under the same conditions; - the fatigue accumulated by the sequence of flights and the weather conditions, which are conducive to errors of judgment and delays in decision-making; - the organisation of the cockpit not promoting synergy within the crew.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA-E Report number: E-2018-003-I Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The private pilot and passenger of the Cessna 150 sustained fatal injuries and the pilot and 4 passengers of the Cessna 525 were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed in the area. The Cessna 150 was departing on runway 15 at MZZ a local VFR personal flight and the Cessna 525 was landing on runway 22 after an IFR flight that originated from Jackson, Michigan, USA. Examination of the accident site showed that the Cessna 150 had struck the empennage of the Cessna 525 at the intersection of runways 15 and 22. Evidence at the intersection showed that the airplanes came together perpendicular to each other. The Cessna 150 then impacted the ground and a post-crash fire ensued. The Cessna 525 continued to roll out on runway 22.  Witnesses stated that they heard the Cessna 150 pilot on runway 15 UNICOM frequency. The surviving pilot of the Cessna 525 stated that he did not see the departing Cessna 150 while he was on a straight-in approach to runway 22, nor did he see the 150 during the landing roll. He stated that he did not recall making a radio call on UNICOM, but did utilize his on board Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) system while on approach. He stated that the TCAS did not show any traffic on the airport.  The reported weather at MZZ at the time of the accident was VFR with 4 miles of visibility due to haze. Also, at the departure and arrival ends of runway 15/33, there was a sign stating, ""Traffic Using Runway 4/22 Cannot Be Seen, Monitor Unicom 122.7."" At the departure and arrival ends of runway 4/22, there was a sign stating, ""Traffic Using 15/33 cannot Be Seen, Monitor Unicom 122.7."" The MZZ airport does not have a control tower. Probable Cause: The failure of both pilots to see and avoid the other airplane as they converged on intersecting runways. Contributing to the accident was the jet pilot's not monitoring the airport's traffic advisory frequency, known reduced visibility of the intersecting runways, and hazy weather condition.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN18FA132B Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources: theindychannel.com  WTHR   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Marion Municipal Airport, IN (MZZ); April 2018; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Marion Municipal Airport, IN (MZZ); April 2018; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Marion Municipal Airport, IN (MZZ); April 2018; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Marion Municipal Airport, IN (MZZ); April 2018; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Marion Municipal Airport, IN (MZZ); April 2018; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft skidded 278 m along the runway before it came to rest. The aircraft carried medical isotopes for a hospital. The crew was uninjured, while the aircraft suffered damage to the nose wheel mechanism, both propellers, belly and the trailing edge of the flaps. The crew explained that the landing gear collapsed when the aircraft landed. They experienced that the aircraft banked slightly to the left just after landing and the commander, who was PM (Pilot Monitoring), reacted by placing his hand on the landing gear handle to check if it was completely down. Furthermore, he explained that he retracted the handle in a reflex action, but quickly placed it down again. According to the crew, this led the landing gear to retract resulting in the aircraft taking the ground with its belly.  The NSIA has attempted to find a link between the crew's explanation and the investigation findings, but without finding a complete match. A thorough inspection of the landing gear was carried out after the accident without any significant technical issues located in the system. The NSIA believes that the landing gear was either in transit when they landed or that it was completely retracted, which resulted in a belly landing.METAR: 07:50 UTC / 09:50 local time: METAR ENZV 090750Z 17009KT 3000 DZ BR OVC003 06/05Q10067 TEMPO 1400 -DZ BR=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIBN Report number: 2021/13 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NRK  AIBN  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The plane landed safely at the second approach 15 minutes later. No personal injuries were reported.  The aircraft departed Jeju, South Korea at 20:24 hours with the captain as Pilot Flying on the leg to Osaka-Kansai. The landing briefing commenced at around 20:59 prior to the descent did not include information regarding a tailwind at the time of the landing. As the aircraft had commenced the ILS approach to runway 06L, the controller reported wind from 030Â° at 3 kt. Both the autopilot and the auto-throttle of the aircraft were disengaged at around a radio altitude of 1,200 ft. In addition, the aircraft continued a stabilized approach. The captain, who was assuming that a landing would be made with a tailwind component, planned to put the thrust levers to their idle position earlier than usual when performing a flare in order to prevent that a touchdown would be long down on the runway. At around 21:32:54, the captain moved the thrust levers to their idle position along with initiating the flare at 2Â° pitch angle at a radio altitude of about 30 ft. Although the captain tried to continue raising the nose and to reduce the rate of descent, the timing of such maneuvers was slightly delayed. Reducing the rate of descent was infeasible because the thrust levers had already been set to their idle position. The captain tried to reduce the rate of descent of the aircraft by pulling the control column further. The first officer, who felt the rate of descent was large, pulled the control column to reduce the rate of descent without making any call-out. Having noticed the operation of the FO, the captain kept the control column so as to follow the FO's operation. At around 21:32:57, the right main landing gear of the aircraft touched down at pitch angle of about 3.5Â°, and all spoilers began to deploy when the auto speed brake was activated. Subsequently, after the left main landing gear had touched down, the aircraft bounced. The maximum vertical acceleration recorded in the FDR during this period was 1.87 G. The captain, who was unable to predict the degree of the bounce and assumed that the impact accompanied by the touchdown after the bounce would be hard, executed a go-around maneuver. The pitch angle of the aircraft immediately before executing the go-around was about 5Â°. The aircraft started climbing positively at about 10Â° pitch angle after its both main landing gears touched down again approximately one second after it had executed the go-around.  The aircraft landed on runway 06L conducting the ILS approach again after flying in accordance with the missed approach procedure. Both the flight crew members did not recognize that the aircraft had struck the runway until the scratch marks were found on the lower aft fuselage by mechanics after the aircraft arrived at the allotted parking spot. The scrape mark on the runway was 15 meters long. PROBABLE CAUSES In this accident, it is highly probable that the lower aft fuselage of the aircraft was damaged with contacting the runway because its pitch angle became too high during the go-around following the bounce at the time of the landing. Regarding the pitch angle became too high, it is somewhat likely that because the Captain, who thought the impact after the bounce would become hard and tried to avoid the second touchdown, performed large nose up maneuver.METAR: 12:30 UTC / 21:33 local time: RJBB 091230Z 01003KT 9999 FEW030 BKN045 13/08 Q1020 NOSIG=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JTSB Report number: AA2019-5 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: https://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl?a=20180410-00000039-jij-soci  https://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl?a=20180410-00050070-yom-soci  Flightradar24   Location  Images: photo (c) JTSB; Osaka-Kansai International Airport (KIX/RJBB); 09 April 2018 photo (c) Flightradar24; Osaka-Kansai International Airport (KIX); 09 April 2018 photo (c) JTSB; Osaka-Kansai International Airport (KIX/RJBB); 09 April 2018 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot, the only occupant onboard, sustained minor injuries, and the airplane sustained substantial damage. The airplane was being operated by Hageland Aviation Services, Inc., as a Ravn Connect cargo/mail flight. The flight originated about 07:58, from the Utqiagvik (formerly Barrow) Airport, Alaska, and it was destined for Atqasuk, which is located about 58 miles south. The area between Utqiagvik and Atqasuk consists of remote, flat, featureless, tundra-covered terrain, which is snow-covered in April. Weather conditions at the time of departure consisted of clear skies, 9 miles visibility, and a light wind. After takeoff, the airplane climbed to 2,500 feet msl, and proceeded southbound towards Atqasuk. The pilot said that as the airplane neared Atqasuk, with the autopilot engaged, the airplane descended to about 1,500 feet msl, but then he noticed an area of low fog around Atqasuk. He said that when the airplane was about two miles from the airport, he heard the audible autopilot disengagement annunciator tone sound, which was immediately followed by the pilot's control column pitching forward. The pilot said that he was unable to pull the control column back, and the airplane subsequently descended into instrument meteorological conditions. He said that the airplane continued to descend into the fog, then it struck the snow-covered tundra, and nosed over. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the wings, fuselage, and empennage. A North Slope Borough Search and Rescue helicopter pilot told the NTSB that while en route from Utqiagvik to the accident site he encountered ice fog, reduced visibility, and flat light conditions that made it difficult to discern topographical features on the snow-covered tundra. He noted that as the flight continued, both pilots noticed ice beginning to accumulate on the helicopter's windscreen, so the decision was made to abort the search and rescue flight, and the helicopter returned to Utqiagvik. A search team from Atqasuk eventually reached the accident site on snow machines and transported the pilot to Atqasuk. Probable Cause and Findings: The pilot's decision to continue a visual flight rules flight into an area of instrument meteorological conditions and his subsequent failure to level the airplane after the autopilot disconnected, which resulted in a collision with terrain.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ANC18LA031 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: KTVA  Flightaware  FAA   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; near Atqasuk Airport, AK (ATK); April 2018; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; near Atqasuk Airport, AK (ATK); April 2018; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

A fire ensued. The pilot, who was the sole occupant, died in the crash. Night instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident, and no flight plan was filed for the flight, which departed Richmond-Chesterfield County Airport (FCI), Virginia, about 20:35 and was destined for Shenandoah Valley Regional Airport (SHD), Virginia. According to a friend of the pilot, the pilot had ""a couple of drinks"" while they were preparing dinner. The pilot left her home about 19:30. The pilot's friend thought that the pilot would be going to a hotel because it was getting dark, but FCI security video showed that the pilot arrived at the airport at 20:02 and walked to the airplane at 20:04. The pilot then walked around the airplane for about 3 minutes, boarded the airplane, closed the main cabin door, and initiated the engine start sequence at 20:17. About 2 minutes later, the airplane began to taxi to the departure end of runway 15 and then taxied back to the departure end of runway 33. The takeoff roll began on runway 33 at 20:33. The airport security video showed the windsock, which indicated that the wind favored a departure from runway 15. According to an airport line service employee, the airplane departed with a tailwind. The employee also stated that the pilot did not communicate on the Unicom frequency. According to air traffic control data provided by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), a radar target identified as the accident airplane departed FCI and reached a maximum altitude of about 11500 ft mean sea level (msl) at 20:40. The airplane then began to descend and, at 20:44, leveled off at an altitude of about 4300 ft (which was below the minimum safe altitude of 5700 ft msl for SHD). The airplane remained at 4300 ft until 20:53, when it began a descending left turn. The last two radar returns were 5 seconds apart and showed the airplane at 3300 ft and 2800 msl, which indicated that the airplane was descending about 6000 ft per minute. Radar contact was lost at 20:54. Throughout the flight, the pilot did not have any contact with air traffic control. The FAA prohibits any person from acting or as a crewmember of a civil aircraft while having 0.040 gm/dl or more ethanol in the blood. In addition, the regulation states that no person can act as a crewmember of an aircraft within 8 hours after the consumption of any alcoholic beverage. Probable cause: ""The pilot's loss of control while operating in night instrument meteorological conditions as a result of spatial disorientation. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's decision to operate an airplane after consuming alcohol and his resulting intoxication, which degraded the pilot's judgment and decision-making.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA18FA127 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  cavalierdaily.com   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Crozet, VA; 16 April 2018; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Crozet, VA; 16 April 2018; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Crozet, VA; 16 April 2018; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Crozet, VA; 15 April 2018; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

After running what he thought to be around 250 m on the runway, he was unable to hold the aircraft, which went off the runway and travelled about 70 m through the grass. The right main landing gear and the nose gear broke and the aircraft came to a stop.  Witnesses on the ground indicated that, immediately after touchdown, very thick smoke was observed near the left main landing gear. A long rubber mark was visible from the touchdown area to the aircraftÂs position and was consistent with rubber from the left main landing gear tire.

The forecast weather at Newquay was for overcast cloud at 400 - 500 ft with a gusty crosswind of approximately 20 kt. The co-pilot was pilot flying for the Newquay sector. The takeoff, cruise and descent were uneventful. During the cruise the commander obtained updated weather via the ATIS for Newquay, which gave landing runway 12, the surface wind 210/16 and cloud broken at 400 ft. The flight crew briefed for the approach, discussing the threat of turbulence on final and the potential for a go-around. The pilots planned to use flap 15 for the final approach because no gusts were reported on the ATIS, and to set the propeller condition levers to max in case a go-around was required. The aircraft was established on final for runway 12 at 8 nm and the co-pilot disconnected the autopilot at approximately 500 ft. At approximately 400 ft, the aircraft became displaced from the runway centreline and the co-pilot elected to go around. The goaround was uneventful and the aircraft was repositioned for a second approach. During the downwind leg the commander made a PA to reassure the passengers then briefed the co-pilot to keep the autopilot engaged until slightly later in the approach and to ensure the speed remained between the VREF and VCLIMB speed bugs. The second approach was stable until approximately 50 ft. The tower gave the surface wind as 190Â°/20 kt. At approximately 50 ft the co-pilot reduced power to flight idle to control the airspeed, although neither pilot was aware that the power had been reduced this much. At approximately 30 ft above the runway, the aircraft started to sink rapidly and the commander called ""power, power, power"". The co-pilot increased power and pitched up to arrest the rate of descent, but the aircraft landed firmly, striking its tail on the runway. The aircraft bounced and the commander took control. Observing the ÂTOUCHED RUNWAYÂ light he elected to continue the landing. The aircraft landed and taxied to the gate without further incident. Subsequently one cabin crew member reported minor back pain. No other injuries were reported. Damage was found to several skin panels, frames, stringers and aft pressure bulkhead. Conclusion: ""The tailstrike occurred because the pilot flying reacted instinctively to the high sink rate by increasing pitch attitude and power, rather than increasing power only. The aircraft manufacturer recommends that operators provide annual recurrent training in pitch awareness for flight crew to establish the correct response to high sink rate near the ground.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: EW/G2018/04/09 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  4 January 2014 G-JECX Flybe 0 Paris-Orly Airport (ORY/LFPO) unk Hydraulic system problem Images: photo (c) AAIB; Newquay-Cornwall Airport (NQY/EGHQ); April 2018 photo (c) NTSB; Newquay-Cornwall Airport (NQY/EGHQ); 17 April 2018 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft, a Boeing 737-700, originated from New York-La Guardia Airport at 10:43 for a flight to Dallas-Love Field, Texas. About 11:04, when the aircraft was climbing through FL325, the no.1 engine (CFM56-7B24) suffered an uncontained failure. The flight crew noticed that the no.1 engine rpm dropped to zero, as did the oil pressure. The cabin altitude horn sounded and the aircraft experienced a sudden, uncommanded, left roll of a 41Â° bank angle. The pilots leveled the wing, donned their oxygen masks and initiated an emergency descent. The flight crew then requested air traffic control to give them vectors to the nearest suitable airport. As a result of the uncontained failure, a fan blade and parts of the engine cowling and engine air inlet cowl had separated. Debris impacted a window frame of row 14, causing the window and frame to break away. This resulted in a decompression of the aircraft. Additional debris impacted and damaged the leading edge of the left hand wing. The flight was vectored towards Philadelphia Airport, where the crew requested an extended final approach due to concerns of aircraft controllability. It was decided to land with flaps 5 for that reason, and an approach speed of 165 knots. The aircraft landed on runway 27L at 11:19 hours and the aircraft was stopped on a taxiway. ARFF services attended to the no.1 engine while injured passenger who was seated near the lost window was rushed to hospital. The passenger is reported to have died. Preliminary findings of the NTSB show that the no.13 fan blade of engine no.1 was missing. It appears to have broken away at the hub. There is evidence of metal fatigue in the area where the blade broke. Also, a part of the no.1 engine cowling was reported to have been found at Burnville, PA. Probable Cause: The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determines that the probable cause of this accident was a low-cycle fatigue crack in the dovetail of fan blade No. 13, which resulted in the fan blade separating in flight and impacting the engine fan case at a location that was critical to the structural integrity and performance of the fan cowl structure. This impact led to the in-flight separation of fan cowl components, including the inboard fan cowl aft latch keeper, which struck the fuselage near a cabin window and caused the window to depart from the airplane, the cabin to rapidly depressurize, and the passenger fatality.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NTSB/AAR-19/03 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Philadelphia International Airport, PA (PHL/KPHL); 17 April 2018; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Philadelphia International Airport, PA (PHL/KPHL); 17 April 2018; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Philadelphia International Airport, PA (PHL/KPHL); 17 April 2018; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Philadelphia International Airport, PA (PHL/KPHL); 17 April 2018; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; near  Burnville, PA; 18 April 2018; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; near  Burnville, PA; 18 April 2018; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Philadelphia International Airport, PA (PHL/KPHL); April 2018; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Philadelphia International Airport, PA (PHL/KPHL); 2018; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Philadelphia International Airport, PA (PHL/KPHL); 2018; (publicdomain) photo (c) Flightaware/Google; 17 April 2018 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft, an Airbus A330-323, had taken off from runway 26L at en route to London, U.K. The flight crew reported a no. 2 engine fire electronic centralized aircraft monitor (ECAM) indication at about 500 feet AGL, declared an emergency, shutdown the no. 2 engine, discharged both fire bottles, and initiated an air turn back to the departure airport. During the return the fire warning indication cleared, and the airplane made an uneventful overweight single engine landing on runway 27R at 18:34.  After landing, airport rescue and firefighting (ARFF) crews met the airplane on the runway and observed smoke and flames emanating from the no. 2 engine. ARFF sprayed the engine with fire retardant foam and extinguished the fire. The airplane was towed to the gate and the passengers disembarked. There were no injuries to the passengers or crew and the airplane sustained substantial damage. Probable Cause: The flight crewÂs delayed landing after an in-flight engine fire, which reignited after both fire bottles were discharged and resulted in substantial damage to an engine pylon. Contributing to the delayed landing was likely the flight crewÂs perception that the fire had been extinguished due to the disappearance of the primary engine fire warning indications after the fire detection loops were damaged and that a landing as soon as possible was not perceived to be necessary. Contributing to the duration of the fire was the contamination of an engine fire isolation system component which resulted in hydraulic fluid leaking into the designated engine fire zone after the engine was shutdown and the fire button was pressed.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA18LA163 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 years Download report:  Final report Sources: KCTV5  Flightradar24   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The Boeing 737-800 registered PK-LOO operated on a flight from Sultan Hasanuddin International Airport, Makassar. The Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as Pilot Flying (PF) and the Second in Command (SIC) acted as Pilot Monitoring (PM) on this flight. On board the flight were 181 persons, consisted of two pilots, five flight attendants and 174 passengers. The flight departed Makassar at 17:28 local time and cruised at an altitude of FL330. The flight until descent was uneventful. Prior to commencing their descent, the crew received the latest weather information from the Jalaluddin Tower controller: wind calm, visibility 2,500 meters, slight rain, cloud FEW CB (cumulonimbus) 800 feet and overcast 800 feet, temperature 26Â°C, dew point 24 Â°C, QNH 1008 hPa and QFE 1006 hPa with additional remarks of CB in the approach area. During the descent, at 18:28, Jalaluddin Tower advised the pilot to descend to 5,800 feet and issued a clearance to carry out a VOR/DME approach to runway 27. At 18:32, the Jalaluddin Tower controller informed the pilot that there was rain over the field and requested the aircrafts position. The PM acknowledged the information and reported that the aircraft was on final course runway 27. One minute later a pilot of an ATR aircraft that previously landed informed to JT892 that when they were making the approach, there was heavy rain in the final approach area. The PM acknowledged the information. There was no pilot discussion to anticipate the reported heavy rain. The Jalaluddin Tower controller informed the pilot that the wind direction was 150Â° with velocity of 7 knots, QNH 1008 hPa and issued landing clearance if the pilot was able to see the runway. The PM acknowledged the message and would inform when they were able to see the runway. The pilot requested for high intensity of runway lights and was informed that the runway light had been set to maximum intensity. At 18:34, the PM informed the Jalaluddin Tower controller that the runway was in sight. The Jalaluddin Tower controller then issued landing clearance for JT892 since the controller was able to see the aircraft landing lights. At 18:40, the aircraft touched down, the autobrake operated, the spoiler automatically deployed and the PF selected the engine thrust reversers. The pilots felt that suddenly the rain became very heavy and they were only able to see the runway lights on the left side of the runway. The crew felt an impact and then the aircraft stopped off the left side of the runway at approximately 1,200 meters from the beginning runway 27. The pilot attempted to contact the Jalaluddin Tower controller but this was not received by the controller. The Jalaluddin Tower controller also attempted to contact the pilot, but the pilot did not receive the controllers message.

The crew requested to ""push and hold"" which was granted by the ground controller who added, ""push across to the east line, abeam stand 50R. do not start engines"". These instructions were repeated to the groundcrew. During the pushback, ATC informed the crew of a new CTOT, very close to the present time. The crew informed the groundcrew and advised them that they would start engines after the pushback. Approaching the end of the pushback, the flight crew felt the tug stop abruptly. The commander asked the groundcrew if everything was alright and the groundcrew responded that they had pushed the aircraft too close to the blast fence and were going to pull it forward. The Senior Cabin Crew member called the flight deck on the interphone and informed them that she and the cabin crew seated at the rear of the aircraft felt that the tail of the aircraft had struck something. The commander checked with the groundcrew, who thought it hadnÂt, but the commander contacted engineering who sent out an engineer. On inspection, damage was found to the trailing edge of the left elevator. The commander called the ground controller and informed  them of the collision. The Fire Service attended and, following an inspection, determined that there was no immediate danger to the aircraft or passengers, which was also confirmed by the engineer. The aircraft was towed to Stand 50L and the passengers disembarked using the air stairs. Discussion The clearance was to carry out a pushback of the aircraft to abeam Stand 50R and the headset operator believed this would be when the pilotÂs window was in line with the stand. The pushback continued until the elevator struck the blast fence but the relative positions of the pilotÂs window and the stand were not determined at this point. The poor weather, light and poor clarity of the taxi line as seen by the tug driver meant that all his attention was focussed on his task. This and his restricted viewpoint from the nose of the aircraft prevented him from monitoring the actions of the headset operator and being aware of the proximity of the tail to the blast fence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: EW/G2018/04/18 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The first officer, who was line flying under supervision, was Pilot Flying while the captain, who had a Flight Instructor Rating, was Pilot Monitoring on the flight. The flight was uneventful, the weather conditions were favourable, and the crew requested a visual approach for a landing on runway 10 at Marrakech, which was received at 5NM from the ODALO point, allowing the crew to have a long final approach of about 20NM before landing. The ILS frequency was selected for both pilots, while the FD was switched off when the clearance was received for a visual approach. At 200ft agl the aircraft was below glide path, the first officer corrected by increasing thrust without controlling the vertical path being, causing the aircraft to be high on the glide path. The trainee first officer then reduced thrust (almost to idle) to catch up with the glide path by descending to the runway at 100 feet above ground level, with a very high descent rate. It was at this point that the instructor pilot had to make a decision to either take control to correct the course, or abort the landing and do a go-around as the approach was no longer stabilised and the first officer's corrections were excessive. As the first officer had 500 hours on the type, the captain decided not to take control. Thrust was increased to decrease the rate of descent. The aircraft then made a hard landing with bounce. When the wheels touched the ground during the landing, the captain finally decided to take control. He also decided to reduce thrust further, to avoid a long landing after the bounce. As the aircraft was at a higher height than the recommended flare height, this manoeuvre was poorly executed with a nose-up attitude exceeding the values required for a safe landing. Despite the pilot's action on the control column to remedy the situation, this did not prevent the aft fuselage from contacting the runway. Probable causes of the accident: - Inappropriate execution of the landing procedure by the flight crew; - Inappropriate correction by the first officer to catch up with the landing path;  - Delayed reaction by the captain to rectify the situation;  - Inadequate response by the first officer to the landing procedure; - Late reaction by captain to remedy this situation; - Inadequate decision by the captain to continue the landing. Contributing factors: - Lack of experience in the first officer; - Unfamiliar terrain for the first officer; - Lack of experience of the Type Rating Instructor pilot.METAR: 12:00 UTC /  local time: GMMX 021200Z 36004KT 310V090 9999 FEW020 18/06 Q1017 NOSIG=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Maroc Report number: D.BEA.002.AIG/01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  28 August 2019 OO-JAY TUI fly Belgium 0 Eindhoven Airport, Noord-Brabant min 27 February 2023 OO-JAY TUI fly Belgium, opf TUI fly Netherlands 0 Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS/EHAM) unk Tailstrike Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates17-Oct-2024 18:19 ASN Updated [Cn, Source, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All nine occupants suffered fatal injuries. The aircraft was attached to the Puerto Rico Air National Guard and had been undergoing routine maintenance in Savannah before heading to the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG) at Davis Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona. The MA had been at Savannah for almost a month, since 9 April 2018, to undergo prescheduled fuel cell maintenance and unscheduled work on engine number one by 156 AW maintenance personnel using the facilities of the 165th Airlift Wing.  During takeoff roll, engine no.1 RPM fluctuated and did not provide normal RPM when the captain advanced the throttle lever into the flight range for takeoff. Approximately eight seconds prior to aircraft rotation, engine no.1 RPM and torque significantly decayed, which substantially lowered thrust. The fluctuation on roll and significant performance decay went unrecognized by the crew until rotation, when the captain commented on aircraft control challenges and the aircraft veered left and nearly departed the runway into the grass before it achieved flight.  As the crew retracted the landing gear, they identified the engine no.1 RPM and torque malfunction and the captain called for engine shutdown. However, the crew failed to complete the Takeoff Continued After Engine Failure procedure, the Engine Shutdown procedure, and the After Takeoff checklist as directed by the Flight Manual, and the aircraft's flaps remained at 50 percent. Additionally, the captain banked left into the inoperative engine, continued to climb, and varied left and right rudder inputs. At an altitude of approximately 900 feet mean sea level and 131 knots indicated air speed, the captain input over nine degrees of left rudder, the aircraft skidded left, the left wing stalled, and the aircraft departed controlled flight and impacted the terrain on Georgia State Highway 21. USAF AIB CONCLUSION: ""After a comprehensive investigation into this mishap, I find, by a preponderance of the evidence, the cause of the mishap was MP1Âs improper application of left rudder, which resulted in a subsequent skid below three-engine minimum controllable airspeed, a left-wing stall, and the MAÂs departure from controlled flight. Additionally, I find, by a preponderance of the evidence, the MCÂs failure to adequately prepare for emergency actions, the MCÂs failure to reject the takeoff, the MCÂs failure to properly execute appropriate after takeoff and engine shutdown checklists and procedures, and the Mishap MaintainersÂ failure to properly diagnose and repair engine number one substantially contributed to the mishap.""METAR: 14:53 UTC / 10:53 local time: KSAV 021453Z VRB06KT 10SM FEW035 FEW250 24/14 A3035 RMK AO2 SLP277 T02440139 5300915:33 UTC / 11:33 local time: KSAV 021533Z 04008KT 10SM FEW035 FEW250 26/14 A3035 RMK AO2 T0256013915:53 UTC / 11:53 local time: KSAV 021553Z VRB03KT 10SM FEW015 FEW035 SCT250 26/14 A3034 RMK AO2 SLP274 FU FEW015 T02560139Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: USAF AIB Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: WBTV   Location  Images: photo (c) IAFF574 Savannah; Port Wentworth, GA; 02 May 2018 photo (c) USAF; Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport, GA (SAV); 02 May 2018 photo (c) USAF; near Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport, GA (SAV); 02 May 2018 photo (c) USAF; Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport, GA (SAV); 02 May 2018 photo (c) USAF; Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport, GA (SAV); 02 May 2018 photo (c) USAF; Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport, GA (SAV); 02 May 2018 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

Medical assistance was requested via ATC. The aircraft landed normally at the destination airport.   The presence of the area of severe turbulence close to the Alps over Northern Italy was foreseen and represented on the flight documentation available to the crew. The captain had briefed the cabin crew as such. After numerous calls on frequency from crews of other aircraft that were passing through the turbulence area, the captain reiterated to the CCM4, who had entered the cabin, the presence of the turbulence area. The captain then warned the passengers to return to their seats and activated the seat belt sign. Shortly before the encounter with the turbulence, the captain warned a cabin crew member, via intercom, that the crew had to sit down due to the impending turbulence. During entry into the area of severe turbulence, the FDR recorded maximum vertical acceleration values of -1.20 G and + 2.76 G, with a maximum variation of + 3.96 G.

During the severe turbulence, the cabin crew were each still not secured in their seats. Three cabin crew members were injured (SCCM, CCM2 and CCM3). The cabin crew members were initially taken to Verona hospital for first aid. The SCCM, who suffered a fractured leg, was later transferred to the UK for surgery. CCM2 suffered a contusion injury to the left hemi-costat. CCM3 sustained a lacerated contusion wound to the scalp. CAUSES The accident was caused by a sudden encounter with severe turbulence during the descent with the cabin crew not yet secured in their seats.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ANSV Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 years and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: http://www.ansv.it/It/Detail_relazioni.asp?ID=2089  https://bea.aero/les-enquetes/evenements-notifies/detail/accident-de-lairbus-a319-immatricule-g-dbca-et-exploite-par-british-airways-survenu-le-03-01-2018-pres-de-verone-enquete-menee-par-ansv---italie/  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates06-Jan-2018 12:29 gianniprof Added 06-Jan-2018 12:31 harro Updated [Aircraft type, Cn, Operator, Total fatalities, Other fatalities, Location, Nature, Departure airport, Narrative, ]17-Jun-2024 10:54 ASN Updated [Category, ]28-Jun-2024 19:24 ASN Updated [Time, Narrative, Accident report, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The jet carried four passengers and a three-person crew. The aircraft was parked at the north end of the apron. Once the passengers had left, the flight crew put covers on the engines and external sensors. The next planned flight was a positioning flight on 4 January 2018, to Ekaterinburg, Russia, without passengers. The crew arrived at the airport to prepare for the flight at approximately 15:00. Take-off, as per the flight plan, was to happen at 17:00. The ground handling company transported them to the aircraft by bus at approximately 15:20. The captain opened the door at which time the cabin assistant entered the cabin. The captain and the co-pilot placed their flight bags behind the cockpit and went back outside. The co-pilot placed the aircrew's baggage into the rear baggage compartment which opens from the outside. The captain and the co-pilot removed the engine covers which they had put in place on the day of their arrival. These were put into their own storage bags and also placed in the baggage compartment. Following this, the captain went into the cockpit and started the APU, which generates electricity for aircraft systems and bleed air for heating the cabin. The co-pilot began to brush off the snow that had fallen on the aircraft. A moment later the captain came out to help the co-pilot. At first, he worked with his bare hands. Due to the extremely cold conditions (-22Â°C), however, he went back inside to fetch a pair of gloves. When he came back out, he closed the door. A little later the cabin assistant inside the cabin felt strange pressure in her ears and chest. She went into the cockpit and attempted to get the attention of the pilots working outside by knocking on the window. The pilots noticed the knocking and the captain went to open the door. According to the co-pilotÂs observations it was unusually difficult for the captain to get the door open. Then, the captain pulled harder on the door handle at which time the door blew open with excessive force, hitting the captain who was standing underneath the door and knocking him to the ground. The pressure wave also knocked the co-pilot down, who had been standing approximately one metre from the left side of the door. The co-pilot stood up and saw the captain lying on his back on the ground. Realising that the captain was unconscious, the co-pilot turned him on his side. Then he entered the cabin and saw the cabin assistant in a semi-seated position on the floor of the cabin. The co-pilot shook the assistantÂs shoulder and advised her to go outside.  The captain died as a result of the serious injuries he sustained at the site of the occurrence. The co-pilot had not sustained any physical injuries. The cabin assistant had bruises on her right arm, continued to feel chest pain and was diagnosed with a mild concussion.  The cabin sustained substantial damage. The cockpitÂs aft left bulkhead and the cabinÂs forward left bulkhead were nearly torn off. CONCLUSIONS: 1. When the aircraft is parked outside for a longer period, some pilots may close the outflow valve to prevent the ingestion of contaminants into the valve, or upstream into the cabin. 2. When the APU is being run one must check that the outflow valve is fully open. If it is not possible to ensure that the valve is open or to remove differential pressure by other means, the door must not be closed. 3. The door had no indication warning of excessive cabin pressure, nor an opening for depressurisation. The cabin was pressurised because the APU bleed air was ducted into the cabin, the outflow valve was closed and the door was also closed. Significant differential pressure existed between the cabin and the outside. 4. Cabin pressurisation on the ground also creates a hazard for several other groups of professionals, such as aircraft mechanics, ground handling staff, aircraft cargo loaders and rescue personnel.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIB Finland Report number: L2018-01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) Safety Investigation Authority, Finland; KittilÃ¤ Airport (KTT0; 04 January 2018 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

WestJet flight 2425, a Boeing 737-800 registered C-FDMB, landed on runway 24R at 17:39 hours local time following a flight from CancÃºn, Mexico. The flight taxied to Terminal 3 and was stopped with the engines and APU running, on Taxi-lane 2 on the north side of Pier B. The flight crew were waiting for ground personnel to marshal the aircraft into position at Gate B12. The WestJet aircraft was positioned directly behind and perpendicular to a Sunwing Airlines Boeing 737-800 (C-FPRP), which was parked at Gate B13.  The Sunwing aircraft was being prepared to be towed to another location at the airport. A Sunwing maintenance technician was in the cockpit of C-FPRP, and the aircraft's APU was running. Two ground personnel were in the cab of the tow vehicle. The tow vehicle was informed by the North Apron controller to pushback at their discretion. The Sunwing aircraft (under tow) began to move back and the APU contacted the right wing of the stationary WestJet aircraft. A fire rapidly ensued. The WestJet flight crew immediately commenced the required steps for an evacuation, and an evacuation was ordered shortly after. The tow vehicle operator pulled the Sunwing aircraft back towards the gate to separate the two aircraft. The slides on the WestJet aircraft were utilized on doors L1, R1 and L2, along with the over-wing exits on the left side; all passengers evacuated safely. The maintenance technician aboard the Sunwing aircraft exited the left cockpit window using the emergency rope and received minor injuries. ARFF arrived at the scene, and extinguished the fire. The Sunwing aircraft sustained substantial damage. Summary: In this accident, the pushback was conducted without the use of wing walkers, which is not in accordance with Swissport, Sunwing, and GTAA requirements. The investigation also determined that wing walkers were normally used by Swissport only when pushing back aircraft with passengers on board. In addition, the GTAA apron radio officer used phraseology that was not consistent with GTAA AMU procedures. WestJetÂs pre-flight safety briefings do not inform passengers to leave behind carry-on baggage in the event of an evacuation. During this occurrence, several passengers retrieved their carry-on baggage, despite the fact that FAs repeatedly provided specific instructions to the contrary.

Kennedy International Airport, USA. The right-hand wingtip of a Boeing 777-31BER (B-7185) operated by China Southern Airlines struck the APU in the tail of a Boeing 777-369ER (9K-AOC), operated by Kuwait Airways.  There were no personal injuries. Kuwait Airways flight KU117, a Boeing 777-300ER (9K-AOC), landed at 18:41 local time and due to lack of gates available, was assigned Hardstand 63. Due to a light pole adjacent to Hardstand 63 blocking the offload of the forward hold, both ground handling agencies coordinated in parking the aircraft short of the 777-300 stop mark to allow for the offloading of the forward hold.    The aircraft was parked on the 737 stop mark at 1855 LT and due to the tail overhanging into taxiway BB, that was closed.   China Southern flight CZ300, a Boeing 777-300 (B-7185), was towed off gate 6 at Terminal 4 at 20:00 LT with no available hardstand to park, so the aircraft was towed around the terminal area as needed during the traffic congestion until a hardstand was available.   Just prior to 23:40 LT, Hardstand 73 became available, and China Southern CZ300 was under tow at Spot 2 behind Terminal 4.  china southern cz300 was instructed  to proceed to hardstand 73 from spot 2 via taxiway g, taxiway bb, and taxiway h.   The pushback driver proceeded to turn right on taxiway G, then right onto taxiway BB (which had been closed earlier due to the KU overhang) and the right wing tip of CZ300 impacted the tail of KU117 at 23:45 LT. The pushback driver continued forward as he did not feel the impact and made a left turn onto taxiway H, then right turn into Hardstand 73.   Substantial damage to the tail of KU117, including the right and left horizontal stabilizer, elevator, tail cone and APU. Substantial damage to the CZ300  right wing and leading edge.Sources: http://gulfnews.com/news/americas/usa/plane-bumps-into-kuwait-airways-flight-ready-for-take-off-at-jfk-international-1.2152448  https://www.spa.gov.sa/viewfullstory.php?lang=en&newsid=1705945  FAA Media:The #PAPD Aircraft Rescue Fire Fighter Unit (ARFF) responded to Terminal 4, JFK, last night; a China Southern 777's wing tip struck the tail end of a Kuwait Airways 777 causing damage to both aircraft. #PAPDPROTECTSNYNJ pic.twitter.com/1g2isyyHD4â Port Authority PBA (@PAPD911) January 6, 2018 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates06-Jan-2018 12:19 gerard57 Added 06-Jan-2018 12:23 harro Updated [Aircraft type, Registration, Cn, Location, Departure airport, Source, Narrative, ]06-Jan-2018 12:58 harro Updated [Phase, Destination airport, Embed code, Narrative, ]06-Jan-2018 13:07 harro Updated [Embed code, Narrative, ]18-Oct-2024 17:33 ASN Updated [Other fatalities, Source, Damage, Narrative, ]18-Oct-2024 18:12 ASN Updated [Total occupants, Other fatalities, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The aircraft departed Nassau Airport at 19:00 hours local time on an instrument flight plan. Initially a Beech 1900 had been scheduled for this flight, but the airline decided to use C6-MIC, an EMB-110 Bandeirante, instead.  A revised flight plan was not submitted to ATC. Weather at the destination, Governor's Harbour Airport, was poor due to heavy rainfall. The pilot in command of the aircraft initially attempted a landing on runway 15 at Governor's Harbour Airport but executed a go-around when visual contact was lost due to heavy rain. On the second attempt for landing, a decision was made to switch to runway 33 and while on final approach to runway 33, visual contact was lost again and a second go-around was executed. On the third attempt the pilot landed on runway 33, but seconds after touchdown there was a collapse of the left main landing gear which subsequently led to a runway excursion taking place. Investigators noticed that the landing gear selector switch was located in the ""UP"" position. Consultation with the operator's maintenance personnel and the aircraft manufacturer has determined, based on the systems operation, that if the landing gear switch is placed in the ""UP"" position and the gear contact micro-switch on either landing gear is contaminated with dirt, water or other contaminants, or if the switch is shorted out for whatever reason, it is possible that the gear may not retract when commanded by the selection of the gear switch. In this instance, it is possible that the gear position lights may still indicate ""3-green lights"" (which normally indicates the gear as being ""down and locked"") despite the gear selector handle being selected to the ""UP"" position. However, once you land or the contaminant is removed or the ""system short"" is corrected, or no longer exists, there is a possibility that the gear could collapse (if the gear selector switch is in the ""UP"" position, as was the case). The AAID believes this to be the case, as no mechanical irregularities have been found or could be replicated that would otherwise explain why the gear collapsed.  The AAID also investigated the licensing and record keeping regarding the flight crew. It appeared that the captain of the flight initially had a US FAA license. During his stay in the US, he was convicted and incarcerated for controlled substance violations. As a consequence his FAA commercial pilot license was revoked for life on 11 August 2009. After returning to the Bahamas, he applied for an Airman License Validation based on a (revoked!) Foreign License in June 2011. It is unclear if he received this validation at that time. He was issued a commercial pilot license in May 2013, which was renewed in 2015 and valid until August 2020. The AAID found that no duty time, flight time or sectors were recorded for the captain between a proficiency check was completed on March 2013 and January 9, 2018 (date of the accident).  It also appeared that the Nassau-Lynden Pindling International Airport refused to issue an ID badge to the captain for unescorted access to the restricted airside, citing his US criminal record. Nevertheless he subsequently obtained an ID badge issued by the Grand Bahama Airport Company in Freeport, Grand Bahama. This was not valid for Nassau Airport, yet he managed to gain airside at Nassau without any problems. The AAID attributes this accident to ""pilot error."" The poor decision making exercised by the crew in attempting several landings in severe weather has been determined as the probable cause of the accident. Also contributing to this accident was the actions of the crew where, after 2 failed landing attempts and executing 2 go around maneuvers, they failed to realize the landing gear selector handle was selected in the ""UP"" position when the aircraft was configured for the 3rd landing. The situation was further exacerbated by additional human factor errors such as operating under periods of high stress, departing after such long delays, operating in severe weather, and flying at night- all factors experienced by the crew, which are contributory in this accident. Crew training, qualification, and authorization has been investigated and found questionable and also may have contributed to the accident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAID Bahamas Report number: AO-18-000002 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Local Airline Crash Lands - All Passengers Safe (eleutheranews.com, 10 Jan 2018) History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  24 June 2020 C6-MIC Pineapple Air 0 North Eleuthera International Airport (MYEH) min Tire failure 23 February 2024 C6-MIC Pineapple Air 0 Nassau-Lynden Pindling International Airport (NAS/MYNN) non Engine failure Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

During climb after takeoff from KrakÃ³w Airport, the nose landing gear (NLG) did not retract after moving the landing gear control lever to the UP position. Amber light N DOOR (nose door open), red light NOSE (nose gear not uplocked or downlocked) and red light on the landing gear control lever (gear in transit) illuminated. The CPT decided to continue the flight to the destination (EPWA). During the landing approach to EPWA, the crew extended the landing gear with the alternate system. The main landing gear (MLG) was extended and locked, but the NLG did not change its position. The crew made an emergency landing on EPWA RWY11 with NLG in the transit position, which was folded during the landing roll. When the plane came to rest on runway 11, the passengers were evacuated. All passengers and crew left the plane uninjured. The plane was damaged to an extent that required repair. Cause of the accident The immediate cause of the accident was excessive free play in the retraction/extension system of the nose landing gear. Contributing factors 1. Lack of procedures to measure and monitor the free play in the nose landing gear retraction/extension system during the Time Between Overhaul (30 000 Cycles or 14 years). 2. Lack of analysis of three-point landings which resulted in overload of NLG. 3. Lack of dedicated technological cards to verify possible damage caused by unusual events, such as hitting the drawbar connected to the airplane by a tug.

The flight departed Cox's Bazar Airport at 10:53 hours local time and landed on runway 34 at Jessore Airport at 12:03. After clearing the runway via Romeo while taxying into and following the eastern taxy yellow guide line for parking into the BAY-1 at Jessore apron, the captain noticed four amber caution lights illuminate on the hydraulic panel. Subsequently, the captain noticed he lost the response of nose wheel steering. Upon application of brakes, there was no response. Soon after the captain and co-pilot checked and found hydraulic quantity reduced with zero pressure. The aircraft veered to the left and went out of the concrete apron into the soft ground. This resulted the left main wheel  striking a concrete slab causing the affected wheel to bend rearward and collapse. The left engine propeller struck the ground.  As per the captain and first officer, at that time, both tried to build-up hydraulic pressure with the hand pump but to no avail.4. According to the captain, he carried out a visual inspection and observed that the hydraulic reservoir installed in right hand engine was completely depleted. CAUSES: Metal fatigue leading to the breakage and dislocation of the hydraulic fitting that gave rise to loss of hydraulic fluid resulting the loss of steering wheel control and braking during taxing of the aircraft. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS Human factor: Delay in detecting the four hydraulic failure lights, especially by the pilot monitoring, during the landing roll and early part of taxing into the apron owing to the conspicuous location of the lights when the pilotsÂ eyes usually remain outside the cockpit.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIG-BD Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Aircraft Accident Investigation Group of Bangladesh   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft operated on a flight from Lagos, where it departed at 14:28 hours local time. The captain was the Pilot Flying  and the co-pilot was the Pilot Monitoring. The departure, cruise and approach to Abuja Airport were uneventful. Although runway 04 was the active runway, the aircraft was cleared for radar vectors for a visual final approach to runway 22. The aircraft was cleared to land at 15:17 hours. The reported wind by the tower was 070Â°at 7 knots. At 15:18, the aircraft landed slightly left of the runway centre line. According to the crew the aircraft started skidding left to right. The crew further reported that, as the brakes were applied, they noticed the aircraft oscillating left and right. The oscillation increased continuously until eventually the aircraft finally swivelled on the right shoulder of the runway where it came to a complete stop on a Magnetic Heading of 160Â°. Skid marks indicated that the aircraft steered in an S-pattern with increasing amplitude down the runway. On the last right turn, the right main wheel went into the grass and on the final left pattern, the right main landing gear strut detached from its main attachment point. Causal Factor: The use of improper directional control techniques to maintain the aircraft on the runway.

Preflight planning had noted the destination airport's runway conditions as ""good."" As the flight neared the destination airport and the crew conducted the approach checklist, the captain stated, ""light snow ... maybe slippery.""  When the crew checked the airportÂs automated terminal information service, the broadcast included ""light freezing rain."" The flight was transferred to the tower controller, who told the crew that the airport operations crew was on the runway about 20 minutes earlier and advised that it was starting to pick up traces of ice. The captain acknowledged the transmission and, after conducting a missed approach to runway 6L, requested to land on runway 24R. During the approach to runway 24R, the tower controller reported wind at 020Â° at 25 knots and also at 010Â° at 25 knots.  The crewmembers reported that, after touchdown, they applied maximum braking; however, the airplane did not slow and skidded off the end of the runway into the engineered material arresting system (EMAS), which resulted in substantial damage to the fuselage and a collapsed nose gear.Â  The crew stated that the runway grooves had been ""smoothed out"" by ice accumulations. A first responder reported that the ramp and taxiways were very icy, adding that the end of the runway and EMAS had a sheet of ice. A review of the airport's snow and ice control plan noted that the airport did not have pavement surface sensors and that operations personnel would monitor the airfield as conditions dictated. An airport operations log entry for a runway and field inspection, recorded about 24 minutes before the accident, noted a temperature of 31Â°F and a braking coefficient of 40 , with runways and taxiways wet. A log entry for a runway and field inspection recorded about 6 minutes after the accident noted a braking coefficient of 30-35, with runways and taxiways wet. The Runway Condition Assessment Matrix contained in Advisory Circular 150/5200-30D states that a braking coefficient of 40 or higher is the equivalent of a pilot-reported braking action of ""good,"" while a braking coefficient of 30-35 would be medium to poor. The field conditions noted during the pilotsÂ preflight planning indicated ""good"" braking conditions; however, the captain's statement of ""light snow ... maybe slippery,"" along with the tower controller's report that the runway was starting to pick up traces of ice, indicated that the crew was aware of the potential for braking conditions that were less than good, which would decrease braking action and increase the stopping distance. Further, the crewÂs selection of runway 24R, which led to the presence of a tailwind, also would decrease braking action. Probable Cause: The airplane's reduced braking performance due to an ice-covered runway, which resulted in a runway excursion. Contributing to the accident was the crew's selection of a runway with a tailwind.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All 65 passengers and 6 crew members were killed. The aircraft took off from runway 14R at Moscow's Domodedovo Airport at 14:21 hours local time (11:21 UTC). Weather about the time of departure at Domodedovo Airport included limited visibility (2100m) during light snowfall. Temperature was -5Â°C, overcast cloud deck at 2600 feet AGL. The Interstate Aviation Committee stated that, prior to departure, the heating of the three pitot tubes had not been turned on.  After takeoff, at an altitude of 130-150 m (425-490 ft) above ground level, the autopilot was switched on. Flaps were raised as the aircraft climbed through an altitude of 550 m (1800 feet). About 2 minutes 30 seconds after the takeoff, at an altitude of about 1300 meters (4265 feet) and an instrument speed of 465-470 km/h, there were discrepancies between the air speed readings on the captain's side compared to the standby airspeed indicator. The airspeed on the copilot's side is unknown as this parameter was not registered by the flight data recorder. There were no significant difference in the altitude indications. After another 25 seconds, the discrepancies reached about 30 km/h with the speed on the captain's side being greater. After about 50 seconds, at an altitude of about 2000 meters (6560 ft), the airspeed on the standby airspeed indicator was higher and continued to increase while the airspeed on the captains ASI continued to decrease. The flight crew then disconnected the autopilot. The airspeed on the captain's side continued to decrease, while the standby ASI showed 540-560 km/h. About 50 seconds after the autopilot was turned off, the flight passed an altitude of 1700-1900 m (5580-6230 ft) with vertical loads ranging from 1.5 to 0.5 g. Subsequently the aircraft entered a steep descent with the ASI on the captain's side showing 0 km/h, and the standby ASI showing 200 km/h. The pitch angle decreased to -30/-35 degrees with a vertical load factor of  0 g. The aircraft impacted a snowy field around 14:27:05 and disintegrated. Before the collision with the ground, the standby ASI had increased to 800 km/h with the captain's ASI still displaying 0 km/h. The captain of the An-148 had 2168 hours on type, of which 58 as captain. The first officer had 672 hours on type. The AN-148-100V RA-61704 crash occurred due to erroneous actions of the crew at the stage of climbing in instrument weather conditions at unreliable readings of instrument speed caused by icing (blockage of ice) of all three pitot tubes, which led to the loss of control over the parameters of the aircraft, its transfer to dive and collision with the ground. The accident was classified as a loss of control in flight (LOC-I). The investigation revealed systemic weaknesses in the identification of hazards and risk control, the inoperability of the airline's flight safety management system and the lack of control over the level of training of crew members by aviation authorities at all levels, which led to the issuance of certificates of aviation personnel and the admission to the flights of the crew, which did not fully meet the qualification requirements. The most likely contributing factors were: - Hurry of the crew in preparation for the flight due to the late arrival of the aircraft from the previous flight and attempts to ""catch up"" with the time; - Skipping by the crew of the operation to switch on the pitot tube heating before takeoff and failing to comply with the section of the check list ""BEFORE TAKE-OFF"", which provides for the control of this action; - design features of the An-148 aircraft in terms of the restrictions on the duration of pitot tube heating operation on the ground, which led to the need to carry out operations to control the inclusion of pitot tube heating and compliance with the principle of ""dark cockpit"" in a separate section of the ""BEFORE THE FLIGHT"" check list, which is performed immediately before the start of the takeoff run, which creates additional risks of missing these operations. These actions are provided in the section ""ON THE RUNWAY START""; - systematic failure of the airline's crews to comply with the ""dark cockpit"" principle and the requirements of the radar, which contributed to ""getting used"" to the takeoff with the presence of emergency and warning messages on the Integrated system and alarm indicator (KISS) and did not allow to identify the fact that the pitot tube heating was not included. In the accident flight before takeoff, six warning messages were displayed on the KISS, including three messages about the absence of pitot tube heating; - design features of the An-148 aircraft, connected with the impossibility to disable the display of a number of warning messages on the KISS even when performing the whole range of works provided for by the MMEL while ensuring the flight with delayed defects; - low safety culture in the airline, which was manifested in: systematic failure to record in the flight log the failures detected during the flight, as well as in the performance of flights with the failures not eliminated and/or not included in the list of delayed failures, accompanied by the corresponding messages on the KISS; - Failure to take necessary measures in case of detection of previous facts of untimely activation of pitot tube heating by crews based on the results of express analysis of flight information; - Unreadiness of the crew to take actions in case of triggering the alarm ""Speed of Emergency"" due to the lack of appropriate theoretical training in the airline and the impossibility to work out this special situation on the flight simulation device and / or during airfield training and, as a consequence, failure to comply with the procedures provided for after triggering of this alarm; - Absence of federal aviation regulations for certification of flight simulators, the development of which is provided for by the Air Code of the Russian Federation; - Approval for the existing AN-148 flight simulators of the IFC Training LLC and the CTC of the Saint-Petersburg State University of Civil Aviation without taking into account their actual capabilities to reproduce special flight cases, as well as the provisions of FAR-128; - Absence of specific values of flight parameters (engine operation mode, pitch and roll angles, etc.) in the aircraft's flight maMETAR: 10:30 UTC / 13:30 local time: UUDD 111030Z 14005MPS 2500 R14R/1800U R14L/P2000D -SHSN BKN007 BKN026CB M05/M06 Q1019 R14R/590293 R14L/590392 TEMPO 1000 SHSN11:00 UTC / 14:00 local time: UUDD 111100Z 14006MPS 1800 R14R/1900U R14L/1800U SHSN BKN007 BKN026CB M05/M06 Q1019 R14R/590293 R14L/590392 NOSIG11:30 UTC / 14:30 local time: UUDD 111130Z 13006MPS 2100 -SN SCT008 OVC026 M05/M06 Q1019 R14R/590293 R14L/590392 TEMPO 1200 SHSN BKN012CB12:00 UTC / 15:00 local time: UUDD 111200Z 13005MPS 1900 R14R/2000D R14L/1900D SN SCT007 OVC026 M05/M06 Q1019 R14R/590293 R14L/590491 TEMPO 1200 SHSN BKN012CBAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: RT.com  Flightradar24 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  28 July 2013 RA-61704 Rossiya 0 Saint Petersburg-Pulkovo Airport (LED/ULLI) min Engine failure 23 August 2013 RA-61704 Rossiya 0 Saint Petersburg-Pulkovo Airport (LED/ULLI) min Location  Images: photo (c) MAK; Moskva-Domodedovo Airport (DME/UUDD); 11 February 2018 photo (c) Flightradar24; Moskva-Domodedovo Airport (DME/UUDD); 11 February 2018 photo (c) ASN; Moskva-Domodedovo Airport (DME/UUDD); 11 February 2018 photo (c) MAK; Moskva-Domodedovo Airport (DME/UUDD); February 2018 photo (c) MAK; Moskva-Domodedovo Airport (DME/UUDD); February 2018 photo (c) MAK; Moskva-Domodedovo Airport (DME/UUDD); February 2018 photo (c) Papas Dos; Moskva-Domodedovo Airport (DME/UUDD); 06 May 2017; (CC:by) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft, an Airbus A330-223, took off from runway 18R at 22:52 hours. When the aircraft was climbing out of 1700ft AMSL, the no. 1 engine fire warning came ON. A few seconds later, the crew declared an emergency and requested an immediate return which was approved by ATC. The aircraft landed at about 22:59 and stopped on runway 18R. The Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting Services (ARFFS) reported observing fire on engine no.1 and extinguished it. Passengers were evacuated using the emergency slides on the right side of the aircraft. One passenger sustained serious injuries while 11 suffered minor injuries. Causal Factor An overtemperature condition and localized fire within the No. 1 engine cowling triggered a fire warning. The overtemperature and fire were caused by the ignition of fuel from a hairline crack on the fuel manifold supplying fuel nozzle 1. Contributory factor The fuel manifold cracking can be attributed to high vibratory stresses due to coupling of an acoustic combustor mode and a fuel manifold structural mode. Note: AIB Nigeria rated the occurence a 'Serious Incident'. However, as per ICAO Annex 13, this event was an Accident as one occupant had suffered serious injuries.

All on board were killed. The flight departed Mehrabad Airport at 08:05 hours local time and climbed to the cruising altitude of FL210. At 09:22 the aircraft was over the Isfahan (IFN) VOR. The flight requested permission to descend from FL210 to FL170. This was approved by Tehran ACC. The flight followed Airway W114 from the OBTUX navaid to the Yasuj DVOR/DME. Minimum altitude on that airway is FL170. Minimum safe altitude (MSA) over the sector close to Yasuj Airport is 15500 feet. Weather reported to the crew indicated a cloud ceiling of 15000 feet. Despite their clearance for FL170 and the MSA in the area, the crew subsequently selected FL150 as their target altitude.  The flight levelled off at FL150 at 09:28 hours and the de-ice & anti-ice systems were switched on. Subsequently the flight crew selected the autopilot's altitude mode to FL150. The aircraft then entered a mountain wave with vertical (updraft) winds reaching up to 3000 ft/min with associated icing conditions. Since the autopilot attempted to maintain FL150, engine power reduced to flight idle and the aircraft pitched down -4Â°. In these conditions the speed gradually reduced from a Calibrated Airspeed (CAS) of 205 knots. At 09:29:44 the flight crew switched off the de-ice & anti-ice systems. The aircraft then entered a mountain wave downdraft. Engine powered increased and the nose pitched up because the autopilot was attempting to get back to FL150. The CAS meanwhile dropped to 130 knots. The pilot then selected FL140 on the autopilot as the airspeed dropped to 118 knots. The stall warning sounded and the autopilot disconnected automatically. Airspeed increased to 134 knots as the aircraft descended at a rate of -3200 ft/m. At 09:31:22 the flight crew re-engaged the autopilot and set FL150 as their target altitude. Four seconds later the aircraft became close to the surrounding mountainous terrain and the EGPWS alarm sounded. Radio altitude at that point was 3643 feet (pressure altitude 13869 ft). The autopilot was disengaged again as the aircraft continued to lose altitude. Unable to regain altitude the flight crew noticed the mountain side ahead rolled the plane -86Â° to the left. The nose pitched up and the aircraft impacted the side of a mountain at 09:31:41. The wreckage was located the following day in the snow, 350 feet below the top of a 13,412 ft high mountain. Probable causes (from final report): The main cause of accident: The accident was happened due to many chains of considered causes but the 'Human Factor' had main role for the conclusion of the scenario. The Cockpit Crew action which has caused dangerous conditions for the flight is considered as main cause. Based on provided evidences, the errors of cockpit crew were as follows: - Continuing to the Yasouj airport for landing against Operation manual of the Company, due to low altitude ceiling of the cloud and related cloud mass. They should divert to alternate airport. - Descending to unauthorized altitude below minimum of the route and MSA - Lack of enough CRM during flight - Failure to complete the stall recovery (flap setting, max RPM). - Inappropriate use of Autopilot after Stall condition - Inadequate anticipation for bad weather based on OM (Clouds, Turbulence, and Icing ...) - Quick action to switch off anti-ice system and AOA - Failure to follow the Check lists and standard call out by both pilots Contributing Factors: The contributive factors to this accident include but are not limited to the following: - the airline was not capable to detect systematic defectives about : - effectiveness of crew training about Meteorology, OM, SOP, ... - enough operational supervision on pilot behaviors - The lack of SIGMET about Mountain Wave or Severe Mountain wave - Unclear procedure for stall recovery in FCOM - Lack of warning in aircraft manuals by manufacturer for flight crew awareness about mountain wave. - Lack of APM System to alert crew about performance degradationMETAR: 05:30 UTC / 09:00 local time: OISY 180530Z 09004KT 9999 FEW035CB SCT040 OVC090 14/M01 Q102206:00 UTC / 09:30 local time: OISY 180600Z 13004KT 9999 FEW035CB SCT040 OVC090 13/M00 Q102106:30 UTC / 10:00 local time: OISY 180630Z 14006KT 9999 FEW035CB SCT040 OVC090 15/M02 Q1021Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Iran Report number: A13961129EPATS Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: PressTV  Mehr News   Location  Images: photo (c) aerospacetalk.ir; near Yasuj Airport (YES/OISY); 20 February 2018 photo (c) aerospacetalk.ir; near Yasuj Airport (YES/OISY); 20 February 2018 photo (c) Google Earth / ASN annotations; near Yasuj Airport (YES/OISY); 18 February 2018 photo (c) CAO Iran / ASN annotations; near Yasuj Airport (YES/OISY); 18 February 2018 photo (c) CAO Iran; near Yasuj Airport (YES/OISY); 18 February 2018 photo (c) CAO Iran; near Yasuj Airport (YES/OISY); 18 February 2018 photo (c) Aeroprints.com; Dubai Airport (DXB/OMDB); 01 October 2006; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates03-Jan-2025 14:42 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The first officer was the Pilot Flying (PF) while the captain was the Pilot Monitoring (PM). Following an uneventful en route part of the flight, the aircraft was issued descent clearances to FL220 and then further down to FL80. During descent, the PF briefed for the localizer approach to runway 21. Port Harcourt Approach then reported the presence of cumulonimbus (Cb) clouds along the approach path of runway 21, and requested flight 363 to report intentions. Dana 363 responded ""I will like to come closer then we take our decision I will advise"". Meanwhile, the Tower controller informed the Approach controller that the intensity of rain had increased to heavy rain. At 18:43 Arik Air 766 peformed a go around on the approach to runway 03 due to windshear.  At 18:45, Dana 363 was cleared for the LOC approach to runway 21. Shortly afterwards the captain took over control after realizing the Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) 2 was unserviceable. When the aircraft was 12 miles to touch down, the Approach controller instructed the flight to contact Tower. The crew was engaged in changing the frequencies on the navigation radio receivers since the VOR DME was not showing. An initial attempt by the PM to contact the Tower was not on the correct frequency, during which both Tower and Approach were trying to contact the aircraft. Approximately 1.5 minutes after the first attempt, contact with the Tower was established on the correct frequency. The captain then instructed the first officer to watch out for the runway. A few seconds after, the captain was heard yelling for wipers. After a while, the captain sighted the runway and instructed the first officer to report this to the Tower controller. Thirty-two seconds later, an aural warning ""Sink rate""! ""Sink rate""!! ""Sink rate""!!! ""Sink rate""!!!! came on. The aircraft descended through approach minimums (460 feet AGL), crossed the threshold and did a smooth touchdown on the runway at 7972 feet from the threshold in high winds of 360Â°/22 kt. The aircraft landed without obtaining landing clearance from the Tower controller. Landing Distance Available (LDA) for runway 21 was 9843 feet which left a remaining length of 1871 feet for the aircraft to stop. According to the captain, during landing roll, the brakes were applied while simultaneously deploying thrust reversers to maximum; all spoilers automatically deployed after the nose wheel touched the ground. The crew continued to apply brakes until maximum braking was commanded. The aircraft could not be stopped during brake application and the captain continued applying the brake pedals to maximum. The aircraft was on the centreline until it veered off left approximately 200 feet from the end of the runway, exited the paved surface and came to a stop 978 feet from the end of the runway After the aircraft came to a complete stop, engines were shut down and emergency power switch was turned ON. The emergency light came ON, all other lights were OFF and the Public Address System was not working, the lead crew had to open the cockpit door to obtain emergency evacuation instructions from the captain. Emergency evacuation was carried out using only the left forward main door and the escape slide on this door did not deploy. All persons on board were evacuated unhurt. Causal factor: The accident was caused by an underestimation of the degradation of weather conditions (heavy rain, visibility and strong wind on short final and landing) and the failure by the crew to initiate a missed approach which was not consistent with the companyÂs SOP. Contributory Factors: Other contributing factors to this accident were: - Non-compliance to companyÂs SOP in meeting crew competency and complement requirements. - Ineffective two-way communication between the ATC and DAN0363 during final approach prevented the flow of technical information on runway surface condition and other relevant meteorological information essential to safety. - Failure of the crew to crosscheck the prevailing wind and also to obtain landing clearance from the ATC during final approach after contact with ATC was restored.METAR: 19:00 UTC / 20:00 local time: METAR DNPO 201900Z 24013KT 1500 TSRA BKN006 FEW018CB 22/21 Q1006 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIB Nigeria Report number: DANA/2018/02/20/F Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: AIB Nigeria   Location  Images: photo (c) AIB Nigeria; Port Harcourt Airport (PHC); 21 February 2018 photo (c) AIB Nigeria; Port Harcourt Airport (PHC); 21 February 2018 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Weather conditions at Abbotsford at the time of departure consisted of a temperature of -2Â°C in moderate to heavy snowfall with winds of approximately 10 knots. Prior to the departure, the fuel tanks were filled to capacity and the pilot and passengers boarded the aircraft inside the operator's heated hangar. The aircraft was towed outside of the hangar without being treated with anti-ice fluid, and taxied for the departure on runway 07. Due to an inbound arrival at Abbotsford, C-GIAE was delayed for departure. Once cleared for takeoff, the aircraft had been exposed to snow and freezing conditions for approximately 13 minutes.  Approximately 4 to 5 seconds after takeoff, the pilot selected the landing gear control to the up position. As the gear retracted, the aircraft rolled approximately 30Â° to the left. To correct the uncommanded left bank, the pilot applied right aileron, and the aircraft returned to a near wings-level attitude. In order to make an immediate off-field emergency landing, the pilot retarded the power levers and then applied forward pressure on the control column to land the aircraft. The aircraft struck terrain between runway 07 and taxiway C. The aircraft slid across the snow-covered ground for approximately 760 feet before coming to rest in a raspberry patch located on the airport property. Four passengers and the pilot sustained serious injuries as a result of the accident which destroyed the aircraft. Findings as to causes and contributing factors: 1. The occurrence aircraft exited a warm hangar and was exposed to 14 minutes of heavy snow in below-freezing conditions. This resulted in a condition highly conducive to severe ground icing. 2. As the aircraft climbed out of ground effect on takeoff, it experienced an aerodynamic stall as a result of wing contamination. 3. The pilot's decision making was affected by continuation bias, which resulted in the pilot attempting a takeoff with an aircraft contaminated with ice and snow adhering to its critical surfaces. 4. The pilot and the passenger seated in the right-hand crew seat were not wearing the available shoulder harnesses. As a result, they sustained serious head injuries during the impact sequence. 5. During the impact sequence, the cargo restraint system used to secure the baggage in the rear baggage compartment failed, causing some of the baggage to injure passengers seated in the rear of the aircraft cabin.METAR: 19:27 UTC / 11:27 local time: CYXX 231927Z 08003KT 5/8SM R07/4000FT/D SN OVC007 M02/M03 A3036 RMK SN5SC3 /S02/ SLP28520:00 UTC / 12:00 local time: CYXX 232000Z VRB02KT 3/8SM R07/3000V4500FT/D SN BKN006 OVC013 M02/M03 A3034 RMK SN5SF2NS1 /S03/ SLP28020:12 UTC / 12:12 local time: CYXX 232012Z 00000KT 3/8SM R07/3000FT/N SN BKN006 OVC013 M02/M03 A3034 RMK SN5SF2NS1 SLP27820:47 UTC / 12:47 local time: CYXX 232047Z 19008KT 1/2SM R07/3000V4500FT/N SN BKN006 OVC017 M02/M03 A3031 RMK SN4SF2NS2 SLP267Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A18P0031 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: TSB A18P0031   Location  Images: photo (c) TSB Canada; Abbotsford Airport, BC (YXX); 24 February 2018 photo (c) TSB Canada; Abbotsford Airport, BC (YXX); 24 February 2018 photo (c) Transport Canada; Abbotsford Airport, BC (YXX); 23 February 2018 photo (c) TSB Canada; Abbotsford Airport, BC (YXX); 23 February 2018 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Four of the occupants received minor injuries. Findings as to causes and contributing factors - The captain continued the approach beyond the final approach fix when the reported visibility was below the approach ban minima. - During the approach, runway lighting was reduced to medium intensity, which was 30% of maximum strength, thereby reducing the probability of seeing the visual references required to conduct the landing on the runway. - The captain proceeded with the landing sequence, without seeing or knowing the length of the remaining runway ahead and unable to accurately assess the aircraftÂs position. - The aircraft landed approximately 3800 feet past the threshold, 700 feet from the end of the runway, and stopped its landing roll in a snowbank, 220 feet beyond the runway. - The deviation from standard operating procedures at a critical moment of flight was a source of confusion between the flight crew members, to the point where the aircraft was not configured for a landing, which increased the landing distance required. - The captain, focused on the landing manoeuvre and experiencing narrowed attention, was unable to make the decision to conduct a go-around. He lost the notion of time and flew over the runway for 20 seconds, not realizing that it was now impossible to touch down and come to a stop before the end of the runway. - Without policies, clear procedures and training, the first officer did not have the tools necessary to shift from a passive advisory role to proactive assertiveness strong enough to convince the captain to conduct a go-around. - The approach ban was ineffective in preventing this approach while visibility on the ground was below the minimum required for an approach ban.METAR: 15:19 UTC / 10:19 local time: CYGV 261519Z AUTO 18010G15KT 1 3/4SM -SN OVC009 M03/M04 A2985 RMK SLP11216:09 UTC / 11:09 local time: CYGV 261609Z AUTO 16004KT 1/4SM +SN VV004 M03/M03 A2984 RMK SLP10817:20 UTC / 12:20 local time: CYGV 261720Z AUTO 15004KT 1SM -SN OVC009 M02/M03 A2980 RMK SLP096Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A18Q0030 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: TSB A18Q0030   Location  Images: photo (c) TSB Canada; Havre-Saint-Pierre Airport, QC (YGV); 26 February 2018; (CC:by-nc-nd) photo (c) TSB Canada; Havre-Saint-Pierre Airport, QC (YGV); 26 February 2018; (CC:by-nc-nd) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

At 12:03 hours local time the aircraft departed Tallinn as crew training flight MYX9001. Onboard were a captain-instructor as well as a second pilot, four students and a Civil Aviation Administration inspector.  Numerous circuits and touch-and-goes were performed, including two full stop landings.  During final approach to runway 08 at 17:04, the aircraft stopped responding to flight control inputs. Altitude was lost and the aircraft hit the runway. The engines touched the runway and the main landing gear doors broke.  The aircraft then managed to gain altitude and the pilots were able to stabilize the aircraft and turn back. Both engines, however, lost power after the turn back to the airport. An emergency landing was carried out at 17:11, about 150 meters from the runway. The aircraft came to a halt in the snow 15 meters south of the runway. The flight crew members evacuated the aircraft via the L1 door emergency escape slides.  A video of the incident shows what appears to be a tire rolling away from the aircraft as it came to a stop. Photos from the scene seem to show that one of the nose landing gear tires is missing. Photos also indicate that the ram air turbine (RAT) had been deployed. Causal factors: This accident results from the combination of the following factors: - The intermittent THSA override mechanism malfunction allowing to cause the loss of pitch control by both ELACs. The repetitive triggering of the ELAC PITCH faults was caused by the non or late activations of the PTA micro-switches, which were due to the OVM piston insufficient stroke. The insufficient OVM stroke was caused by the THSA OVM clutch unit non-standard friction. The oil in the THSA OVM casing appeared to be with a higher viscosity than defined in the CMM. The higher viscosity might have reduced the friction of the OVM clutch unit, causing the THSA OVM nonstandard friction. - SEC design flaw allowing for a single event, the left landing gear temporary dedecompression, to cause the loss of pitch control by both SECs. The absence of ground spoilers arming for landing in the context of touch and go's training may have contributed to the temporary decompression of the left main landing gear. - The training instructor`s decision for continuation of the flight despite repetitive ELAC PITCH FAULT ECAM caution messages.  The lack of clear framework of operational rules for training flights, especially concerning the application of the MEL, and the specific nature of operations that caused pressure to complete the training program may have impacted the crew decision-making process. Contributory factors - Smartlynx Estonia ATO TM does not clearly define the need for arming spoilers when performing touch-and-go training (ATO procedures not in accordance with Airbus SOP). The fact that there is no clear reference in the Smartlynx Estonia ATO TM Touch-And-Go air exercise section to additional procedures that should be used, in combination with lack of understanding of the importance for arming the spoilers during this type of flights contributed to TRI making a decision to disarm the spoilers during touch and go training enabling landing gear bounce on touch down. - At the time of the event Airbus QRH did not define the maximum allowed number of resets for the flight control computers. - At the time of the event Airbus FCTM did not require to consider MEL on touch-and-go and stop-and-go training. - The oil in the THS OVM casing was with higher viscosity than defined in the CMM. The higher viscosity might have reduced the friction of the OVM clutch unit. - The aircraft maintenance documentation does not require any test of the OVM during aircraft regular maintenance checks. - Smartlynx Estonia ATO OM does not clearly specify the role in the cockpit for the Safety Pilot. The lack of task sharing during the event caused the ECAM warnings to be left unnoticed and unannounced for a long period. - The crew not resetting the ELAC 1. The fact that ELAC 1 PITCH FAULT was left unreset lead to the degradation of the redundancy of the system. Considering the remoteness of the loss control of both elevators, there is no specific crew training for MECHANICAL BACKUP in pitch during approach, landing and take-off. This condition of the aircraft occurred for the crew in a sudden manner on rotation and during training flight, where the experienced TRI is not in PF role and cannot get immediate feedback of the aircraft behaviour and condition. Despite these difficult conditions the crew managed to stabilize and land the aircraft with no major damage to the persons on board. The crew performance factors that contributed to the safe landing of the aircraft are the following: - The TRI followed the golden rule of airmanship (fly, navigate, communicate), by stabilizing the aircraft pitch by using the trim wheel and by keeping the aircraft engine power as long as possible; - The Safety Pilot started to play a role in the cockpit by assisting the TRI and student by informing them about the status of the aircraft and later on taking the role of the PM.METAR: 14:20 UTC / 16:20 local time: EETN 281420Z 07011KT 3700 SHSN DRSN SCT009 SCT013CB M12/M15 Q1043 R08/810295 NOSIG14:50 UTC / 16:50 local time: EETN 281450Z 07013KT 9000 -SHSN DRSN FEW008 BKN013 FEW015CB M13/M15 Q1043 R08/810295 NOSIG 15:20 UTC / 17:20 local time: EETN 281520Z 07012KT 9999 -SHSN DRSN FEW008 BKN013 FEW015CB M13/M15 Q1043 R08/490195 NOSIG 15:50 UTC / 17:50 local time: EETN 281550Z 09011KT 9999 -SN DRSN OVC013 M13/M15 Q1042 R08/490195 NOSIG 16:20 UTC / 18:20 local time: EETN 281620Z 09010KT 9999 -SN OVC014 M14/M16 Q1042 R08/490195 NOSIG Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ESIB Report number: A2802118 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: lentoposti.fi  delfi.lv  Plane to make emergency landing in Tallinn landed with stopped engines (news.err.ee, 14 March 2018)   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Congo. The aircraft departed Kinshasa-N'Djili Airport on a cargo flight to Lubumbashi. A training captain was seated on the right and the trainee captain on the left seat. The third pilot had the role of safety pilot. The trainee captain was on his fifth line training flight. At Lubumbashi, the crew was cleared for an instrument landing procedure for runway 07. In the pre-landing briefing, AUTO BRAKE 2 mode was selected for deceleration of the aircraft. No anomalies or technical malfunctions were reported to ATC. The weather conditions were good with calm winds. On landing, the aircraft landed in the touchdown zone according to the crew, the rollout on the runway appeared normal, and deceleration was progressive. At about 80 knots, the crew noted that the aircraft was diverging to the left of the runway centreline. The crew immediately switched to manual braking, but to no avail, the aircraft continued the skid until it went off the runway and came to a stop, leaving the right main gear on the runway. The nose landing gear, passing over the less compact shoulder, became bogged down and then broke off. The left main landing gear, with the weight of the aircraft, also dug in so that the left engine touched the ground. The aircraft sustained substantial damage in the area of the nose landing gear cage (wheel well). Contributing facts: (a) Reduction of simulator training hours for economic reasons for someone who has never performed the duties of controlling an aircraft on the ground. (b) The runway shoulders at Lubumbashi (Luano) do not have the same characteristics with regard to strength (see Annex 14 and Document 9157 Part 3). In conclusion, the actions taken on the rudder before it became ineffective must have been the cause of the aircraft's deviation from the runway centreline and the loss of control of the aircraft (LOC-G).Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BPEA Report number: BPEA/ACCID 01/2018 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Times.cd   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft departed Sharjah, UAE at 13:11 UTC on a flight to Istanbul, Turkey. The aircraft entered Tehran FIR fifteen minutes later and the Tehran ACC controller cleared the flight to climb to FL360 according to its flight plan. About 14:32, the pilot requested FL380, which was approved. Before reaching that altitude, the left and right airspeeds began to diverge by more than 10 knots. The left (captain's) airspeed indicator showed an increase while the right hand (copilot's) airspeed indicator showed a decrease. A caution aural alert notified the flight crew of the difference. Remarks by the flight crew suggested that an 'EFIS COMP MON' caution message appeared on the EICAS. As the aircraft was climbing, the crew reduced thrust to idle. Approximately 63 seconds later, while approaching FL380, the overspeed aural warning (clacker) began to sound, indicating that the indicated Mach had exceeded M 0.85. Based on the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) of the aircraft, the pilot flying should validate the IAS based on the aircraft flight manual and define the reliable Air Data Computer (ADC) and select the reliable Air Data source. The pilot did not follow this procedure and directly reduced engine power to decrease the IAS after hearing the clacker. The actual airspeed thus reached a stall condition. The copilot tried to begin reading of the 'EFIS COMP MON' abnormal procedure for three times but due to pilot interruption, she could not complete it. Due to decreasing speed, the stall aural warning began to sound, in addition to stick shaker and stick pusher activating repeatedly. The crew then should have referred to another emergency procedure to recover from the stall condition. While the stick pusher acted to pitch down the aircraft to prevent a stall condition, the captain was mistakenly assumed an overspeed situation due to the previous erroneous overspeed warning and pulled on the control column. The aircraft entered a series of pitch and roll oscillations. The autopilot was disengaged by the crew before stall warning, which ended the oscillations. Engine power began to decrease on both sides until both engines flamed out in a stall condition. From that point on FDR data was lost because the electric bus did not continue to receive power from the engine generators. The CVR recording continued for a further approximately 1 minute and 20 seconds on emergency battery power. Stall warnings, stick shaker and stick pusher activations continued until the end of the recording. The aircraft then impacted mountainous terrain. Unstable weather conditions were present along the flight route over Iran, which included moderate up to severe turbulence and icing conditions up to 45000ft. These conditions could have caused ice crystals to block the left-hand pitot tube. It was also reported that the aircraft was parked at Sharjah Airport for three days in dusty weather condition. Initially the pitot covers had not been applied. The formation of dust inside the pitot tube was considered another possibility. The Iranian investigators stated that both TSB Canada and Bombardier Inc. had some limitations to support the Iranian investigation team under U.S. and Canadian law against standard 4.6 of Annex 13 to ICAO convention. Main cause and contributing factors: The accident was caused by insufficient operational prerequisites for the management of erratic airspeed indication failure by the cockpit crew.  Contributing factors were: - The aircraft designer/manufacturer provided insufficient technical and operational guidance about airspeed malfunctions that previously occurred. - Lack of effective CRM.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Iran Report number: A961220TC-TRB Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources: Aerospacetalk.ir  Airporthaber   Location  Images: photo (c) flybyeigenheer; GenÃ¨ve-Cointrin Airport (GVA/LSGG); 08 February 2016; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) RenÃ© Verschuur; Istanbul-AtatÃ¼rk International Airport (IST/LTBA); 14 June 2013 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Prior to departure, while in radio contact with Dhaka Ground Control and the airline's Operations department, the captain shows signs that he was agitated and experiencing high levels of stress. As the aircraft was in a climb phase, the captain overheard a communication between Operations and another US-Bangla aircraft regarding the fuel onboard but the captain without verifying whether the message was meant for him or not, engaged in some unnecessary conversation with the Operations staff. The Captain's vocal pitch and language used again indicated that he was very much emotionally disturbed and experiencing high level of stress. The aircraft established its first contact with Kathmandu Control at 07:52 UTC. At 08:07 the First Officer contacted Kathmandu Control and requested descent clearance. Kathmandu Control cleared the flight to descend to FL160 with an estimated approach time of 08:26 which was acknowledged by the First Officer. At 08:10 the flight was handed over to Kathmandu Approach. At 08:11, Kathmandu Approach instructed the aircraft to descend to 13500 feet and hold over GURAS. The crew inserted the HOLD in the Flight Management System. At 08:13 Kathmandu Approach further instructed the aircraft to reduce its speed and descend to 12500 feet. Three minutes later a further descent clearance was given to 11500 feet, and the flight was cleared for a VOR approach to runway 02 maintaining minimum approach speed. Both crew members forgot to cancel the hold on the FMS as they were engaged in some unnecessary conversation. Upon reaching GURAS, the aircraft turned left to enter the holding pattern over GURAS, which was noticed by both crew members and immediately the captain made a correction. At the same time they were alerted by Approach Control. The captain immediately selected a heading of 027Â° which was just 5Â° of interception angle to intercept the desired radial of 202Â° inbound to KTM. The spot wind recorded was westerly at 28kt. The aircraft continued approach on heading mode and crossed radial 202Â° at 7 DME of KTM VOR. The aircraft then continued on the same heading of 027Â° and deviated to the right of the final approach course. Having deviated to the right of the final approach path, the aircraft reached about 2-3 NM North east of the KTM VOR and continued to fly further northeast. At 08:27, Kathmandu Tower (TWR) alerted the crew that the landing clearance was given for runway 02 but the aircraft was proceeding towards runway 20. At 08:29, Tower Controller asked the crew of their intention to which the captain replied that they would be landing on runway 02. The aircraft then made an orbit to the right. The Controller instructed the aircraft to join downwind for runway 02 and report when sighting another Buddha Air aircraft which was already on final for runway 02. The aircraft instead of joining downwind leg for runway 02, continued on the orbit to the right on a westerly heading towards Northwest of runway 20. The controller instructed the aircraft to remain clear of runway 20 and continue to hold at the present position as the Buddha Air aircraft was landing on runway 02 (from the opposite side) at that time. After the landing of the Buddha Air aircraft, the Tower Controller, at 08:32 UTC gave a choice to BS211 to land either on runway 20 or 02 but the aircraft again made an orbit to the right, this time northwest of runway 20. While continuing with the turn through a southeastern direction, the captain reported that he had the runway in sight and requested tower for clearance to land. The Tower Controller cleared the aircraft to land but when the aircraft was still turning for the runway it approached very close to the threshold of runway 20 on a westerly heading and not aligned with the runway. At 08:33:27 UTC, spotting the aircraft maneuvering at very close proximity to the ground and not aligned with the runway, the Tower Controller hurriedly cancelled the landing clearance of the aircraft by saying, ""Takeoff clearance cancelled"". Within the next 15-20 seconds, the aircraft pulled up in westerly direction and with very high bank angle turned left and flew over the western area of the domestic apron, continued on a southeasterly heading past the ATC Tower and further continued at a very low height, flew over the domestic southern apron area and finally attempted to align with the runway 20 to land. During this process, while the aircraft was turning inwards and momentarily headed towards the control tower, the tower controllers ducked down out of fear that the aircraft might hit the tower building. Missing the control tower, when the aircraft further turned towards the taxi track aiming for the runway through a right reversal turn, the tower controller made a transmission by saying, ""BS 211, I say again..."". At 08:34 UTC the aircraft touched down 1700 meters down the threshold with a bank angle of about 15 degrees and an angle of about 25 degrees with the runway axis (approximately heading Southeast) and to the left of the center line of runway 20, then veered southeast out of the runway through the inner perimeter fence along the rough down slope and finally stopped about 442 meters southeast from the first touchdown point on the runway. All four crew members (2 cockpit crew and 2 cabin crew) and 45 out of the 67 passengers onboard the aircraft were killed in the accident. Two more passengers succumbed to injury later in hospital during course of treatment. The aircraft caught fire after 6 seconds of touchdown which engulfed major portions of the aircraft. An investigation into the captain's behaviour showed that he had history of depression while serving in the Bangladesh Air Force in 1993 and was removed from active duty after evaluation by a psychiatrist. He was re-evaluated by a psychiatrist in January 2002 and was declared to be fit for flying. Examinations in successive annual medical checks were not focused on his previous medical condition of depression, possibly because this was not declared in the self-declaration form for annual medicals. During the flight the captain was irritable, tensed, moody, and aggressive at various times. He was smoking during the flight, contrary to company regulations. He also used foul language and abusive words in conversation with the junior female first officer. He was engaged in unnecessary conversation during the approach, at a time when sterile cockpit rules were in force. The captain seemed very unsecure about his future as he had submitted resignation from this company, though only verbally. He said he did not have any job and did not know what he was going to do for living. The Probable Causes: The Accident Investigation Commission determines that the probable cause of the accident is due to disorientation and a complete loss of situational awareness in the part of crewmember. Contributing to this the aircraft was offset to the proper approach path that led to maneuvers in a very dangerous and unsafe attitude to align with the runway. Landing was completed in a sheer desperation after sighting the runway, at very close proximity and very low altitude. There was no attempt made to carry out a go around, when a go around seemed possible until the last instant before touchdown on the runway. Contributing Factors: a. Improper timing of the pre-flight briefing and the commencement of the flight departure in which the operational pre-flight briefing was given in early morning but the flight departure time was around noon and there were four domestic short flights scheduled in between. b. The PIC, who was the pilot flying, seemed to be under stress due to behavior of a particular female colleague in the company and lack of sleep the preceding night. c. A very steep gradient between the crew. d. Flight crew not having practiced visual approach for runway 20 in the simulator. e. A poor CRM between the crew.METAR: 08:20 UTC / 14:05 local time: VNKT 120820Z 28008KT 240V320 6000 TS FEW015 FEW025CB SCT030 22/11 Q1015 NOSIG CB TO SE S AND SW08:50 UTC / 14:35 local time: VNKT 120850Z 26007KT 140V300 7000 FEW015 FEW025CB SCT030 BKN100 21/10 Q1015 NOSIG CB TO SE AND S Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Nepal AAIC Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: thehimalayantimes.com  nepalitimes.com  EXCLUSIVE: US-Bangla pilot was mentally stressed and reckless (kathmandupost.ekantipur.com, 27 August 2018) History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  4 September 2015 S2-AGU US-Bangla Airlines 0 Syedpur Airport (VGSD), Nilphamari min Runway excursion Location  Images: photo (c) Nepal AAIC; Kathmandu-Tribhuvan Airport (KTM); 12 March 2018 photo (c) Shadman Samee; Dhaka-Shahjalal International Airport (DAC/VGHS); 06 March 2018; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) Shadman Samee; Dhaka-Shahjalal International Airport (DAC/VGHS); February 2018; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) Ken Fielding; DÃ¼sseldorf International Airport (DUS/EDDL); 29 May 2010 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pedestrian sustained serious injuries, and the airplane sustained substantial damage. The captain, first officer, and the three passengers on board the airplane were not injured. The purpose of the flight was to provide logistical support of ICEX 2018, which involves, in part, U.S. Navy and U.K Royal Navy submarines operating beneath the frozen Arctic Ocean during a 5-week exercise. The flight used an airstrip on the sea ice that was lined on both sides with snow berms. The airstrip included one runway oriented north/south and an intersecting runway oriented east/west. Weather conditions at the time of the accident consisted of clear skies with ice pack haze. The sun was low on the horizon, resulting in shadows on the airstrip, and flat light conditions made it difficult to discern topographical features. The pedestrian reported that, just before the two pilots boarded the airplane, he told the captain that he would position himself alongside the airstrip so that he could photograph the airplane at departure. As the airplane back-taxied before takeoff, the pedestrian positioned himself clear of the airstrip and behind a 3- to 4-ft-tall snow berm. He said that, as the airplane's takeoff progressed, it did not climb as quickly as it had during previous departures and that the last thing he remembered before the collision was seeing the left wing getting lower to the ground as the airplane began a left turn and flew toward him while continuing to accelerate. A security video camera recorded the accident sequence, and the recording supported the pedestrian's account of the sequence of events. Although the captain reported that he climbed the airplane before initiating a left turn, the review of the video revealed that the flight crew operated the airplane at a low altitude and along a flightpath that placed it in dangerous proximity to the pedestrian (which was inconsistent with federal regulations) and left no margin to avoid the collision with him. A postaccident examination of the airplane revealed substantial damage to the left wing and left aileron. The pedestrian sustained a serious head and neck injuries because of the collision, and he was subsequently medevacked to Anchorage, Alaska for treatment. Probable Cause: The flight crew's improper decision to deliberately operate the airplane at low altitude and along a flightpath that resulted in a collision with a pedestrian after takeoff. Contributing to the accident was the pedestrian's proximity to the runway.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ANC18LA027 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Deadhorse, AK; March 2018 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft was performing Israir Airlines flight 6H716 from Budapest to Tel Aviv, Israel. During pushback the tow truck reportedly began emitting smoke, which supposedly entered the aircraft cabin. Cabin crew members opened the rear emergency exit(s) to allow evacuation through slides. During the evacuation, the rear slides were unstable because of the jet blast of the operating engines. Approximately 2.5 minutes passed from the opening of the slide to the shutdown of the engines. One passenger fell from the evacuation slide and suffered a serious head injury.  Causes In the course of its investigation, the IC concluded that the direct cause of the accident was the lack of communication from the cabin crew on duty in the aft galley to the rest of the crew, and identified the presence of the panic on board as an indirect cause, which was caused by the misjudgement of the origin of the smoke. In addition to those above, the IC presumes the following contributing factors: â passengersâ fatigue; â malfunction of the pushback tug; â ambiguity of the emergency procedures; â initiation of an evacuation without approval; â late reaction of the flight crew to the situation.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Hungary Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 years and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: http://airportal.hu/veszcsuszdakon-uritettek-ki-egy-repulogepet-ferihegyen/  https://mno.hu/belfold/sulyos-incidens-a-ferihegyen-2455450  http://www.kbsz.hu/j25/hu/legi-kozlekedes/kbsz-altal-vizsgalt-esemenyek-2014/22-legi-kozlekedes/legi-kozlekedes/2344-20180323 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  7 June 2009 D-AHLR Hapag-Lloyd 0 S of Aosta min Fumes/smoke/odor event 12 March 2013 OK-TVP Travel Service Airlines 0 Katowice Int'l Airport- KTW/EPKT, Pyrzowice non Runway excursion Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates23-Mar-2018 12:19 bbmaci Added 23-Mar-2018 12:26 harro Updated [Aircraft type, Cn, Operator, Location, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, ]23-Mar-2018 12:28 harro Updated [Embed code, ]02-May-2023 20:09 harro Updated 17-Jul-2023 08:05 harro Updated Corrections or additions? ...

The pilot reported that, after exiting instrument meteorological conditions during a circling approach, he was ""a little above"" the normal glidepath; as the airplane crossed the approach end of the runway, the airplane began to sink rapidly and drift to the left. He added power to initiate a go-around, but the airplane continued to sink and landed with the left main landing gear off the left side of the runway. As the airplane became airborne again, he attempted to retract the landing gear, ""but the handle was locked in place."" He noticed that the left and right main landing gear extension lights were illuminated, but the nose landing gear light was not. The pilot noticed a positive rate of climb and decided to fly to King Salmon Airport, Alaska. The pilot reported that, while en route to the alternate airport, a passenger reported that they smelled smoke, so he turned off electrical equipment. A pilot-rated passenger assisted with circuit breaker troubleshooting before turning on the battery again for communications. He instructed the pilot-rated passenger to visually examine the landing gear; the passenger reported that the left main landing gear was extended without damage and the right main landing gear was ""bent back,"" with damage to the right flap with fuel leaking from the wing.  After contacting the alternate airport's tower, the pilot reported that he declared an emergency and provided a safety brief to the passengers. He added that, at the alternate airport, he performed an instrument landing system approach, and over the approach end of the runway, he reduced power, feathered the propellers, and moved both fuel levers to fuel cutoff. During landing, the right main landing gear collapsed, the right wing settled onto the runway, and the airplane began to pull to the right. The pilot added left rudder to maintain the runway centerline and the airplane came to rest on the runway. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing. Probable Cause and Findings: The pilot's failure to maintain an adequate approach path and runway centerline during the initial landing, which resulted in a hard landing to the left of the runway and damage to the landing gear and wing.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: GAA18CA187 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  KTVA   Location  Images: photo (c) Alaska Department of Transportation; King Salmon Airport, AK (AKN/PAKN); 29 March 2018 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Arriving on final approach at the airport, the limited visibility prompted the crew to carry out a go-around and divert to Bamako. In the early afternoon, judging that the conditions were improving, the crew took off again and made it to the final approach on the laterite runway 07R of Gao.  With visibility reduced to 3,000 metres and the runway difficult to spot, the crew requested Gao air traffic control to mark the runway threshold with flashing lights. The crew only perceived this secondary runway late and made corrections to line up on the runway axis on short final. As a result, the approach was not stabilized. This unstable final approach resulted in a late and poorly controlled flare. The aircraft touched down on the runway and bounced back three times. One or more of these contacts with the runway produced excessive forces on the nose gear and its fracture. The aircraft slid over the front of the fuselage for 500 metres before coming to rest. The crew shut down the engines and systems, then evacuated the aircraft on their own. Causes of the event The causes of this event are environmental, organizational and human factors. The following factors contributed to the late detection of the active runway: - reduced visibility conditions due to haze (less than 3,000 metres); - the absence of contrast of the laterite runway with the surrounding terrain; - the lack of effectiveness of portable lighting installed at the runway threshold at the crew's request. The following factors contributed to an unstable final approach and a late and poorly controlled flare: - the focus of attention on the landing, leading to a poorly executed landing without a go-around; - operational pressure to deliver fresh food on time; - the emulation induced by the performance of another crew from the same company who may have landed earlier in Gao under the same conditions; - the fatigue accumulated by the sequence of flights and the weather conditions, which are conducive to errors of judgment and delays in decision-making; - the organisation of the cockpit not promoting synergy within the crew.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA-E Report number: E-2018-003-I Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The private pilot and passenger of the Cessna 150 sustained fatal injuries and the pilot and 4 passengers of the Cessna 525 were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed in the area. The Cessna 150 was departing on runway 15 at MZZ a local VFR personal flight and the Cessna 525 was landing on runway 22 after an IFR flight that originated from Jackson, Michigan, USA. Examination of the accident site showed that the Cessna 150 had struck the empennage of the Cessna 525 at the intersection of runways 15 and 22. Evidence at the intersection showed that the airplanes came together perpendicular to each other. The Cessna 150 then impacted the ground and a post-crash fire ensued. The Cessna 525 continued to roll out on runway 22.  Witnesses stated that they heard the Cessna 150 pilot on runway 15 UNICOM frequency. The surviving pilot of the Cessna 525 stated that he did not see the departing Cessna 150 while he was on a straight-in approach to runway 22, nor did he see the 150 during the landing roll. He stated that he did not recall making a radio call on UNICOM, but did utilize his on board Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) system while on approach. He stated that the TCAS did not show any traffic on the airport.  The reported weather at MZZ at the time of the accident was VFR with 4 miles of visibility due to haze. Also, at the departure and arrival ends of runway 15/33, there was a sign stating, ""Traffic Using Runway 4/22 Cannot Be Seen, Monitor Unicom 122.7."" At the departure and arrival ends of runway 4/22, there was a sign stating, ""Traffic Using 15/33 cannot Be Seen, Monitor Unicom 122.7."" The MZZ airport does not have a control tower. Probable Cause: The failure of both pilots to see and avoid the other airplane as they converged on intersecting runways. Contributing to the accident was the jet pilot's not monitoring the airport's traffic advisory frequency, known reduced visibility of the intersecting runways, and hazy weather condition.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN18FA132B Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources: theindychannel.com  WTHR   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Marion Municipal Airport, IN (MZZ); April 2018; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Marion Municipal Airport, IN (MZZ); April 2018; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Marion Municipal Airport, IN (MZZ); April 2018; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Marion Municipal Airport, IN (MZZ); April 2018; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Marion Municipal Airport, IN (MZZ); April 2018; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft skidded 278 m along the runway before it came to rest. The aircraft carried medical isotopes for a hospital. The crew was uninjured, while the aircraft suffered damage to the nose wheel mechanism, both propellers, belly and the trailing edge of the flaps. The crew explained that the landing gear collapsed when the aircraft landed. They experienced that the aircraft banked slightly to the left just after landing and the commander, who was PM (Pilot Monitoring), reacted by placing his hand on the landing gear handle to check if it was completely down. Furthermore, he explained that he retracted the handle in a reflex action, but quickly placed it down again. According to the crew, this led the landing gear to retract resulting in the aircraft taking the ground with its belly.  The NSIA has attempted to find a link between the crew's explanation and the investigation findings, but without finding a complete match. A thorough inspection of the landing gear was carried out after the accident without any significant technical issues located in the system. The NSIA believes that the landing gear was either in transit when they landed or that it was completely retracted, which resulted in a belly landing.METAR: 07:50 UTC / 09:50 local time: METAR ENZV 090750Z 17009KT 3000 DZ BR OVC003 06/05Q10067 TEMPO 1400 -DZ BR=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIBN Report number: 2021/13 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NRK  AIBN  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The plane landed safely at the second approach 15 minutes later. No personal injuries were reported.  The aircraft departed Jeju, South Korea at 20:24 hours with the captain as Pilot Flying on the leg to Osaka-Kansai. The landing briefing commenced at around 20:59 prior to the descent did not include information regarding a tailwind at the time of the landing. As the aircraft had commenced the ILS approach to runway 06L, the controller reported wind from 030Â° at 3 kt. Both the autopilot and the auto-throttle of the aircraft were disengaged at around a radio altitude of 1,200 ft. In addition, the aircraft continued a stabilized approach. The captain, who was assuming that a landing would be made with a tailwind component, planned to put the thrust levers to their idle position earlier than usual when performing a flare in order to prevent that a touchdown would be long down on the runway. At around 21:32:54, the captain moved the thrust levers to their idle position along with initiating the flare at 2Â° pitch angle at a radio altitude of about 30 ft. Although the captain tried to continue raising the nose and to reduce the rate of descent, the timing of such maneuvers was slightly delayed. Reducing the rate of descent was infeasible because the thrust levers had already been set to their idle position. The captain tried to reduce the rate of descent of the aircraft by pulling the control column further. The first officer, who felt the rate of descent was large, pulled the control column to reduce the rate of descent without making any call-out. Having noticed the operation of the FO, the captain kept the control column so as to follow the FO's operation. At around 21:32:57, the right main landing gear of the aircraft touched down at pitch angle of about 3.5Â°, and all spoilers began to deploy when the auto speed brake was activated. Subsequently, after the left main landing gear had touched down, the aircraft bounced. The maximum vertical acceleration recorded in the FDR during this period was 1.87 G. The captain, who was unable to predict the degree of the bounce and assumed that the impact accompanied by the touchdown after the bounce would be hard, executed a go-around maneuver. The pitch angle of the aircraft immediately before executing the go-around was about 5Â°. The aircraft started climbing positively at about 10Â° pitch angle after its both main landing gears touched down again approximately one second after it had executed the go-around.  The aircraft landed on runway 06L conducting the ILS approach again after flying in accordance with the missed approach procedure. Both the flight crew members did not recognize that the aircraft had struck the runway until the scratch marks were found on the lower aft fuselage by mechanics after the aircraft arrived at the allotted parking spot. The scrape mark on the runway was 15 meters long. PROBABLE CAUSES In this accident, it is highly probable that the lower aft fuselage of the aircraft was damaged with contacting the runway because its pitch angle became too high during the go-around following the bounce at the time of the landing. Regarding the pitch angle became too high, it is somewhat likely that because the Captain, who thought the impact after the bounce would become hard and tried to avoid the second touchdown, performed large nose up maneuver.METAR: 12:30 UTC / 21:33 local time: RJBB 091230Z 01003KT 9999 FEW030 BKN045 13/08 Q1020 NOSIG=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JTSB Report number: AA2019-5 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: https://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl?a=20180410-00000039-jij-soci  https://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl?a=20180410-00050070-yom-soci  Flightradar24   Location  Images: photo (c) JTSB; Osaka-Kansai International Airport (KIX/RJBB); 09 April 2018 photo (c) Flightradar24; Osaka-Kansai International Airport (KIX); 09 April 2018 photo (c) JTSB; Osaka-Kansai International Airport (KIX/RJBB); 09 April 2018 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot, the only occupant onboard, sustained minor injuries, and the airplane sustained substantial damage. The airplane was being operated by Hageland Aviation Services, Inc., as a Ravn Connect cargo/mail flight. The flight originated about 07:58, from the Utqiagvik (formerly Barrow) Airport, Alaska, and it was destined for Atqasuk, which is located about 58 miles south. The area between Utqiagvik and Atqasuk consists of remote, flat, featureless, tundra-covered terrain, which is snow-covered in April. Weather conditions at the time of departure consisted of clear skies, 9 miles visibility, and a light wind. After takeoff, the airplane climbed to 2,500 feet msl, and proceeded southbound towards Atqasuk. The pilot said that as the airplane neared Atqasuk, with the autopilot engaged, the airplane descended to about 1,500 feet msl, but then he noticed an area of low fog around Atqasuk. He said that when the airplane was about two miles from the airport, he heard the audible autopilot disengagement annunciator tone sound, which was immediately followed by the pilot's control column pitching forward. The pilot said that he was unable to pull the control column back, and the airplane subsequently descended into instrument meteorological conditions. He said that the airplane continued to descend into the fog, then it struck the snow-covered tundra, and nosed over. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the wings, fuselage, and empennage. A North Slope Borough Search and Rescue helicopter pilot told the NTSB that while en route from Utqiagvik to the accident site he encountered ice fog, reduced visibility, and flat light conditions that made it difficult to discern topographical features on the snow-covered tundra. He noted that as the flight continued, both pilots noticed ice beginning to accumulate on the helicopter's windscreen, so the decision was made to abort the search and rescue flight, and the helicopter returned to Utqiagvik. A search team from Atqasuk eventually reached the accident site on snow machines and transported the pilot to Atqasuk.

While on the take off roll, a stone apparently impacted the horizontal stabilizer. The pilot proceeded to bring the aircraft to a stop, shut down the engine and disembarked the passengers.  Based on his own assessment of the damage, he elected to fly the aircraft to what he considered the nearest safest place the next morning. He departed El Barde at 06:25 on April 12 and landed in Wajir Airport at 08:15. He states that upon landing, he inspected the aircraft and realized the damage had become more pronounced.

A fire ensued. The pilot, who was the sole occupant, died in the crash. Night instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident, and no flight plan was filed for the flight, which departed Richmond-Chesterfield County Airport (FCI), Virginia, about 20:35 and was destined for Shenandoah Valley Regional Airport (SHD), Virginia. According to a friend of the pilot, the pilot had ""a couple of drinks"" while they were preparing dinner. The pilot left her home about 19:30. The pilot's friend thought that the pilot would be going to a hotel because it was getting dark, but FCI security video showed that the pilot arrived at the airport at 20:02 and walked to the airplane at 20:04. The pilot then walked around the airplane for about 3 minutes, boarded the airplane, closed the main cabin door, and initiated the engine start sequence at 20:17. About 2 minutes later, the airplane began to taxi to the departure end of runway 15 and then taxied back to the departure end of runway 33. The takeoff roll began on runway 33 at 20:33. The airport security video showed the windsock, which indicated that the wind favored a departure from runway 15. According to an airport line service employee, the airplane departed with a tailwind. The employee also stated that the pilot did not communicate on the Unicom frequency. According to air traffic control data provided by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), a radar target identified as the accident airplane departed FCI and reached a maximum altitude of about 11500 ft mean sea level (msl) at 20:40. The airplane then began to descend and, at 20:44, leveled off at an altitude of about 4300 ft (which was below the minimum safe altitude of 5700 ft msl for SHD). The airplane remained at 4300 ft until 20:53, when it began a descending left turn. The last two radar returns were 5 seconds apart and showed the airplane at 3300 ft and 2800 msl, which indicated that the airplane was descending about 6000 ft per minute. Radar contact was lost at 20:54. Throughout the flight, the pilot did not have any contact with air traffic control. The FAA prohibits any person from acting or as a crewmember of a civil aircraft while having 0.040 gm/dl or more ethanol in the blood. In addition, the regulation states that no person can act as a crewmember of an aircraft within 8 hours after the consumption of any alcoholic beverage. Probable cause: ""The pilot's loss of control while operating in night instrument meteorological conditions as a result of spatial disorientation. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's decision to operate an airplane after consuming alcohol and his resulting intoxication, which degraded the pilot's judgment and decision-making.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA18FA127 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  cavalierdaily.com   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Crozet, VA; 16 April 2018; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Crozet, VA; 16 April 2018; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Crozet, VA; 16 April 2018; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Crozet, VA; 15 April 2018; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The forecast weather at Newquay was for overcast cloud at 400 - 500 ft with a gusty crosswind of approximately 20 kt. The co-pilot was pilot flying for the Newquay sector. The takeoff, cruise and descent were uneventful. During the cruise the commander obtained updated weather via the ATIS for Newquay, which gave landing runway 12, the surface wind 210/16 and cloud broken at 400 ft. The flight crew briefed for the approach, discussing the threat of turbulence on final and the potential for a go-around. The pilots planned to use flap 15 for the final approach because no gusts were reported on the ATIS, and to set the propeller condition levers to max in case a go-around was required. The aircraft was established on final for runway 12 at 8 nm and the co-pilot disconnected the autopilot at approximately 500 ft. At approximately 400 ft, the aircraft became displaced from the runway centreline and the co-pilot elected to go around. The goaround was uneventful and the aircraft was repositioned for a second approach. During the downwind leg the commander made a PA to reassure the passengers then briefed the co-pilot to keep the autopilot engaged until slightly later in the approach and to ensure the speed remained between the VREF and VCLIMB speed bugs. The second approach was stable until approximately 50 ft. The tower gave the surface wind as 190Â°/20 kt. At approximately 50 ft the co-pilot reduced power to flight idle to control the airspeed, although neither pilot was aware that the power had been reduced this much. At approximately 30 ft above the runway, the aircraft started to sink rapidly and the commander called ""power, power, power"". The co-pilot increased power and pitched up to arrest the rate of descent, but the aircraft landed firmly, striking its tail on the runway. The aircraft bounced and the commander took control. Observing the ÂTOUCHED RUNWAYÂ light he elected to continue the landing. The aircraft landed and taxied to the gate without further incident. Subsequently one cabin crew member reported minor back pain. No other injuries were reported. Damage was found to several skin panels, frames, stringers and aft pressure bulkhead. Conclusion: ""The tailstrike occurred because the pilot flying reacted instinctively to the high sink rate by increasing pitch attitude and power, rather than increasing power only. The aircraft manufacturer recommends that operators provide annual recurrent training in pitch awareness for flight crew to establish the correct response to high sink rate near the ground.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: EW/G2018/04/09 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  4 January 2014 G-JECX Flybe 0 Paris-Orly Airport (ORY/LFPO) unk Hydraulic system problem Images: photo (c) AAIB; Newquay-Cornwall Airport (NQY/EGHQ); April 2018 photo (c) NTSB; Newquay-Cornwall Airport (NQY/EGHQ); 17 April 2018 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft, a Boeing 737-700, originated from New York-La Guardia Airport at 10:43 for a flight to Dallas-Love Field, Texas. About 11:04, when the aircraft was climbing through FL325, the no.1 engine (CFM56-7B24) suffered an uncontained failure. The flight crew noticed that the no.1 engine rpm dropped to zero, as did the oil pressure. The cabin altitude horn sounded and the aircraft experienced a sudden, uncommanded, left roll of a 41Â° bank angle. The pilots leveled the wing, donned their oxygen masks and initiated an emergency descent. The flight crew then requested air traffic control to give them vectors to the nearest suitable airport. As a result of the uncontained failure, a fan blade and parts of the engine cowling and engine air inlet cowl had separated. Debris impacted a window frame of row 14, causing the window and frame to break away. This resulted in a decompression of the aircraft. Additional debris impacted and damaged the leading edge of the left hand wing. The flight was vectored towards Philadelphia Airport, where the crew requested an extended final approach due to concerns of aircraft controllability. It was decided to land with flaps 5 for that reason, and an approach speed of 165 knots. The aircraft landed on runway 27L at 11:19 hours and the aircraft was stopped on a taxiway. ARFF services attended to the no.1 engine while injured passenger who was seated near the lost window was rushed to hospital. The passenger is reported to have died. Preliminary findings of the NTSB show that the no.13 fan blade of engine no.1 was missing. It appears to have broken away at the hub. There is evidence of metal fatigue in the area where the blade broke. Also, a part of the no.1 engine cowling was reported to have been found at Burnville, PA. Probable Cause: The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determines that the probable cause of this accident was a low-cycle fatigue crack in the dovetail of fan blade No. 13, which resulted in the fan blade separating in flight and impacting the engine fan case at a location that was critical to the structural integrity and performance of the fan cowl structure. This impact led to the in-flight separation of fan cowl components, including the inboard fan cowl aft latch keeper, which struck the fuselage near a cabin window and caused the window to depart from the airplane, the cabin to rapidly depressurize, and the passenger fatality.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NTSB/AAR-19/03 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Philadelphia International Airport, PA (PHL/KPHL); 17 April 2018; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Philadelphia International Airport, PA (PHL/KPHL); 17 April 2018; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Philadelphia International Airport, PA (PHL/KPHL); 17 April 2018; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Philadelphia International Airport, PA (PHL/KPHL); 17 April 2018; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; near  Burnville, PA; 18 April 2018; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; near  Burnville, PA; 18 April 2018; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Philadelphia International Airport, PA (PHL/KPHL); April 2018; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Philadelphia International Airport, PA (PHL/KPHL); 2018; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Philadelphia International Airport, PA (PHL/KPHL); 2018; (publicdomain) photo (c) Flightaware/Google; 17 April 2018 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft, an Airbus A330-323, had taken off from runway 26L at en route to London, U.K. The flight crew reported a no. 2 engine fire electronic centralized aircraft monitor (ECAM) indication at about 500 feet AGL, declared an emergency, shutdown the no. 2 engine, discharged both fire bottles, and initiated an air turn back to the departure airport. During the return the fire warning indication cleared, and the airplane made an uneventful overweight single engine landing on runway 27R at 18:34.  After landing, airport rescue and firefighting (ARFF) crews met the airplane on the runway and observed smoke and flames emanating from the no. 2 engine. ARFF sprayed the engine with fire retardant foam and extinguished the fire. The airplane was towed to the gate and the passengers disembarked. There were no injuries to the passengers or crew and the airplane sustained substantial damage. Probable Cause: The flight crewÂs delayed landing after an in-flight engine fire, which reignited after both fire bottles were discharged and resulted in substantial damage to an engine pylon. Contributing to the delayed landing was likely the flight crewÂs perception that the fire had been extinguished due to the disappearance of the primary engine fire warning indications after the fire detection loops were damaged and that a landing as soon as possible was not perceived to be necessary. Contributing to the duration of the fire was the contamination of an engine fire isolation system component which resulted in hydraulic fluid leaking into the designated engine fire zone after the engine was shutdown and the fire button was pressed.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA18LA163 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 years Download report:  Final report Sources: KCTV5  Flightradar24   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The Boeing 737-800 registered PK-LOO operated on a flight from Sultan Hasanuddin International Airport, Makassar. The Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as Pilot Flying (PF) and the Second in Command (SIC) acted as Pilot Monitoring (PM) on this flight. On board the flight were 181 persons, consisted of two pilots, five flight attendants and 174 passengers. The flight departed Makassar at 17:28 local time and cruised at an altitude of FL330. The flight until descent was uneventful. Prior to commencing their descent, the crew received the latest weather information from the Jalaluddin Tower controller: wind calm, visibility 2,500 meters, slight rain, cloud FEW CB (cumulonimbus) 800 feet and overcast 800 feet, temperature 26Â°C, dew point 24 Â°C, QNH 1008 hPa and QFE 1006 hPa with additional remarks of CB in the approach area. During the descent, at 18:28, Jalaluddin Tower advised the pilot to descend to 5,800 feet and issued a clearance to carry out a VOR/DME approach to runway 27. At 18:32, the Jalaluddin Tower controller informed the pilot that there was rain over the field and requested the aircrafts position. The PM acknowledged the information and reported that the aircraft was on final course runway 27. One minute later a pilot of an ATR aircraft that previously landed informed to JT892 that when they were making the approach, there was heavy rain in the final approach area. The PM acknowledged the information. There was no pilot discussion to anticipate the reported heavy rain. The Jalaluddin Tower controller informed the pilot that the wind direction was 150Â° with velocity of 7 knots, QNH 1008 hPa and issued landing clearance if the pilot was able to see the runway. The PM acknowledged the message and would inform when they were able to see the runway. The pilot requested for high intensity of runway lights and was informed that the runway light had been set to maximum intensity. At 18:34, the PM informed the Jalaluddin Tower controller that the runway was in sight. The Jalaluddin Tower controller then issued landing clearance for JT892 since the controller was able to see the aircraft landing lights. At 18:40, the aircraft touched down, the autobrake operated, the spoiler automatically deployed and the PF selected the engine thrust reversers. The pilots felt that suddenly the rain became very heavy and they were only able to see the runway lights on the left side of the runway. The crew felt an impact and then the aircraft stopped off the left side of the runway at approximately 1,200 meters from the beginning runway 27. The pilot attempted to contact the Jalaluddin Tower controller but this was not received by the controller. The Jalaluddin Tower controller also attempted to contact the pilot, but the pilot did not receive the controllers message. The Jalaluddin Tower controller could not clearly see the aircraft position however, the controller aware that the aircraft experienced an abnormality. The controller notified the Airport rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) using radio because the crash bell had not been connected to the ARFF station since the ARFF station moved to the new location a few months before.

The crew requested to ""push and hold"" which was granted by the ground controller who added, ""push across to the east line, abeam stand 50R. do not start engines"". These instructions were repeated to the groundcrew. During the pushback, ATC informed the crew of a new CTOT, very close to the present time. The crew informed the groundcrew and advised them that they would start engines after the pushback. Approaching the end of the pushback, the flight crew felt the tug stop abruptly. The commander asked the groundcrew if everything was alright and the groundcrew responded that they had pushed the aircraft too close to the blast fence and were going to pull it forward. The Senior Cabin Crew member called the flight deck on the interphone and informed them that she and the cabin crew seated at the rear of the aircraft felt that the tail of the aircraft had struck something. The commander checked with the groundcrew, who thought it hadnÂt, but the commander contacted engineering who sent out an engineer. On inspection, damage was found to the trailing edge of the left elevator. The commander called the ground controller and informed  them of the collision. The Fire Service attended and, following an inspection, determined that there was no immediate danger to the aircraft or passengers, which was also confirmed by the engineer. The aircraft was towed to Stand 50L and the passengers disembarked using the air stairs. Discussion The clearance was to carry out a pushback of the aircraft to abeam Stand 50R and the headset operator believed this would be when the pilotÂs window was in line with the stand. The pushback continued until the elevator struck the blast fence but the relative positions of the pilotÂs window and the stand were not determined at this point. The poor weather, light and poor clarity of the taxi line as seen by the tug driver meant that all his attention was focussed on his task.

The first officer, who was line flying under supervision, was Pilot Flying while the captain, who had a Flight Instructor Rating, was Pilot Monitoring on the flight. The flight was uneventful, the weather conditions were favourable, and the crew requested a visual approach for a landing on runway 10 at Marrakech, which was received at 5NM from the ODALO point, allowing the crew to have a long final approach of about 20NM before landing. The ILS frequency was selected for both pilots, while the FD was switched off when the clearance was received for a visual approach. At 200ft agl the aircraft was below glide path, the first officer corrected by increasing thrust without controlling the vertical path being, causing the aircraft to be high on the glide path. The trainee first officer then reduced thrust (almost to idle) to catch up with the glide path by descending to the runway at 100 feet above ground level, with a very high descent rate. It was at this point that the instructor pilot had to make a decision to either take control to correct the course, or abort the landing and do a go-around as the approach was no longer stabilised and the first officer's corrections were excessive. As the first officer had 500 hours on the type, the captain decided not to take control. Thrust was increased to decrease the rate of descent. The aircraft then made a hard landing with bounce. When the wheels touched the ground during the landing, the captain finally decided to take control. He also decided to reduce thrust further, to avoid a long landing after the bounce. As the aircraft was at a higher height than the recommended flare height, this manoeuvre was poorly executed with a nose-up attitude exceeding the values required for a safe landing. Despite the pilot's action on the control column to remedy the situation, this did not prevent the aft fuselage from contacting the runway. Probable causes of the accident: - Inappropriate execution of the landing procedure by the flight crew; - Inappropriate correction by the first officer to catch up with the landing path;  - Delayed reaction by the captain to rectify the situation;  - Inadequate response by the first officer to the landing procedure; - Late reaction by captain to remedy this situation; - Inadequate decision by the captain to continue the landing. Contributing factors: - Lack of experience in the first officer; - Unfamiliar terrain for the first officer; - Lack of experience of the Type Rating Instructor pilot.METAR: 12:00 UTC /  local time: GMMX 021200Z 36004KT 310V090 9999 FEW020 18/06 Q1017 NOSIG=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Maroc Report number: D.BEA.002.AIG/01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  28 August 2019 OO-JAY TUI fly Belgium 0 Eindhoven Airport, Noord-Brabant min 27 February 2023 OO-JAY TUI fly Belgium, opf TUI fly Netherlands 0 Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS/EHAM) unk Tailstrike Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates17-Oct-2024 18:19 ASN Updated [Cn, Source, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All nine occupants suffered fatal injuries. The aircraft was attached to the Puerto Rico Air National Guard and had been undergoing routine maintenance in Savannah before heading to the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG) at Davis Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona. The MA had been at Savannah for almost a month, since 9 April 2018, to undergo prescheduled fuel cell maintenance and unscheduled work on engine number one by 156 AW maintenance personnel using the facilities of the 165th Airlift Wing.  During takeoff roll, engine no.1 RPM fluctuated and did not provide normal RPM when the captain advanced the throttle lever into the flight range for takeoff. Approximately eight seconds prior to aircraft rotation, engine no.1 RPM and torque significantly decayed, which substantially lowered thrust. The fluctuation on roll and significant performance decay went unrecognized by the crew until rotation, when the captain commented on aircraft control challenges and the aircraft veered left and nearly departed the runway into the grass before it achieved flight.  As the crew retracted the landing gear, they identified the engine no.1 RPM and torque malfunction and the captain called for engine shutdown. However, the crew failed to complete the Takeoff Continued After Engine Failure procedure, the Engine Shutdown procedure, and the After Takeoff checklist as directed by the Flight Manual, and the aircraft's flaps remained at 50 percent. Additionally, the captain banked left into the inoperative engine, continued to climb, and varied left and right rudder inputs. At an altitude of approximately 900 feet mean sea level and 131 knots indicated air speed, the captain input over nine degrees of left rudder, the aircraft skidded left, the left wing stalled, and the aircraft departed controlled flight and impacted the terrain on Georgia State Highway 21. USAF AIB CONCLUSION: ""After a comprehensive investigation into this mishap, I find, by a preponderance of the evidence, the cause of the mishap was MP1Âs improper application of left rudder, which resulted in a subsequent skid below three-engine minimum controllable airspeed, a left-wing stall, and the MAÂs departure from controlled flight. Additionally, I find, by a preponderance of the evidence, the MCÂs failure to adequately prepare for emergency actions, the MCÂs failure to reject the takeoff, the MCÂs failure to properly execute appropriate after takeoff and engine shutdown checklists and procedures, and the Mishap MaintainersÂ failure to properly diagnose and repair engine number one substantially contributed to the mishap.""METAR: 14:53 UTC / 10:53 local time: KSAV 021453Z VRB06KT 10SM FEW035 FEW250 24/14 A3035 RMK AO2 SLP277 T02440139 5300915:33 UTC / 11:33 local time: KSAV 021533Z 04008KT 10SM FEW035 FEW250 26/14 A3035 RMK AO2 T0256013915:53 UTC / 11:53 local time: KSAV 021553Z VRB03KT 10SM FEW015 FEW035 SCT250 26/14 A3034 RMK AO2 SLP274 FU FEW015 T02560139Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: USAF AIB Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: WBTV   Location  Images: photo (c) IAFF574 Savannah; Port Wentworth, GA; 02 May 2018 photo (c) USAF; Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport, GA (SAV); 02 May 2018 photo (c) USAF; near Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport, GA (SAV); 02 May 2018 photo (c) USAF; Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport, GA (SAV); 02 May 2018 photo (c) USAF; Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport, GA (SAV); 02 May 2018 photo (c) USAF; Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport, GA (SAV); 02 May 2018 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

Medical assistance was requested via ATC. The aircraft landed normally at the destination airport.   The presence of the area of severe turbulence close to the Alps over Northern Italy was foreseen and represented on the flight documentation available to the crew. The captain had briefed the cabin crew as such. After numerous calls on frequency from crews of other aircraft that were passing through the turbulence area, the captain reiterated to the CCM4, who had entered the cabin, the presence of the turbulence area. The captain then warned the passengers to return to their seats and activated the seat belt sign. Shortly before the encounter with the turbulence, the captain warned a cabin crew member, via intercom, that the crew had to sit down due to the impending turbulence. During entry into the area of severe turbulence, the FDR recorded maximum vertical acceleration values of -1.20 G and + 2.76 G, with a maximum variation of + 3.96 G.  The flight controls remained in normal law without any degradation of the control mode. AP and A / THR remained regularly engaged throughout the period in which the aircraft was affected by the turbulence. During the severe turbulence, the cabin crew were each still not secured in their seats. Three cabin crew members were injured (SCCM, CCM2 and CCM3). The cabin crew members were initially taken to Verona hospital for first aid. The SCCM, who suffered a fractured leg, was later transferred to the UK for surgery. CCM2 suffered a contusion injury to the left hemi-costat. CCM3 sustained a lacerated contusion wound to the scalp.

Once the passengers had left, the flight crew put covers on the engines and external sensors. The next planned flight was a positioning flight on 4 January 2018, to Ekaterinburg, Russia, without passengers. The crew arrived at the airport to prepare for the flight at approximately 15:00. Take-off, as per the flight plan, was to happen at 17:00. The ground handling company transported them to the aircraft by bus at approximately 15:20. The captain opened the door at which time the cabin assistant entered the cabin. The captain and the co-pilot placed their flight bags behind the cockpit and went back outside. The co-pilot placed the aircrew's baggage into the rear baggage compartment which opens from the outside. The captain and the co-pilot removed the engine covers which they had put in place on the day of their arrival. These were put into their own storage bags and also placed in the baggage compartment. Following this, the captain went into the cockpit and started the APU, which generates electricity for aircraft systems and bleed air for heating the cabin. The co-pilot began to brush off the snow that had fallen on the aircraft. A moment later the captain came out to help the co-pilot. At first, he worked with his bare hands. Due to the extremely cold conditions (-22Â°C), however, he went back inside to fetch a pair of gloves. When he came back out, he closed the door. A little later the cabin assistant inside the cabin felt strange pressure in her ears and chest. She went into the cockpit and attempted to get the attention of the pilots working outside by knocking on the window. The pilots noticed the knocking and the captain went to open the door. According to the co-pilotÂs observations it was unusually difficult for the captain to get the door open. Then, the captain pulled harder on the door handle at which time the door blew open with excessive force, hitting the captain who was standing underneath the door and knocking him to the ground. The pressure wave also knocked the co-pilot down, who had been standing approximately one metre from the left side of the door. The co-pilot stood up and saw the captain lying on his back on the ground. Realising that the captain was unconscious, the co-pilot turned him on his side. Then he entered the cabin and saw the cabin assistant in a semi-seated position on the floor of the cabin. The co-pilot shook the assistantÂs shoulder and advised her to go outside.  The captain died as a result of the serious injuries he sustained at the site of the occurrence. The co-pilot had not sustained any physical injuries. The cabin assistant had bruises on her right arm, continued to feel chest pain and was diagnosed with a mild concussion.  The cabin sustained substantial damage. The cockpitÂs aft left bulkhead and the cabinÂs forward left bulkhead were nearly torn off. CONCLUSIONS: 1. When the aircraft is parked outside for a longer period, some pilots may close the outflow valve to prevent the ingestion of contaminants into the valve, or upstream into the cabin. 2. When the APU is being run one must check that the outflow valve is fully open. If it is not possible to ensure that the valve is open or to remove differential pressure by other means, the door must not be closed. 3. The door had no indication warning of excessive cabin pressure, nor an opening for depressurisation. The cabin was pressurised because the APU bleed air was ducted into the cabin, the outflow valve was closed and the door was also closed. Significant differential pressure existed between the cabin and the outside. 4. Cabin pressurisation on the ground also creates a hazard for several other groups of professionals, such as aircraft mechanics, ground handling staff, aircraft cargo loaders and rescue personnel.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIB Finland Report number: L2018-01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) Safety Investigation Authority, Finland; KittilÃ¤ Airport (KTT0; 04 January 2018 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

WestJet flight 2425, a Boeing 737-800 registered C-FDMB, landed on runway 24R at 17:39 hours local time following a flight from CancÃºn, Mexico. The flight taxied to Terminal 3 and was stopped with the engines and APU running, on Taxi-lane 2 on the north side of Pier B. The flight crew were waiting for ground personnel to marshal the aircraft into position at Gate B12. The WestJet aircraft was positioned directly behind and perpendicular to a Sunwing Airlines Boeing 737-800 (C-FPRP), which was parked at Gate B13.  The Sunwing aircraft was being prepared to be towed to another location at the airport. A Sunwing maintenance technician was in the cockpit of C-FPRP, and the aircraft's APU was running. Two ground personnel were in the cab of the tow vehicle. The tow vehicle was informed by the North Apron controller to pushback at their discretion. The Sunwing aircraft (under tow) began to move back and the APU contacted the right wing of the stationary WestJet aircraft. A fire rapidly ensued. The WestJet flight crew immediately commenced the required steps for an evacuation, and an evacuation was ordered shortly after. The tow vehicle operator pulled the Sunwing aircraft back towards the gate to separate the two aircraft. The slides on the WestJet aircraft were utilized on doors L1, R1 and L2, along with the over-wing exits on the left side; all passengers evacuated safely. The maintenance technician aboard the Sunwing aircraft exited the left cockpit window using the emergency rope and received minor injuries. ARFF arrived at the scene, and extinguished the fire. The Sunwing aircraft sustained substantial damage. Summary: In this accident, the pushback was conducted without the use of wing walkers, which is not in accordance with Swissport, Sunwing, and GTAA requirements. The investigation also determined that wing walkers were normally used by Swissport only when pushing back aircraft with passengers on board. In addition, the GTAA apron radio officer used phraseology that was not consistent with GTAA AMU procedures. WestJetÂs pre-flight safety briefings do not inform passengers to leave behind carry-on baggage in the event of an evacuation. During this occurrence, several passengers retrieved their carry-on baggage, despite the fact that FAs repeatedly provided specific instructions to the contrary.

Kennedy International Airport, USA. The right-hand wingtip of a Boeing 777-31BER (B-7185) operated by China Southern Airlines struck the APU in the tail of a Boeing 777-369ER (9K-AOC), operated by Kuwait Airways.  There were no personal injuries. Kuwait Airways flight KU117, a Boeing 777-300ER (9K-AOC), landed at 18:41 local time and due to lack of gates available, was assigned Hardstand 63. Due to a light pole adjacent to Hardstand 63 blocking the offload of the forward hold, both ground handling agencies coordinated in parking the aircraft short of the 777-300 stop mark to allow for the offloading of the forward hold.    The aircraft was parked on the 737 stop mark at 1855 LT and due to the tail overhanging into taxiway BB, that was closed.   China Southern flight CZ300, a Boeing 777-300 (B-7185), was towed off gate 6 at Terminal 4 at 20:00 LT with no available hardstand to park, so the aircraft was towed around the terminal area as needed during the traffic congestion until a hardstand was available.   Just prior to 23:40 LT, Hardstand 73 became available, and China Southern CZ300 was under tow at Spot 2 behind Terminal 4.  china southern cz300 was instructed  to proceed to hardstand 73 from spot 2 via taxiway g, taxiway bb, and taxiway h.   The pushback driver proceeded to turn right on taxiway G, then right onto taxiway BB (which had been closed earlier due to the KU overhang) and the right wing tip of CZ300 impacted the tail of KU117 at 23:45 LT. The pushback driver continued forward as he did not feel the impact and made a left turn onto taxiway H, then right turn into Hardstand 73.   Substantial damage to the tail of KU117, including the right and left horizontal stabilizer, elevator, tail cone and APU. Substantial damage to the CZ300  right wing and leading edge.Sources: http://gulfnews.com/news/americas/usa/plane-bumps-into-kuwait-airways-flight-ready-for-take-off-at-jfk-international-1.2152448  https://www.spa.gov.sa/viewfullstory.php?lang=en&newsid=1705945  FAA Media:The #PAPD Aircraft Rescue Fire Fighter Unit (ARFF) responded to Terminal 4, JFK, last night; a China Southern 777's wing tip struck the tail end of a Kuwait Airways 777 causing damage to both aircraft. #PAPDPROTECTSNYNJ pic.twitter.com/1g2isyyHD4â Port Authority PBA (@PAPD911) January 6, 2018 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates06-Jan-2018 12:19 gerard57 Added 06-Jan-2018 12:23 harro Updated [Aircraft type, Registration, Cn, Location, Departure airport, Source, Narrative, ]06-Jan-2018 12:58 harro Updated [Phase, Destination airport, Embed code, Narrative, ]06-Jan-2018 13:07 harro Updated [Embed code, Narrative, ]18-Oct-2024 17:33 ASN Updated [Other fatalities, Source, Damage, Narrative, ]18-Oct-2024 18:12 ASN Updated [Total occupants, Other fatalities, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The aircraft departed Nassau Airport at 19:00 hours local time on an instrument flight plan. Initially a Beech 1900 had been scheduled for this flight, but the airline decided to use C6-MIC, an EMB-110 Bandeirante, instead.  A revised flight plan was not submitted to ATC. Weather at the destination, Governor's Harbour Airport, was poor due to heavy rainfall. The pilot in command of the aircraft initially attempted a landing on runway 15 at Governor's Harbour Airport but executed a go-around when visual contact was lost due to heavy rain. On the second attempt for landing, a decision was made to switch to runway 33 and while on final approach to runway 33, visual contact was lost again and a second go-around was executed. On the third attempt the pilot landed on runway 33, but seconds after touchdown there was a collapse of the left main landing gear which subsequently led to a runway excursion taking place. Investigators noticed that the landing gear selector switch was located in the ""UP"" position. Consultation with the operator's maintenance personnel and the aircraft manufacturer has determined, based on the systems operation, that if the landing gear switch is placed in the ""UP"" position and the gear contact micro-switch on either landing gear is contaminated with dirt, water or other contaminants, or if the switch is shorted out for whatever reason, it is possible that the gear may not retract when commanded by the selection of the gear switch. In this instance, it is possible that the gear position lights may still indicate ""3-green lights"" (which normally indicates the gear as being ""down and locked"") despite the gear selector handle being selected to the ""UP"" position. However, once you land or the contaminant is removed or the ""system short"" is corrected, or no longer exists, there is a possibility that the gear could collapse (if the gear selector switch is in the ""UP"" position, as was the case). The AAID believes this to be the case, as no mechanical irregularities have been found or could be replicated that would otherwise explain why the gear collapsed.  The AAID also investigated the licensing and record keeping regarding the flight crew. It appeared that the captain of the flight initially had a US FAA license. During his stay in the US, he was convicted and incarcerated for controlled substance violations. As a consequence his FAA commercial pilot license was revoked for life on 11 August 2009. After returning to the Bahamas, he applied for an Airman License Validation based on a (revoked!) Foreign License in June 2011. It is unclear if he received this validation at that time. He was issued a commercial pilot license in May 2013, which was renewed in 2015 and valid until August 2020. The AAID found that no duty time, flight time or sectors were recorded for the captain between a proficiency check was completed on March 2013 and January 9, 2018 (date of the accident).  It also appeared that the Nassau-Lynden Pindling International Airport refused to issue an ID badge to the captain for unescorted access to the restricted airside, citing his US criminal record. Nevertheless he subsequently obtained an ID badge issued by the Grand Bahama Airport Company in Freeport, Grand Bahama. This was not valid for Nassau Airport, yet he managed to gain airside at Nassau without any problems. The AAID attributes this accident to ""pilot error."" The poor decision making exercised by the crew in attempting several landings in severe weather has been determined as the probable cause of the accident. Also contributing to this accident was the actions of the crew where, after 2 failed landing attempts and executing 2 go around maneuvers, they failed to realize the landing gear selector handle was selected in the ""UP"" position when the aircraft was configured for the 3rd landing. The situation was further exacerbated by additional human factor errors such as operating under periods of high stress, departing after such long delays, operating in severe weather, and flying at night- all factors experienced by the crew, which are contributory in this accident. Crew training, qualification, and authorization has been investigated and found questionable and also may have contributed to the accident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAID Bahamas Report number: AO-18-000002 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Local Airline Crash Lands - All Passengers Safe (eleutheranews.com, 10 Jan 2018) History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  24 June 2020 C6-MIC Pineapple Air 0 North Eleuthera International Airport (MYEH) min Tire failure 23 February 2024 C6-MIC Pineapple Air 0 Nassau-Lynden Pindling International Airport (NAS/MYNN) non Engine failure Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

During climb after takeoff from KrakÃ³w Airport, the nose landing gear (NLG) did not retract after moving the landing gear control lever to the UP position. Amber light N DOOR (nose door open), red light NOSE (nose gear not uplocked or downlocked) and red light on the landing gear control lever (gear in transit) illuminated. The CPT decided to continue the flight to the destination (EPWA). During the landing approach to EPWA, the crew extended the landing gear with the alternate system. The main landing gear (MLG) was extended and locked, but the NLG did not change its position. The crew made an emergency landing on EPWA RWY11 with NLG in the transit position, which was folded during the landing roll. When the plane came to rest on runway 11, the passengers were evacuated. All passengers and crew left the plane uninjured. The plane was damaged to an extent that required repair. Cause of the accident The immediate cause of the accident was excessive free play in the retraction/extension system of the nose landing gear. Contributing factors 1. Lack of procedures to measure and monitor the free play in the nose landing gear retraction/extension system during the Time Between Overhaul (30 000 Cycles or 14 years). 2. Lack of analysis of three-point landings which resulted in overload of NLG. 3.

The flight departed Cox's Bazar Airport at 10:53 hours local time and landed on runway 34 at Jessore Airport at 12:03. After clearing the runway via Romeo while taxying into and following the eastern taxy yellow guide line for parking into the BAY-1 at Jessore apron, the captain noticed four amber caution lights illuminate on the hydraulic panel. Subsequently, the captain noticed he lost the response of nose wheel steering. Upon application of brakes, there was no response. Soon after the captain and co-pilot checked and found hydraulic quantity reduced with zero pressure. The aircraft veered to the left and went out of the concrete apron into the soft ground. This resulted the left main wheel  striking a concrete slab causing the affected wheel to bend rearward and collapse. The left engine propeller struck the ground.  As per the captain and first officer, at that time, both tried to build-up hydraulic pressure with the hand pump but to no avail.4. According to the captain, he carried out a visual inspection and observed that the hydraulic reservoir installed in right hand engine was completely depleted. CAUSES: Metal fatigue leading to the breakage and dislocation of the hydraulic fitting that gave rise to loss of hydraulic fluid resulting the loss of steering wheel control and braking during taxing of the aircraft. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS Human factor: Delay in detecting the four hydraulic failure lights, especially by the pilot monitoring, during the landing roll and early part of taxing into the apron owing to the conspicuous location of the lights when the pilotsÂ eyes usually remain outside the cockpit.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIG-BD Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Aircraft Accident Investigation Group of Bangladesh   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft operated on a flight from Lagos, where it departed at 14:28 hours local time. The captain was the Pilot Flying  and the co-pilot was the Pilot Monitoring. The departure, cruise and approach to Abuja Airport were uneventful. Although runway 04 was the active runway, the aircraft was cleared for radar vectors for a visual final approach to runway 22. The aircraft was cleared to land at 15:17 hours. The reported wind by the tower was 070Â°at 7 knots. At 15:18, the aircraft landed slightly left of the runway centre line. According to the crew the aircraft started skidding left to right. The crew further reported that, as the brakes were applied, they noticed the aircraft oscillating left and right. The oscillation increased continuously until eventually the aircraft finally swivelled on the right shoulder of the runway where it came to a complete stop on a Magnetic Heading of 160Â°. Skid marks indicated that the aircraft steered in an S-pattern with increasing amplitude down the runway. On the last right turn, the right main wheel went into the grass and on the final left pattern, the right main landing gear strut detached from its main attachment point. Causal Factor: The use of improper directional control techniques to maintain the aircraft on the runway. Contributory Factor: Improper coordination in taking over control of the aircraft by the PM which was inconsistent with Nestoil SOP.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIB Nigeria Report number: NESTOIL/2018/01/25/F Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Abuja airport reopened after jet mishap (thecable.ng, 25 Jan. 2018) History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  1 October 2013 LZ-EVL Alpha Air 0 Odessa International Airport non Runway excursion Location  Images: photo (c) AAIB Nigeria; Abuja International Airport (ABV); 25 January 2018 photo (c) AAIB Nigeria; Abuja International Airport (ABV); 25 January 2018 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Preflight planning had noted the destination airport's runway conditions as ""good."" As the flight neared the destination airport and the crew conducted the approach checklist, the captain stated, ""light snow ... maybe slippery.""  When the crew checked the airportÂs automated terminal information service, the broadcast included ""light freezing rain."" The flight was transferred to the tower controller, who told the crew that the airport operations crew was on the runway about 20 minutes earlier and advised that it was starting to pick up traces of ice. The captain acknowledged the transmission and, after conducting a missed approach to runway 6L, requested to land on runway 24R. During the approach to runway 24R, the tower controller reported wind at 020Â° at 25 knots and also at 010Â° at 25 knots.  The crewmembers reported that, after touchdown, they applied maximum braking; however, the airplane did not slow and skidded off the end of the runway into the engineered material arresting system (EMAS), which resulted in substantial damage to the fuselage and a collapsed nose gear.Â  The crew stated that the runway grooves had been ""smoothed out"" by ice accumulations. A first responder reported that the ramp and taxiways were very icy, adding that the end of the runway and EMAS had a sheet of ice. A review of the airport's snow and ice control plan noted that the airport did not have pavement surface sensors and that operations personnel would monitor the airfield as conditions dictated. An airport operations log entry for a runway and field inspection, recorded about 24 minutes before the accident, noted a temperature of 31Â°F and a braking coefficient of 40 , with runways and taxiways wet. A log entry for a runway and field inspection recorded about 6 minutes after the accident noted a braking coefficient of 30-35, with runways and taxiways wet. The Runway Condition Assessment Matrix contained in Advisory Circular 150/5200-30D states that a braking coefficient of 40 or higher is the equivalent of a pilot-reported braking action of ""good,"" while a braking coefficient of 30-35 would be medium to poor. The field conditions noted during the pilotsÂ preflight planning indicated ""good"" braking conditions; however, the captain's statement of ""light snow ... maybe slippery,"" along with the tower controller's report that the runway was starting to pick up traces of ice, indicated that the crew was aware of the potential for braking conditions that were less than good, which would decrease braking action and increase the stopping distance. Further, the crewÂs selection of runway 24R, which led to the presence of a tailwind, also would decrease braking action. Probable Cause: The airplane's reduced braking performance due to an ice-covered runway, which resulted in a runway excursion. Contributing to the accident was the crew's selection of a runway with a tailwind.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All 65 passengers and 6 crew members were killed. The aircraft took off from runway 14R at Moscow's Domodedovo Airport at 14:21 hours local time (11:21 UTC). Weather about the time of departure at Domodedovo Airport included limited visibility (2100m) during light snowfall. Temperature was -5Â°C, overcast cloud deck at 2600 feet AGL. The Interstate Aviation Committee stated that, prior to departure, the heating of the three pitot tubes had not been turned on.  After takeoff, at an altitude of 130-150 m (425-490 ft) above ground level, the autopilot was switched on. Flaps were raised as the aircraft climbed through an altitude of 550 m (1800 feet). About 2 minutes 30 seconds after the takeoff, at an altitude of about 1300 meters (4265 feet) and an instrument speed of 465-470 km/h, there were discrepancies between the air speed readings on the captain's side compared to the standby airspeed indicator. The airspeed on the copilot's side is unknown as this parameter was not registered by the flight data recorder. There were no significant difference in the altitude indications. After another 25 seconds, the discrepancies reached about 30 km/h with the speed on the captain's side being greater. After about 50 seconds, at an altitude of about 2000 meters (6560 ft), the airspeed on the standby airspeed indicator was higher and continued to increase while the airspeed on the captains ASI continued to decrease. The flight crew then disconnected the autopilot. The airspeed on the captain's side continued to decrease, while the standby ASI showed 540-560 km/h. About 50 seconds after the autopilot was turned off, the flight passed an altitude of 1700-1900 m (5580-6230 ft) with vertical loads ranging from 1.5 to 0.5 g. Subsequently the aircraft entered a steep descent with the ASI on the captain's side showing 0 km/h, and the standby ASI showing 200 km/h. The pitch angle decreased to -30/-35 degrees with a vertical load factor of  0 g. The aircraft impacted a snowy field around 14:27:05 and disintegrated. Before the collision with the ground, the standby ASI had increased to 800 km/h with the captain's ASI still displaying 0 km/h. The captain of the An-148 had 2168 hours on type, of which 58 as captain. The first officer had 672 hours on type. The AN-148-100V RA-61704 crash occurred due to erroneous actions of the crew at the stage of climbing in instrument weather conditions at unreliable readings of instrument speed caused by icing (blockage of ice) of all three pitot tubes, which led to the loss of control over the parameters of the aircraft, its transfer to dive and collision with the ground. The accident was classified as a loss of control in flight (LOC-I). The investigation revealed systemic weaknesses in the identification of hazards and risk control, the inoperability of the airline's flight safety management system and the lack of control over the level of training of crew members by aviation authorities at all levels, which led to the issuance of certificates of aviation personnel and the admission to the flights of the crew, which did not fully meet the qualification requirements. The most likely contributing factors were: - Hurry of the crew in preparation for the flight due to the late arrival of the aircraft from the previous flight and attempts to ""catch up"" with the time; - Skipping by the crew of the operation to switch on the pitot tube heating before takeoff and failing to comply with the section of the check list ""BEFORE TAKE-OFF"", which provides for the control of this action; - design features of the An-148 aircraft in terms of the restrictions on the duration of pitot tube heating operation on the ground, which led to the need to carry out operations to control the inclusion of pitot tube heating and compliance with the principle of ""dark cockpit"" in a separate section of the ""BEFORE THE FLIGHT"" check list, which is performed immediately before the start of the takeoff run, which creates additional risks of missing these operations. These actions are provided in the section ""ON THE RUNWAY START""; - systematic failure of the airline's crews to comply with the ""dark cockpit"" principle and the requirements of the radar, which contributed to ""getting used"" to the takeoff with the presence of emergency and warning messages on the Integrated system and alarm indicator (KISS) and did not allow to identify the fact that the pitot tube heating was not included. In the accident flight before takeoff, six warning messages were displayed on the KISS, including three messages about the absence of pitot tube heating; - design features of the An-148 aircraft, connected with the impossibility to disable the display of a number of warning messages on the KISS even when performing the whole range of works provided for by the MMEL while ensuring the flight with delayed defects; - low safety culture in the airline, which was manifested in: systematic failure to record in the flight log the failures detected during the flight, as well as in the performance of flights with the failures not eliminated and/or not included in the list of delayed failures, accompanied by the corresponding messages on the KISS; - Failure to take necessary measures in case of detection of previous facts of untimely activation of pitot tube heating by crews based on the results of express analysis of flight information; - Unreadiness of the crew to take actions in case of triggering the alarm ""Speed of Emergency"" due to the lack of appropriate theoretical training in the airline and the impossibility to work out this special situation on the flight simulation device and / or during airfield training and, as a consequence, failure to comply with the procedures provided for after triggering of this alarm; - Absence of federal aviation regulations for certification of flight simulators, the development of which is provided for by the Air Code of the Russian Federation; - Approval for the existing AN-148 flight simulators of the IFC Training LLC and the CTC of the Saint-Petersburg State University of Civil Aviation without taking into account their actual capabilities to reproduce special flight cases, as well as the provisions of FAR-128; - Absence of specific values of flight parameters (engine operation mode, pitch and roll angles, etc.) in the aircraft's flight maMETAR: 10:30 UTC / 13:30 local time: UUDD 111030Z 14005MPS 2500 R14R/1800U R14L/P2000D -SHSN BKN007 BKN026CB M05/M06 Q1019 R14R/590293 R14L/590392 TEMPO 1000 SHSN11:00 UTC / 14:00 local time: UUDD 111100Z 14006MPS 1800 R14R/1900U R14L/1800U SHSN BKN007 BKN026CB M05/M06 Q1019 R14R/590293 R14L/590392 NOSIG11:30 UTC / 14:30 local time: UUDD 111130Z 13006MPS 2100 -SN SCT008 OVC026 M05/M06 Q1019 R14R/590293 R14L/590392 TEMPO 1200 SHSN BKN012CB12:00 UTC / 15:00 local time: UUDD 111200Z 13005MPS 1900 R14R/2000D R14L/1900D SN SCT007 OVC026 M05/M06 Q1019 R14R/590293 R14L/590491 TEMPO 1200 SHSN BKN012CBAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: RT.com  Flightradar24 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  28 July 2013 RA-61704 Rossiya 0 Saint Petersburg-Pulkovo Airport (LED/ULLI) min Engine failure 23 August 2013 RA-61704 Rossiya 0 Saint Petersburg-Pulkovo Airport (LED/ULLI) min Location  Images: photo (c) MAK; Moskva-Domodedovo Airport (DME/UUDD); 11 February 2018 photo (c) Flightradar24; Moskva-Domodedovo Airport (DME/UUDD); 11 February 2018 photo (c) ASN; Moskva-Domodedovo Airport (DME/UUDD); 11 February 2018 photo (c) MAK; Moskva-Domodedovo Airport (DME/UUDD); February 2018 photo (c) MAK; Moskva-Domodedovo Airport (DME/UUDD); February 2018 photo (c) MAK; Moskva-Domodedovo Airport (DME/UUDD); February 2018 photo (c) Papas Dos; Moskva-Domodedovo Airport (DME/UUDD); 06 May 2017; (CC:by) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft, an Airbus A330-223, took off from runway 18R at 22:52 hours. When the aircraft was climbing out of 1700ft AMSL, the no. 1 engine fire warning came ON. A few seconds later, the crew declared an emergency and requested an immediate return which was approved by ATC. The aircraft landed at about 22:59 and stopped on runway 18R. The Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting Services (ARFFS) reported observing fire on engine no.1 and extinguished it. Passengers were evacuated using the emergency slides on the right side of the aircraft. One passenger sustained serious injuries while 11 suffered minor injuries. Causal Factor An overtemperature condition and localized fire within the No. 1 engine cowling triggered a fire warning. The overtemperature and fire were caused by the ignition of fuel from a hairline crack on the fuel manifold supplying fuel nozzle 1. Contributory factor The fuel manifold cracking can be attributed to high vibratory stresses due to coupling of an acoustic combustor mode and a fuel manifold structural mode. Note: AIB Nigeria rated the occurence a 'Serious Incident'. However, as per ICAO Annex 13, this event was an Accident as one occupant had suffered serious injuries.

All on board were killed. The flight departed Mehrabad Airport at 08:05 hours local time and climbed to the cruising altitude of FL210. At 09:22 the aircraft was over the Isfahan (IFN) VOR. The flight requested permission to descend from FL210 to FL170. This was approved by Tehran ACC. The flight followed Airway W114 from the OBTUX navaid to the Yasuj DVOR/DME. Minimum altitude on that airway is FL170. Minimum safe altitude (MSA) over the sector close to Yasuj Airport is 15500 feet. Weather reported to the crew indicated a cloud ceiling of 15000 feet. Despite their clearance for FL170 and the MSA in the area, the crew subsequently selected FL150 as their target altitude.  The flight levelled off at FL150 at 09:28 hours and the de-ice & anti-ice systems were switched on. Subsequently the flight crew selected the autopilot's altitude mode to FL150. The aircraft then entered a mountain wave with vertical (updraft) winds reaching up to 3000 ft/min with associated icing conditions. Since the autopilot attempted to maintain FL150, engine power reduced to flight idle and the aircraft pitched down -4Â°. In these conditions the speed gradually reduced from a Calibrated Airspeed (CAS) of 205 knots. At 09:29:44 the flight crew switched off the de-ice & anti-ice systems. The aircraft then entered a mountain wave downdraft. Engine powered increased and the nose pitched up because the autopilot was attempting to get back to FL150. The CAS meanwhile dropped to 130 knots. The pilot then selected FL140 on the autopilot as the airspeed dropped to 118 knots. The stall warning sounded and the autopilot disconnected automatically. Airspeed increased to 134 knots as the aircraft descended at a rate of -3200 ft/m. At 09:31:22 the flight crew re-engaged the autopilot and set FL150 as their target altitude. Four seconds later the aircraft became close to the surrounding mountainous terrain and the EGPWS alarm sounded. Radio altitude at that point was 3643 feet (pressure altitude 13869 ft). The autopilot was disengaged again as the aircraft continued to lose altitude. Unable to regain altitude the flight crew noticed the mountain side ahead rolled the plane -86Â° to the left. The nose pitched up and the aircraft impacted the side of a mountain at 09:31:41. The wreckage was located the following day in the snow, 350 feet below the top of a 13,412 ft high mountain. Probable causes (from final report): The main cause of accident: The accident was happened due to many chains of considered causes but the 'Human Factor' had main role for the conclusion of the scenario. The Cockpit Crew action which has caused dangerous conditions for the flight is considered as main cause. Based on provided evidences, the errors of cockpit crew were as follows: - Continuing to the Yasouj airport for landing against Operation manual of the Company, due to low altitude ceiling of the cloud and related cloud mass. They should divert to alternate airport. - Descending to unauthorized altitude below minimum of the route and MSA - Lack of enough CRM during flight - Failure to complete the stall recovery (flap setting, max RPM). - Inappropriate use of Autopilot after Stall condition - Inadequate anticipation for bad weather based on OM (Clouds, Turbulence, and Icing ...) - Quick action to switch off anti-ice system and AOA - Failure to follow the Check lists and standard call out by both pilots Contributing Factors: The contributive factors to this accident include but are not limited to the following: - the airline was not capable to detect systematic defectives about : - effectiveness of crew training about Meteorology, OM, SOP, ... - enough operational supervision on pilot behaviors - The lack of SIGMET about Mountain Wave or Severe Mountain wave - Unclear procedure for stall recovery in FCOM - Lack of warning in aircraft manuals by manufacturer for flight crew awareness about mountain wave. - Lack of APM System to alert crew about performance degradationMETAR: 05:30 UTC / 09:00 local time: OISY 180530Z 09004KT 9999 FEW035CB SCT040 OVC090 14/M01 Q102206:00 UTC / 09:30 local time: OISY 180600Z 13004KT 9999 FEW035CB SCT040 OVC090 13/M00 Q102106:30 UTC / 10:00 local time: OISY 180630Z 14006KT 9999 FEW035CB SCT040 OVC090 15/M02 Q1021Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Iran Report number: A13961129EPATS Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: PressTV  Mehr News   Location  Images: photo (c) aerospacetalk.ir; near Yasuj Airport (YES/OISY); 20 February 2018 photo (c) aerospacetalk.ir; near Yasuj Airport (YES/OISY); 20 February 2018 photo (c) Google Earth / ASN annotations; near Yasuj Airport (YES/OISY); 18 February 2018 photo (c) CAO Iran / ASN annotations; near Yasuj Airport (YES/OISY); 18 February 2018 photo (c) CAO Iran; near Yasuj Airport (YES/OISY); 18 February 2018 photo (c) CAO Iran; near Yasuj Airport (YES/OISY); 18 February 2018 photo (c) Aeroprints.com; Dubai Airport (DXB/OMDB); 01 October 2006; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates03-Jan-2025 14:42 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The first officer was the Pilot Flying (PF) while the captain was the Pilot Monitoring (PM). Following an uneventful en route part of the flight, the aircraft was issued descent clearances to FL220 and then further down to FL80. During descent, the PF briefed for the localizer approach to runway 21. Port Harcourt Approach then reported the presence of cumulonimbus (Cb) clouds along the approach path of runway 21, and requested flight 363 to report intentions. Dana 363 responded ""I will like to come closer then we take our decision I will advise"". Meanwhile, the Tower controller informed the Approach controller that the intensity of rain had increased to heavy rain. At 18:43 Arik Air 766 peformed a go around on the approach to runway 03 due to windshear.  At 18:45, Dana 363 was cleared for the LOC approach to runway 21. Shortly afterwards the captain took over control after realizing the Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) 2 was unserviceable. When the aircraft was 12 miles to touch down, the Approach controller instructed the flight to contact Tower. The crew was engaged in changing the frequencies on the navigation radio receivers since the VOR DME was not showing. An initial attempt by the PM to contact the Tower was not on the correct frequency, during which both Tower and Approach were trying to contact the aircraft. Approximately 1.5 minutes after the first attempt, contact with the Tower was established on the correct frequency. The captain then instructed the first officer to watch out for the runway. A few seconds after, the captain was heard yelling for wipers. After a while, the captain sighted the runway and instructed the first officer to report this to the Tower controller. Thirty-two seconds later, an aural warning ""Sink rate""! ""Sink rate""!! ""Sink rate""!!! ""Sink rate""!!!! came on. The aircraft descended through approach minimums (460 feet AGL), crossed the threshold and did a smooth touchdown on the runway at 7972 feet from the threshold in high winds of 360Â°/22 kt. The aircraft landed without obtaining landing clearance from the Tower controller. Landing Distance Available (LDA) for runway 21 was 9843 feet which left a remaining length of 1871 feet for the aircraft to stop. According to the captain, during landing roll, the brakes were applied while simultaneously deploying thrust reversers to maximum; all spoilers automatically deployed after the nose wheel touched the ground. The crew continued to apply brakes until maximum braking was commanded. The aircraft could not be stopped during brake application and the captain continued applying the brake pedals to maximum. The aircraft was on the centreline until it veered off left approximately 200 feet from the end of the runway, exited the paved surface and came to a stop 978 feet from the end of the runway After the aircraft came to a complete stop, engines were shut down and emergency power switch was turned ON. The emergency light came ON, all other lights were OFF and the Public Address System was not working, the lead crew had to open the cockpit door to obtain emergency evacuation instructions from the captain. Emergency evacuation was carried out using only the left forward main door and the escape slide on this door did not deploy. All persons on board were evacuated unhurt. Causal factor: The accident was caused by an underestimation of the degradation of weather conditions (heavy rain, visibility and strong wind on short final and landing) and the failure by the crew to initiate a missed approach which was not consistent with the companyÂs SOP. Contributory Factors: Other contributing factors to this accident were: - Non-compliance to companyÂs SOP in meeting crew competency and complement requirements. - Ineffective two-way communication between the ATC and DAN0363 during final approach prevented the flow of technical information on runway surface condition and other relevant meteorological information essential to safety. - Failure of the crew to crosscheck the prevailing wind and also to obtain landing clearance from the ATC during final approach after contact with ATC was restored.METAR: 19:00 UTC / 20:00 local time: METAR DNPO 201900Z 24013KT 1500 TSRA BKN006 FEW018CB 22/21 Q1006 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIB Nigeria Report number: DANA/2018/02/20/F Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: AIB Nigeria   Location  Images: photo (c) AIB Nigeria; Port Harcourt Airport (PHC); 21 February 2018 photo (c) AIB Nigeria; Port Harcourt Airport (PHC); 21 February 2018 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Weather conditions at Abbotsford at the time of departure consisted of a temperature of -2Â°C in moderate to heavy snowfall with winds of approximately 10 knots. Prior to the departure, the fuel tanks were filled to capacity and the pilot and passengers boarded the aircraft inside the operator's heated hangar. The aircraft was towed outside of the hangar without being treated with anti-ice fluid, and taxied for the departure on runway 07. Due to an inbound arrival at Abbotsford, C-GIAE was delayed for departure. Once cleared for takeoff, the aircraft had been exposed to snow and freezing conditions for approximately 13 minutes.  Approximately 4 to 5 seconds after takeoff, the pilot selected the landing gear control to the up position. As the gear retracted, the aircraft rolled approximately 30Â° to the left. To correct the uncommanded left bank, the pilot applied right aileron, and the aircraft returned to a near wings-level attitude. In order to make an immediate off-field emergency landing, the pilot retarded the power levers and then applied forward pressure on the control column to land the aircraft. The aircraft struck terrain between runway 07 and taxiway C. The aircraft slid across the snow-covered ground for approximately 760 feet before coming to rest in a raspberry patch located on the airport property. Four passengers and the pilot sustained serious injuries as a result of the accident which destroyed the aircraft. Findings as to causes and contributing factors: 1. The occurrence aircraft exited a warm hangar and was exposed to 14 minutes of heavy snow in below-freezing conditions. This resulted in a condition highly conducive to severe ground icing. 2. As the aircraft climbed out of ground effect on takeoff, it experienced an aerodynamic stall as a result of wing contamination. 3. The pilot's decision making was affected by continuation bias, which resulted in the pilot attempting a takeoff with an aircraft contaminated with ice and snow adhering to its critical surfaces. 4. The pilot and the passenger seated in the right-hand crew seat were not wearing the available shoulder harnesses. As a result, they sustained serious head injuries during the impact sequence. 5. During the impact sequence, the cargo restraint system used to secure the baggage in the rear baggage compartment failed, causing some of the baggage to injure passengers seated in the rear of the aircraft cabin.METAR: 19:27 UTC / 11:27 local time: CYXX 231927Z 08003KT 5/8SM R07/4000FT/D SN OVC007 M02/M03 A3036 RMK SN5SC3 /S02/ SLP28520:00 UTC / 12:00 local time: CYXX 232000Z VRB02KT 3/8SM R07/3000V4500FT/D SN BKN006 OVC013 M02/M03 A3034 RMK SN5SF2NS1 /S03/ SLP28020:12 UTC / 12:12 local time: CYXX 232012Z 00000KT 3/8SM R07/3000FT/N SN BKN006 OVC013 M02/M03 A3034 RMK SN5SF2NS1 SLP27820:47 UTC / 12:47 local time: CYXX 232047Z 19008KT 1/2SM R07/3000V4500FT/N SN BKN006 OVC017 M02/M03 A3031 RMK SN4SF2NS2 SLP267Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A18P0031 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: TSB A18P0031   Location  Images: photo (c) TSB Canada; Abbotsford Airport, BC (YXX); 24 February 2018 photo (c) TSB Canada; Abbotsford Airport, BC (YXX); 24 February 2018 photo (c) Transport Canada; Abbotsford Airport, BC (YXX); 23 February 2018 photo (c) TSB Canada; Abbotsford Airport, BC (YXX); 23 February 2018 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The charter flight touched down at Sept-Ãles (CYZV) at 08:36 and took off again for the third flight leg at 1049, bound for Havre-Saint-Pierre (CYGV). The aircraft conducted an approach to runway 08, which was snow-covered, while visibility was reduced due to heavy snow showers, and landed approximately 3800 feet beyond the threshold, at approximately 700 feet from the end of the runway. It continued its landing roll beyond the runway until it came to rest in a snowbank, approximately 220 feet beyond the end of the runway. The aircraft sustained substantial damage. Four of the occupants received minor injuries. Findings as to causes and contributing factors - The captain continued the approach beyond the final approach fix when the reported visibility was below the approach ban minima. - During the approach, runway lighting was reduced to medium intensity, which was 30% of maximum strength, thereby reducing the probability of seeing the visual references required to conduct the landing on the runway. - The captain proceeded with the landing sequence, without seeing or knowing the length of the remaining runway ahead and unable to accurately assess the aircraftÂs position. - The aircraft landed approximately 3800 feet past the threshold, 700 feet from the end of the runway, and stopped its landing roll in a snowbank, 220 feet beyond the runway. - The deviation from standard operating procedures at a critical moment of flight was a source of confusion between the flight crew members, to the point where the aircraft was not configured for a landing, which increased the landing distance required. - The captain, focused on the landing manoeuvre and experiencing narrowed attention, was unable to make the decision to conduct a go-around. He lost the notion of time and flew over the runway for 20 seconds, not realizing that it was now impossible to touch down and come to a stop before the end of the runway. - Without policies, clear procedures and training, the first officer did not have the tools necessary to shift from a passive advisory role to proactive assertiveness strong enough to convince the captain to conduct a go-around. - The approach ban was ineffective in preventing this approach while visibility on the ground was below the minimum required for an approach ban.METAR: 15:19 UTC / 10:19 local time: CYGV 261519Z AUTO 18010G15KT 1 3/4SM -SN OVC009 M03/M04 A2985 RMK SLP11216:09 UTC / 11:09 local time: CYGV 261609Z AUTO 16004KT 1/4SM +SN VV004 M03/M03 A2984 RMK SLP10817:20 UTC / 12:20 local time: CYGV 261720Z AUTO 15004KT 1SM -SN OVC009 M02/M03 A2980 RMK SLP096Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A18Q0030 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: TSB A18Q0030   Location  Images: photo (c) TSB Canada; Havre-Saint-Pierre Airport, QC (YGV); 26 February 2018; (CC:by-nc-nd) photo (c) TSB Canada; Havre-Saint-Pierre Airport, QC (YGV); 26 February 2018; (CC:by-nc-nd) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

At 12:03 hours local time the aircraft departed Tallinn as crew training flight MYX9001. Onboard were a captain-instructor as well as a second pilot, four students and a Civil Aviation Administration inspector.  Numerous circuits and touch-and-goes were performed, including two full stop landings.  During final approach to runway 08 at 17:04, the aircraft stopped responding to flight control inputs. Altitude was lost and the aircraft hit the runway. The engines touched the runway and the main landing gear doors broke.  The aircraft then managed to gain altitude and the pilots were able to stabilize the aircraft and turn back. Both engines, however, lost power after the turn back to the airport. An emergency landing was carried out at 17:11, about 150 meters from the runway. The aircraft came to a halt in the snow 15 meters south of the runway. The flight crew members evacuated the aircraft via the L1 door emergency escape slides.  A video of the incident shows what appears to be a tire rolling away from the aircraft as it came to a stop. Photos from the scene seem to show that one of the nose landing gear tires is missing. Photos also indicate that the ram air turbine (RAT) had been deployed. Causal factors: This accident results from the combination of the following factors: - The intermittent THSA override mechanism malfunction allowing to cause the loss of pitch control by both ELACs. The repetitive triggering of the ELAC PITCH faults was caused by the non or late activations of the PTA micro-switches, which were due to the OVM piston insufficient stroke. The insufficient OVM stroke was caused by the THSA OVM clutch unit non-standard friction. The oil in the THSA OVM casing appeared to be with a higher viscosity than defined in the CMM. The higher viscosity might have reduced the friction of the OVM clutch unit, causing the THSA OVM nonstandard friction. - SEC design flaw allowing for a single event, the left landing gear temporary dedecompression, to cause the loss of pitch control by both SECs. The absence of ground spoilers arming for landing in the context of touch and go's training may have contributed to the temporary decompression of the left main landing gear. - The training instructor`s decision for continuation of the flight despite repetitive ELAC PITCH FAULT ECAM caution messages.  The lack of clear framework of operational rules for training flights, especially concerning the application of the MEL, and the specific nature of operations that caused pressure to complete the training program may have impacted the crew decision-making process. Contributory factors - Smartlynx Estonia ATO TM does not clearly define the need for arming spoilers when performing touch-and-go training (ATO procedures not in accordance with Airbus SOP). The fact that there is no clear reference in the Smartlynx Estonia ATO TM Touch-And-Go air exercise section to additional procedures that should be used, in combination with lack of understanding of the importance for arming the spoilers during this type of flights contributed to TRI making a decision to disarm the spoilers during touch and go training enabling landing gear bounce on touch down. - At the time of the event Airbus QRH did not define the maximum allowed number of resets for the flight control computers. - At the time of the event Airbus FCTM did not require to consider MEL on touch-and-go and stop-and-go training. - The oil in the THS OVM casing was with higher viscosity than defined in the CMM. The higher viscosity might have reduced the friction of the OVM clutch unit. - The aircraft maintenance documentation does not require any test of the OVM during aircraft regular maintenance checks. - Smartlynx Estonia ATO OM does not clearly specify the role in the cockpit for the Safety Pilot. The lack of task sharing during the event caused the ECAM warnings to be left unnoticed and unannounced for a long period. - The crew not resetting the ELAC 1. The fact that ELAC 1 PITCH FAULT was left unreset lead to the degradation of the redundancy of the system. Considering the remoteness of the loss control of both elevators, there is no specific crew training for MECHANICAL BACKUP in pitch during approach, landing and take-off. This condition of the aircraft occurred for the crew in a sudden manner on rotation and during training flight, where the experienced TRI is not in PF role and cannot get immediate feedback of the aircraft behaviour and condition. Despite these difficult conditions the crew managed to stabilize and land the aircraft with no major damage to the persons on board. The crew performance factors that contributed to the safe landing of the aircraft are the following: - The TRI followed the golden rule of airmanship (fly, navigate, communicate), by stabilizing the aircraft pitch by using the trim wheel and by keeping the aircraft engine power as long as possible; - The Safety Pilot started to play a role in the cockpit by assisting the TRI and student by informing them about the status of the aircraft and later on taking the role of the PM.METAR: 14:20 UTC / 16:20 local time: EETN 281420Z 07011KT 3700 SHSN DRSN SCT009 SCT013CB M12/M15 Q1043 R08/810295 NOSIG14:50 UTC / 16:50 local time: EETN 281450Z 07013KT 9000 -SHSN DRSN FEW008 BKN013 FEW015CB M13/M15 Q1043 R08/810295 NOSIG 15:20 UTC / 17:20 local time: EETN 281520Z 07012KT 9999 -SHSN DRSN FEW008 BKN013 FEW015CB M13/M15 Q1043 R08/490195 NOSIG 15:50 UTC / 17:50 local time: EETN 281550Z 09011KT 9999 -SN DRSN OVC013 M13/M15 Q1042 R08/490195 NOSIG 16:20 UTC / 18:20 local time: EETN 281620Z 09010KT 9999 -SN OVC014 M14/M16 Q1042 R08/490195 NOSIG Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ESIB Report number: A2802118 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: lentoposti.fi  delfi.lv  Plane to make emergency landing in Tallinn landed with stopped engines (news.err.ee, 14 March 2018)   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Congo. The aircraft departed Kinshasa-N'Djili Airport on a cargo flight to Lubumbashi. A training captain was seated on the right and the trainee captain on the left seat. The third pilot had the role of safety pilot. The trainee captain was on his fifth line training flight. At Lubumbashi, the crew was cleared for an instrument landing procedure for runway 07. In the pre-landing briefing, AUTO BRAKE 2 mode was selected for deceleration of the aircraft. No anomalies or technical malfunctions were reported to ATC. The weather conditions were good with calm winds. On landing, the aircraft landed in the touchdown zone according to the crew, the rollout on the runway appeared normal, and deceleration was progressive. At about 80 knots, the crew noted that the aircraft was diverging to the left of the runway centreline. The crew immediately switched to manual braking, but to no avail, the aircraft continued the skid until it went off the runway and came to a stop, leaving the right main gear on the runway. The nose landing gear, passing over the less compact shoulder, became bogged down and then broke off. The left main landing gear, with the weight of the aircraft, also dug in so that the left engine touched the ground. The aircraft sustained substantial damage in the area of the nose landing gear cage (wheel well). Contributing facts: (a) Reduction of simulator training hours for economic reasons for someone who has never performed the duties of controlling an aircraft on the ground. (b) The runway shoulders at Lubumbashi (Luano) do not have the same characteristics with regard to strength (see Annex 14 and Document 9157 Part 3). In conclusion, the actions taken on the rudder before it became ineffective must have been the cause of the aircraft's deviation from the runway centreline and the loss of control of the aircraft (LOC-G).Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BPEA Report number: BPEA/ACCID 01/2018 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Times.cd   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft departed Sharjah, UAE at 13:11 UTC on a flight to Istanbul, Turkey. The aircraft entered Tehran FIR fifteen minutes later and the Tehran ACC controller cleared the flight to climb to FL360 according to its flight plan. About 14:32, the pilot requested FL380, which was approved. Before reaching that altitude, the left and right airspeeds began to diverge by more than 10 knots. The left (captain's) airspeed indicator showed an increase while the right hand (copilot's) airspeed indicator showed a decrease. A caution aural alert notified the flight crew of the difference. Remarks by the flight crew suggested that an 'EFIS COMP MON' caution message appeared on the EICAS. As the aircraft was climbing, the crew reduced thrust to idle. Approximately 63 seconds later, while approaching FL380, the overspeed aural warning (clacker) began to sound, indicating that the indicated Mach had exceeded M 0.85. Based on the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) of the aircraft, the pilot flying should validate the IAS based on the aircraft flight manual and define the reliable Air Data Computer (ADC) and select the reliable Air Data source. The pilot did not follow this procedure and directly reduced engine power to decrease the IAS after hearing the clacker. The actual airspeed thus reached a stall condition. The copilot tried to begin reading of the 'EFIS COMP MON' abnormal procedure for three times but due to pilot interruption, she could not complete it. Due to decreasing speed, the stall aural warning began to sound, in addition to stick shaker and stick pusher activating repeatedly. The crew then should have referred to another emergency procedure to recover from the stall condition. While the stick pusher acted to pitch down the aircraft to prevent a stall condition, the captain was mistakenly assumed an overspeed situation due to the previous erroneous overspeed warning and pulled on the control column. The aircraft entered a series of pitch and roll oscillations. The autopilot was disengaged by the crew before stall warning, which ended the oscillations. Engine power began to decrease on both sides until both engines flamed out in a stall condition. From that point on FDR data was lost because the electric bus did not continue to receive power from the engine generators. The CVR recording continued for a further approximately 1 minute and 20 seconds on emergency battery power. Stall warnings, stick shaker and stick pusher activations continued until the end of the recording. The aircraft then impacted mountainous terrain. Unstable weather conditions were present along the flight route over Iran, which included moderate up to severe turbulence and icing conditions up to 45000ft. These conditions could have caused ice crystals to block the left-hand pitot tube. It was also reported that the aircraft was parked at Sharjah Airport for three days in dusty weather condition. Initially the pitot covers had not been applied. The formation of dust inside the pitot tube was considered another possibility. The Iranian investigators stated that both TSB Canada and Bombardier Inc. had some limitations to support the Iranian investigation team under U.S. and Canadian law against standard 4.6 of Annex 13 to ICAO convention. Main cause and contributing factors: The accident was caused by insufficient operational prerequisites for the management of erratic airspeed indication failure by the cockpit crew.  Contributing factors were: - The aircraft designer/manufacturer provided insufficient technical and operational guidance about airspeed malfunctions that previously occurred. - Lack of effective CRM.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Iran Report number: A961220TC-TRB Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources: Aerospacetalk.ir  Airporthaber   Location  Images: photo (c) flybyeigenheer; GenÃ¨ve-Cointrin Airport (GVA/LSGG); 08 February 2016; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) RenÃ© Verschuur; Istanbul-AtatÃ¼rk International Airport (IST/LTBA); 14 June 2013 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Prior to departure, while in radio contact with Dhaka Ground Control and the airline's Operations department, the captain shows signs that he was agitated and experiencing high levels of stress. As the aircraft was in a climb phase, the captain overheard a communication between Operations and another US-Bangla aircraft regarding the fuel onboard but the captain without verifying whether the message was meant for him or not, engaged in some unnecessary conversation with the Operations staff. The Captain's vocal pitch and language used again indicated that he was very much emotionally disturbed and experiencing high level of stress. The aircraft established its first contact with Kathmandu Control at 07:52 UTC. At 08:07 the First Officer contacted Kathmandu Control and requested descent clearance. Kathmandu Control cleared the flight to descend to FL160 with an estimated approach time of 08:26 which was acknowledged by the First Officer. At 08:10 the flight was handed over to Kathmandu Approach. At 08:11, Kathmandu Approach instructed the aircraft to descend to 13500 feet and hold over GURAS. The crew inserted the HOLD in the Flight Management System. At 08:13 Kathmandu Approach further instructed the aircraft to reduce its speed and descend to 12500 feet. Three minutes later a further descent clearance was given to 11500 feet, and the flight was cleared for a VOR approach to runway 02 maintaining minimum approach speed. Both crew members forgot to cancel the hold on the FMS as they were engaged in some unnecessary conversation. Upon reaching GURAS, the aircraft turned left to enter the holding pattern over GURAS, which was noticed by both crew members and immediately the captain made a correction. At the same time they were alerted by Approach Control. The captain immediately selected a heading of 027Â° which was just 5Â° of interception angle to intercept the desired radial of 202Â° inbound to KTM. The spot wind recorded was westerly at 28kt. The aircraft continued approach on heading mode and crossed radial 202Â° at 7 DME of KTM VOR. The aircraft then continued on the same heading of 027Â° and deviated to the right of the final approach course. Having deviated to the right of the final approach path, the aircraft reached about 2-3 NM North east of the KTM VOR and continued to fly further northeast. At 08:27, Kathmandu Tower (TWR) alerted the crew that the landing clearance was given for runway 02 but the aircraft was proceeding towards runway 20. At 08:29, Tower Controller asked the crew of their intention to which the captain replied that they would be landing on runway 02. The aircraft then made an orbit to the right. The Controller instructed the aircraft to join downwind for runway 02 and report when sighting another Buddha Air aircraft which was already on final for runway 02. The aircraft instead of joining downwind leg for runway 02, continued on the orbit to the right on a westerly heading towards Northwest of runway 20. The controller instructed the aircraft to remain clear of runway 20 and continue to hold at the present position as the Buddha Air aircraft was landing on runway 02 (from the opposite side) at that time. After the landing of the Buddha Air aircraft, the Tower Controller, at 08:32 UTC gave a choice to BS211 to land either on runway 20 or 02 but the aircraft again made an orbit to the right, this time northwest of runway 20. While continuing with the turn through a southeastern direction, the captain reported that he had the runway in sight and requested tower for clearance to land. The Tower Controller cleared the aircraft to land but when the aircraft was still turning for the runway it approached very close to the threshold of runway 20 on a westerly heading and not aligned with the runway. At 08:33:27 UTC, spotting the aircraft maneuvering at very close proximity to the ground and not aligned with the runway, the Tower Controller hurriedly cancelled the landing clearance of the aircraft by saying, ""Takeoff clearance cancelled"". Within the next 15-20 seconds, the aircraft pulled up in westerly direction and with very high bank angle turned left and flew over the western area of the domestic apron, continued on a southeasterly heading past the ATC Tower and further continued at a very low height, flew over the domestic southern apron area and finally attempted to align with the runway 20 to land. During this process, while the aircraft was turning inwards and momentarily headed towards the control tower, the tower controllers ducked down out of fear that the aircraft might hit the tower building. Missing the control tower, when the aircraft further turned towards the taxi track aiming for the runway through a right reversal turn, the tower controller made a transmission by saying, ""BS 211, I say again..."". At 08:34 UTC the aircraft touched down 1700 meters down the threshold with a bank angle of about 15 degrees and an angle of about 25 degrees with the runway axis (approximately heading Southeast) and to the left of the center line of runway 20, then veered southeast out of the runway through the inner perimeter fence along the rough down slope and finally stopped about 442 meters southeast from the first touchdown point on the runway. All four crew members (2 cockpit crew and 2 cabin crew) and 45 out of the 67 passengers onboard the aircraft were killed in the accident. Two more passengers succumbed to injury later in hospital during course of treatment. The aircraft caught fire after 6 seconds of touchdown which engulfed major portions of the aircraft. An investigation into the captain's behaviour showed that he had history of depression while serving in the Bangladesh Air Force in 1993 and was removed from active duty after evaluation by a psychiatrist. He was re-evaluated by a psychiatrist in January 2002 and was declared to be fit for flying. Examinations in successive annual medical checks were not focused on his previous medical condition of depression, possibly because this was not declared in the self-declaration form for annual medicals. During the flight the captain was irritable, tensed, moody, and aggressive at various times. He was smoking during the flight, contrary to company regulations. He also used foul language and abusive words in conversation with the junior female first officer. He was engaged in unnecessary conversation during the approach, at a time when sterile cockpit rules were in force. The captain seemed very unsecure about his future as he had submitted resignation from this company, though only verbally. He said he did not have any job and did not know what he was going to do for living. The Probable Causes: The Accident Investigation Commission determines that the probable cause of the accident is due to disorientation and a complete loss of situational awareness in the part of crewmember. Contributing to this the aircraft was offset to the proper approach path that led to maneuvers in a very dangerous and unsafe attitude to align with the runway. Landing was completed in a sheer desperation after sighting the runway, at very close proximity and very low altitude. There was no attempt made to carry out a go around, when a go around seemed possible until the last instant before touchdown on the runway. Contributing Factors: a. Improper timing of the pre-flight briefing and the commencement of the flight departure in which the operational pre-flight briefing was given in early morning but the flight departure time was around noon and there were four domestic short flights scheduled in between. b.

The pedestrian sustained serious injuries, and the airplane sustained substantial damage. The captain, first officer, and the three passengers on board the airplane were not injured. The purpose of the flight was to provide logistical support of ICEX 2018, which involves, in part, U.S. Navy and U.K Royal Navy submarines operating beneath the frozen Arctic Ocean during a 5-week exercise. The flight used an airstrip on the sea ice that was lined on both sides with snow berms. The airstrip included one runway oriented north/south and an intersecting runway oriented east/west. Weather conditions at the time of the accident consisted of clear skies with ice pack haze. The sun was low on the horizon, resulting in shadows on the airstrip, and flat light conditions made it difficult to discern topographical features. The pedestrian reported that, just before the two pilots boarded the airplane, he told the captain that he would position himself alongside the airstrip so that he could photograph the airplane at departure. As the airplane back-taxied before takeoff, the pedestrian positioned himself clear of the airstrip and behind a 3- to 4-ft-tall snow berm. He said that, as the airplane's takeoff progressed, it did not climb as quickly as it had during previous departures and that the last thing he remembered before the collision was seeing the left wing getting lower to the ground as the airplane began a left turn and flew toward him while continuing to accelerate. A security video camera recorded the accident sequence, and the recording supported the pedestrian's account of the sequence of events. Although the captain reported that he climbed the airplane before initiating a left turn, the review of the video revealed that the flight crew operated the airplane at a low altitude and along a flightpath that placed it in dangerous proximity to the pedestrian (which was inconsistent with federal regulations) and left no margin to avoid the collision with him. A postaccident examination of the airplane revealed substantial damage to the left wing and left aileron. The pedestrian sustained a serious head and neck injuries because of the collision, and he was subsequently medevacked to Anchorage, Alaska for treatment. Probable Cause: The flight crew's improper decision to deliberately operate the airplane at low altitude and along a flightpath that resulted in a collision with a pedestrian after takeoff. Contributing to the accident was the pedestrian's proximity to the runway.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ANC18LA027 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Deadhorse, AK; March 2018 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft was performing Israir Airlines flight 6H716 from Budapest to Tel Aviv, Israel. During pushback the tow truck reportedly began emitting smoke, which supposedly entered the aircraft cabin. Cabin crew members opened the rear emergency exit(s) to allow evacuation through slides. During the evacuation, the rear slides were unstable because of the jet blast of the operating engines. Approximately 2.5 minutes passed from the opening of the slide to the shutdown of the engines. One passenger fell from the evacuation slide and suffered a serious head injury.  Causes In the course of its investigation, the IC concluded that the direct cause of the accident was the lack of communication from the cabin crew on duty in the aft galley to the rest of the crew, and identified the presence of the panic on board as an indirect cause, which was caused by the misjudgement of the origin of the smoke. In addition to those above, the IC presumes the following contributing factors: â passengersâ fatigue; â malfunction of the pushback tug; â ambiguity of the emergency procedures; â initiation of an evacuation without approval; â late reaction of the flight crew to the situation.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Hungary Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 years and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: http://airportal.hu/veszcsuszdakon-uritettek-ki-egy-repulogepet-ferihegyen/  https://mno.hu/belfold/sulyos-incidens-a-ferihegyen-2455450  http://www.kbsz.hu/j25/hu/legi-kozlekedes/kbsz-altal-vizsgalt-esemenyek-2014/22-legi-kozlekedes/legi-kozlekedes/2344-20180323 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  7 June 2009 D-AHLR Hapag-Lloyd 0 S of Aosta min Fumes/smoke/odor event 12 March 2013 OK-TVP Travel Service Airlines 0 Katowice Int'l Airport- KTW/EPKT, Pyrzowice non Runway excursion Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates23-Mar-2018 12:19 bbmaci Added 23-Mar-2018 12:26 harro Updated [Aircraft type, Cn, Operator, Location, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, ]23-Mar-2018 12:28 harro Updated [Embed code, ]02-May-2023 20:09 harro Updated 17-Jul-2023 08:05 harro Updated Corrections or additions? ...

The pilot reported that, after exiting instrument meteorological conditions during a circling approach, he was ""a little above"" the normal glidepath; as the airplane crossed the approach end of the runway, the airplane began to sink rapidly and drift to the left. He added power to initiate a go-around, but the airplane continued to sink and landed with the left main landing gear off the left side of the runway. As the airplane became airborne again, he attempted to retract the landing gear, ""but the handle was locked in place."" He noticed that the left and right main landing gear extension lights were illuminated, but the nose landing gear light was not. The pilot noticed a positive rate of climb and decided to fly to King Salmon Airport, Alaska. The pilot reported that, while en route to the alternate airport, a passenger reported that they smelled smoke, so he turned off electrical equipment. A pilot-rated passenger assisted with circuit breaker troubleshooting before turning on the battery again for communications. He instructed the pilot-rated passenger to visually examine the landing gear; the passenger reported that the left main landing gear was extended without damage and the right main landing gear was ""bent back,"" with damage to the right flap with fuel leaking from the wing.  After contacting the alternate airport's tower, the pilot reported that he declared an emergency and provided a safety brief to the passengers. He added that, at the alternate airport, he performed an instrument landing system approach, and over the approach end of the runway, he reduced power, feathered the propellers, and moved both fuel levers to fuel cutoff. During landing, the right main landing gear collapsed, the right wing settled onto the runway, and the airplane began to pull to the right. The pilot added left rudder to maintain the runway centerline and the airplane came to rest on the runway. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing. Probable Cause and Findings: The pilot's failure to maintain an adequate approach path and runway centerline during the initial landing, which resulted in a hard landing to the left of the runway and damage to the landing gear and wing.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: GAA18CA187 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  KTVA   Location  Images: photo (c) Alaska Department of Transportation; King Salmon Airport, AK (AKN/PAKN); 29 March 2018 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Arriving on final approach at the airport, the limited visibility prompted the crew to carry out a go-around and divert to Bamako. In the early afternoon, judging that the conditions were improving, the crew took off again and made it to the final approach on the laterite runway 07R of Gao.  With visibility reduced to 3,000 metres and the runway difficult to spot, the crew requested Gao air traffic control to mark the runway threshold with flashing lights. The crew only perceived this secondary runway late and made corrections to line up on the runway axis on short final. As a result, the approach was not stabilized. This unstable final approach resulted in a late and poorly controlled flare. The aircraft touched down on the runway and bounced back three times. One or more of these contacts with the runway produced excessive forces on the nose gear and its fracture. The aircraft slid over the front of the fuselage for 500 metres before coming to rest. The crew shut down the engines and systems, then evacuated the aircraft on their own. Causes of the event The causes of this event are environmental, organizational and human factors. The following factors contributed to the late detection of the active runway: - reduced visibility conditions due to haze (less than 3,000 metres); - the absence of contrast of the laterite runway with the surrounding terrain; - the lack of effectiveness of portable lighting installed at the runway threshold at the crew's request. The following factors contributed to an unstable final approach and a late and poorly controlled flare: - the focus of attention on the landing, leading to a poorly executed landing without a go-around; - operational pressure to deliver fresh food on time; - the emulation induced by the performance of another crew from the same company who may have landed earlier in Gao under the same conditions; - the fatigue accumulated by the sequence of flights and the weather conditions, which are conducive to errors of judgment and delays in decision-making; - the organisation of the cockpit not promoting synergy within the crew.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA-E Report number: E-2018-003-I Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The private pilot and passenger of the Cessna 150 sustained fatal injuries and the pilot and 4 passengers of the Cessna 525 were not injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed in the area. The Cessna 150 was departing on runway 15 at MZZ a local VFR personal flight and the Cessna 525 was landing on runway 22 after an IFR flight that originated from Jackson, Michigan, USA. Examination of the accident site showed that the Cessna 150 had struck the empennage of the Cessna 525 at the intersection of runways 15 and 22. Evidence at the intersection showed that the airplanes came together perpendicular to each other. The Cessna 150 then impacted the ground and a post-crash fire ensued. The Cessna 525 continued to roll out on runway 22.  Witnesses stated that they heard the Cessna 150 pilot on runway 15 UNICOM frequency. The surviving pilot of the Cessna 525 stated that he did not see the departing Cessna 150 while he was on a straight-in approach to runway 22, nor did he see the 150 during the landing roll. He stated that he did not recall making a radio call on UNICOM, but did utilize his on board Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) system while on approach. He stated that the TCAS did not show any traffic on the airport.  The reported weather at MZZ at the time of the accident was VFR with 4 miles of visibility due to haze. Also, at the departure and arrival ends of runway 15/33, there was a sign stating, ""Traffic Using Runway 4/22 Cannot Be Seen, Monitor Unicom 122.7."" At the departure and arrival ends of runway 4/22, there was a sign stating, ""Traffic Using 15/33 cannot Be Seen, Monitor Unicom 122.7."" The MZZ airport does not have a control tower. Probable Cause: The failure of both pilots to see and avoid the other airplane as they converged on intersecting runways.

The aircraft skidded 278 m along the runway before it came to rest. The aircraft carried medical isotopes for a hospital. The crew was uninjured, while the aircraft suffered damage to the nose wheel mechanism, both propellers, belly and the trailing edge of the flaps. The crew explained that the landing gear collapsed when the aircraft landed. They experienced that the aircraft banked slightly to the left just after landing and the commander, who was PM (Pilot Monitoring), reacted by placing his hand on the landing gear handle to check if it was completely down. Furthermore, he explained that he retracted the handle in a reflex action, but quickly placed it down again. According to the crew, this led the landing gear to retract resulting in the aircraft taking the ground with its belly.  The NSIA has attempted to find a link between the crew's explanation and the investigation findings, but without finding a complete match. A thorough inspection of the landing gear was carried out after the accident without any significant technical issues located in the system. The NSIA believes that the landing gear was either in transit when they landed or that it was completely retracted, which resulted in a belly landing.METAR: 07:50 UTC / 09:50 local time: METAR ENZV 090750Z 17009KT 3000 DZ BR OVC003 06/05Q10067 TEMPO 1400 -DZ BR=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIBN Report number: 2021/13 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NRK  AIBN  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The plane landed safely at the second approach 15 minutes later. No personal injuries were reported.  The aircraft departed Jeju, South Korea at 20:24 hours with the captain as Pilot Flying on the leg to Osaka-Kansai. The landing briefing commenced at around 20:59 prior to the descent did not include information regarding a tailwind at the time of the landing. As the aircraft had commenced the ILS approach to runway 06L, the controller reported wind from 030Â° at 3 kt. Both the autopilot and the auto-throttle of the aircraft were disengaged at around a radio altitude of 1,200 ft. In addition, the aircraft continued a stabilized approach. The captain, who was assuming that a landing would be made with a tailwind component, planned to put the thrust levers to their idle position earlier than usual when performing a flare in order to prevent that a touchdown would be long down on the runway. At around 21:32:54, the captain moved the thrust levers to their idle position along with initiating the flare at 2Â° pitch angle at a radio altitude of about 30 ft. Although the captain tried to continue raising the nose and to reduce the rate of descent, the timing of such maneuvers was slightly delayed. Reducing the rate of descent was infeasible because the thrust levers had already been set to their idle position. The captain tried to reduce the rate of descent of the aircraft by pulling the control column further. The first officer, who felt the rate of descent was large, pulled the control column to reduce the rate of descent without making any call-out. Having noticed the operation of the FO, the captain kept the control column so as to follow the FO's operation. At around 21:32:57, the right main landing gear of the aircraft touched down at pitch angle of about 3.5Â°, and all spoilers began to deploy when the auto speed brake was activated. Subsequently, after the left main landing gear had touched down, the aircraft bounced. The maximum vertical acceleration recorded in the FDR during this period was 1.87 G. The captain, who was unable to predict the degree of the bounce and assumed that the impact accompanied by the touchdown after the bounce would be hard, executed a go-around maneuver. The pitch angle of the aircraft immediately before executing the go-around was about 5Â°. The aircraft started climbing positively at about 10Â° pitch angle after its both main landing gears touched down again approximately one second after it had executed the go-around.  The aircraft landed on runway 06L conducting the ILS approach again after flying in accordance with the missed approach procedure. Both the flight crew members did not recognize that the aircraft had struck the runway until the scratch marks were found on the lower aft fuselage by mechanics after the aircraft arrived at the allotted parking spot. The scrape mark on the runway was 15 meters long. PROBABLE CAUSES In this accident, it is highly probable that the lower aft fuselage of the aircraft was damaged with contacting the runway because its pitch angle became too high during the go-around following the bounce at the time of the landing. Regarding the pitch angle became too high, it is somewhat likely that because the Captain, who thought the impact after the bounce would become hard and tried to avoid the second touchdown, performed large nose up maneuver.METAR: 12:30 UTC / 21:33 local time: RJBB 091230Z 01003KT 9999 FEW030 BKN045 13/08 Q1020 NOSIG=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JTSB Report number: AA2019-5 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: https://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl?a=20180410-00000039-jij-soci  https://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl?a=20180410-00050070-yom-soci  Flightradar24   Location  Images: photo (c) JTSB; Osaka-Kansai International Airport (KIX/RJBB); 09 April 2018 photo (c) Flightradar24; Osaka-Kansai International Airport (KIX); 09 April 2018 photo (c) JTSB; Osaka-Kansai International Airport (KIX/RJBB); 09 April 2018 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot, the only occupant onboard, sustained minor injuries, and the airplane sustained substantial damage. The airplane was being operated by Hageland Aviation Services, Inc., as a Ravn Connect cargo/mail flight. The flight originated about 07:58, from the Utqiagvik (formerly Barrow) Airport, Alaska, and it was destined for Atqasuk, which is located about 58 miles south. The area between Utqiagvik and Atqasuk consists of remote, flat, featureless, tundra-covered terrain, which is snow-covered in April. Weather conditions at the time of departure consisted of clear skies, 9 miles visibility, and a light wind. After takeoff, the airplane climbed to 2,500 feet msl, and proceeded southbound towards Atqasuk. The pilot said that as the airplane neared Atqasuk, with the autopilot engaged, the airplane descended to about 1,500 feet msl, but then he noticed an area of low fog around Atqasuk. He said that when the airplane was about two miles from the airport, he heard the audible autopilot disengagement annunciator tone sound, which was immediately followed by the pilot's control column pitching forward. The pilot said that he was unable to pull the control column back, and the airplane subsequently descended into instrument meteorological conditions. He said that the airplane continued to descend into the fog, then it struck the snow-covered tundra, and nosed over. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the wings, fuselage, and empennage. A North Slope Borough Search and Rescue helicopter pilot told the NTSB that while en route from Utqiagvik to the accident site he encountered ice fog, reduced visibility, and flat light conditions that made it difficult to discern topographical features on the snow-covered tundra. He noted that as the flight continued, both pilots noticed ice beginning to accumulate on the helicopter's windscreen, so the decision was made to abort the search and rescue flight, and the helicopter returned to Utqiagvik. A search team from Atqasuk eventually reached the accident site on snow machines and transported the pilot to Atqasuk. Probable Cause and Findings: The pilot's decision to continue a visual flight rules flight into an area of instrument meteorological conditions and his subsequent failure to level the airplane after the autopilot disconnected, which resulted in a collision with terrain.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ANC18LA031 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: KTVA  Flightaware  FAA   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; near Atqasuk Airport, AK (ATK); April 2018; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; near Atqasuk Airport, AK (ATK); April 2018; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

A fire ensued. The pilot, who was the sole occupant, died in the crash. Night instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident, and no flight plan was filed for the flight, which departed Richmond-Chesterfield County Airport (FCI), Virginia, about 20:35 and was destined for Shenandoah Valley Regional Airport (SHD), Virginia. According to a friend of the pilot, the pilot had ""a couple of drinks"" while they were preparing dinner. The pilot left her home about 19:30. The pilot's friend thought that the pilot would be going to a hotel because it was getting dark, but FCI security video showed that the pilot arrived at the airport at 20:02 and walked to the airplane at 20:04. The pilot then walked around the airplane for about 3 minutes, boarded the airplane, closed the main cabin door, and initiated the engine start sequence at 20:17. About 2 minutes later, the airplane began to taxi to the departure end of runway 15 and then taxied back to the departure end of runway 33. The takeoff roll began on runway 33 at 20:33. The airport security video showed the windsock, which indicated that the wind favored a departure from runway 15. According to an airport line service employee, the airplane departed with a tailwind. The employee also stated that the pilot did not communicate on the Unicom frequency. According to air traffic control data provided by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), a radar target identified as the accident airplane departed FCI and reached a maximum altitude of about 11500 ft mean sea level (msl) at 20:40. The airplane then began to descend and, at 20:44, leveled off at an altitude of about 4300 ft (which was below the minimum safe altitude of 5700 ft msl for SHD). The airplane remained at 4300 ft until 20:53, when it began a descending left turn. The last two radar returns were 5 seconds apart and showed the airplane at 3300 ft and 2800 msl, which indicated that the airplane was descending about 6000 ft per minute. Radar contact was lost at 20:54. Throughout the flight, the pilot did not have any contact with air traffic control. The FAA prohibits any person from acting or as a crewmember of a civil aircraft while having 0.040 gm/dl or more ethanol in the blood. In addition, the regulation states that no person can act as a crewmember of an aircraft within 8 hours after the consumption of any alcoholic beverage. Probable cause: ""The pilot's loss of control while operating in night instrument meteorological conditions as a result of spatial disorientation. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's decision to operate an airplane after consuming alcohol and his resulting intoxication, which degraded the pilot's judgment and decision-making.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA18FA127 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  cavalierdaily.com   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Crozet, VA; 16 April 2018; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Crozet, VA; 16 April 2018; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Crozet, VA; 16 April 2018; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Crozet, VA; 15 April 2018; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The forecast weather at Newquay was for overcast cloud at 400 - 500 ft with a gusty crosswind of approximately 20 kt. The co-pilot was pilot flying for the Newquay sector. The takeoff, cruise and descent were uneventful. During the cruise the commander obtained updated weather via the ATIS for Newquay, which gave landing runway 12, the surface wind 210/16 and cloud broken at 400 ft. The flight crew briefed for the approach, discussing the threat of turbulence on final and the potential for a go-around. The pilots planned to use flap 15 for the final approach because no gusts were reported on the ATIS, and to set the propeller condition levers to max in case a go-around was required. The aircraft was established on final for runway 12 at 8 nm and the co-pilot disconnected the autopilot at approximately 500 ft. At approximately 400 ft, the aircraft became displaced from the runway centreline and the co-pilot elected to go around. The goaround was uneventful and the aircraft was repositioned for a second approach. During the downwind leg the commander made a PA to reassure the passengers then briefed the co-pilot to keep the autopilot engaged until slightly later in the approach and to ensure the speed remained between the VREF and VCLIMB speed bugs. The second approach was stable until approximately 50 ft. The tower gave the surface wind as 190Â°/20 kt. At approximately 50 ft the co-pilot reduced power to flight idle to control the airspeed, although neither pilot was aware that the power had been reduced this much. At approximately 30 ft above the runway, the aircraft started to sink rapidly and the commander called ""power, power, power"". The co-pilot increased power and pitched up to arrest the rate of descent, but the aircraft landed firmly, striking its tail on the runway. The aircraft bounced and the commander took control. Observing the ÂTOUCHED RUNWAYÂ light he elected to continue the landing. The aircraft landed and taxied to the gate without further incident. Subsequently one cabin crew member reported minor back pain. No other injuries were reported. Damage was found to several skin panels, frames, stringers and aft pressure bulkhead. Conclusion: ""The tailstrike occurred because the pilot flying reacted instinctively to the high sink rate by increasing pitch attitude and power, rather than increasing power only. The aircraft manufacturer recommends that operators provide annual recurrent training in pitch awareness for flight crew to establish the correct response to high sink rate near the ground.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: EW/G2018/04/09 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  4 January 2014 G-JECX Flybe 0 Paris-Orly Airport (ORY/LFPO) unk Hydraulic system problem Images: photo (c) AAIB; Newquay-Cornwall Airport (NQY/EGHQ); April 2018 photo (c) NTSB; Newquay-Cornwall Airport (NQY/EGHQ); 17 April 2018 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft, a Boeing 737-700, originated from New York-La Guardia Airport at 10:43 for a flight to Dallas-Love Field, Texas. About 11:04, when the aircraft was climbing through FL325, the no.1 engine (CFM56-7B24) suffered an uncontained failure. The flight crew noticed that the no.1 engine rpm dropped to zero, as did the oil pressure. The cabin altitude horn sounded and the aircraft experienced a sudden, uncommanded, left roll of a 41Â° bank angle. The pilots leveled the wing, donned their oxygen masks and initiated an emergency descent. The flight crew then requested air traffic control to give them vectors to the nearest suitable airport. As a result of the uncontained failure, a fan blade and parts of the engine cowling and engine air inlet cowl had separated. Debris impacted a window frame of row 14, causing the window and frame to break away. This resulted in a decompression of the aircraft. Additional debris impacted and damaged the leading edge of the left hand wing. The flight was vectored towards Philadelphia Airport, where the crew requested an extended final approach due to concerns of aircraft controllability. It was decided to land with flaps 5 for that reason, and an approach speed of 165 knots. The aircraft landed on runway 27L at 11:19 hours and the aircraft was stopped on a taxiway. ARFF services attended to the no.1 engine while injured passenger who was seated near the lost window was rushed to hospital. The passenger is reported to have died. Preliminary findings of the NTSB show that the no.13 fan blade of engine no.1 was missing. It appears to have broken away at the hub. There is evidence of metal fatigue in the area where the blade broke. Also, a part of the no.1 engine cowling was reported to have been found at Burnville, PA. Probable Cause: The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determines that the probable cause of this accident was a low-cycle fatigue crack in the dovetail of fan blade No. 13, which resulted in the fan blade separating in flight and impacting the engine fan case at a location that was critical to the structural integrity and performance of the fan cowl structure. This impact led to the in-flight separation of fan cowl components, including the inboard fan cowl aft latch keeper, which struck the fuselage near a cabin window and caused the window to depart from the airplane, the cabin to rapidly depressurize, and the passenger fatality.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NTSB/AAR-19/03 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Philadelphia International Airport, PA (PHL/KPHL); 17 April 2018; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Philadelphia International Airport, PA (PHL/KPHL); 17 April 2018; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Philadelphia International Airport, PA (PHL/KPHL); 17 April 2018; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Philadelphia International Airport, PA (PHL/KPHL); 17 April 2018; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; near  Burnville, PA; 18 April 2018; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; near  Burnville, PA; 18 April 2018; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Philadelphia International Airport, PA (PHL/KPHL); April 2018; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Philadelphia International Airport, PA (PHL/KPHL); 2018; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Philadelphia International Airport, PA (PHL/KPHL); 2018; (publicdomain) photo (c) Flightaware/Google; 17 April 2018 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft, an Airbus A330-323, had taken off from runway 26L at en route to London, U.K. The flight crew reported a no. 2 engine fire electronic centralized aircraft monitor (ECAM) indication at about 500 feet AGL, declared an emergency, shutdown the no. 2 engine, discharged both fire bottles, and initiated an air turn back to the departure airport. During the return the fire warning indication cleared, and the airplane made an uneventful overweight single engine landing on runway 27R at 18:34.  After landing, airport rescue and firefighting (ARFF) crews met the airplane on the runway and observed smoke and flames emanating from the no. 2 engine. ARFF sprayed the engine with fire retardant foam and extinguished the fire. The airplane was towed to the gate and the passengers disembarked. There were no injuries to the passengers or crew and the airplane sustained substantial damage. Probable Cause: The flight crewÂs delayed landing after an in-flight engine fire, which reignited after both fire bottles were discharged and resulted in substantial damage to an engine pylon. Contributing to the delayed landing was likely the flight crewÂs perception that the fire had been extinguished due to the disappearance of the primary engine fire warning indications after the fire detection loops were damaged and that a landing as soon as possible was not perceived to be necessary. Contributing to the duration of the fire was the contamination of an engine fire isolation system component which resulted in hydraulic fluid leaking into the designated engine fire zone after the engine was shutdown and the fire button was pressed.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA18LA163 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 years Download report:  Final report Sources: KCTV5  Flightradar24   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The Boeing 737-800 registered PK-LOO operated on a flight from Sultan Hasanuddin International Airport, Makassar. The Pilot in Command (PIC) acted as Pilot Flying (PF) and the Second in Command (SIC) acted as Pilot Monitoring (PM) on this flight. On board the flight were 181 persons, consisted of two pilots, five flight attendants and 174 passengers. The flight departed Makassar at 17:28 local time and cruised at an altitude of FL330. The flight until descent was uneventful. Prior to commencing their descent, the crew received the latest weather information from the Jalaluddin Tower controller: wind calm, visibility 2,500 meters, slight rain, cloud FEW CB (cumulonimbus) 800 feet and overcast 800 feet, temperature 26Â°C, dew point 24 Â°C, QNH 1008 hPa and QFE 1006 hPa with additional remarks of CB in the approach area. During the descent, at 18:28, Jalaluddin Tower advised the pilot to descend to 5,800 feet and issued a clearance to carry out a VOR/DME approach to runway 27. At 18:32, the Jalaluddin Tower controller informed the pilot that there was rain over the field and requested the aircrafts position. The PM acknowledged the information and reported that the aircraft was on final course runway 27. One minute later a pilot of an ATR aircraft that previously landed informed to JT892 that when they were making the approach, there was heavy rain in the final approach area. The PM acknowledged the information. There was no pilot discussion to anticipate the reported heavy rain. The Jalaluddin Tower controller informed the pilot that the wind direction was 150Â° with velocity of 7 knots, QNH 1008 hPa and issued landing clearance if the pilot was able to see the runway. The PM acknowledged the message and would inform when they were able to see the runway. The pilot requested for high intensity of runway lights and was informed that the runway light had been set to maximum intensity. At 18:34, the PM informed the Jalaluddin Tower controller that the runway was in sight. The Jalaluddin Tower controller then issued landing clearance for JT892 since the controller was able to see the aircraft landing lights. At 18:40, the aircraft touched down, the autobrake operated, the spoiler automatically deployed and the PF selected the engine thrust reversers. The pilots felt that suddenly the rain became very heavy and they were only able to see the runway lights on the left side of the runway. The crew felt an impact and then the aircraft stopped off the left side of the runway at approximately 1,200 meters from the beginning runway 27. The pilot attempted to contact the Jalaluddin Tower controller but this was not received by the controller. The Jalaluddin Tower controller also attempted to contact the pilot, but the pilot did not receive the controllers message. The Jalaluddin Tower controller could not clearly see the aircraft position however, the controller aware that the aircraft experienced an abnormality. The controller notified the Airport rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) using radio because the crash bell had not been connected to the ARFF station since the ARFF station moved to the new location a few months before.

The crew requested to ""push and hold"" which was granted by the ground controller who added, ""push across to the east line, abeam stand 50R. do not start engines"". These instructions were repeated to the groundcrew. During the pushback, ATC informed the crew of a new CTOT, very close to the present time. The crew informed the groundcrew and advised them that they would start engines after the pushback. Approaching the end of the pushback, the flight crew felt the tug stop abruptly. The commander asked the groundcrew if everything was alright and the groundcrew responded that they had pushed the aircraft too close to the blast fence and were going to pull it forward. The Senior Cabin Crew member called the flight deck on the interphone and informed them that she and the cabin crew seated at the rear of the aircraft felt that the tail of the aircraft had struck something. The commander checked with the groundcrew, who thought it hadnÂt, but the commander contacted engineering who sent out an engineer. On inspection, damage was found to the trailing edge of the left elevator. The commander called the ground controller and informed  them of the collision. The Fire Service attended and, following an inspection, determined that there was no immediate danger to the aircraft or passengers, which was also confirmed by the engineer. The aircraft was towed to Stand 50L and the passengers disembarked using the air stairs. Discussion The clearance was to carry out a pushback of the aircraft to abeam Stand 50R and the headset operator believed this would be when the pilotÂs window was in line with the stand. The pushback continued until the elevator struck the blast fence but the relative positions of the pilotÂs window and the stand were not determined at this point. The poor weather, light and poor clarity of the taxi line as seen by the tug driver meant that all his attention was focussed on his task. This and his restricted viewpoint from the nose of the aircraft prevented him from monitoring the actions of the headset operator and being aware of the proximity of the tail to the blast fence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: EW/G2018/04/18 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Delta 212 was taxing to gate B30 and following behind Endeavor 3413 as it  turned into gate B30.  The captain of Endeavor 3413 stated that he had stopped short of the gate to await the ground crew.  The captain of Delta 212 indicated that as they approached the airplane, he noticed that the wing walkers had stopped the Endeavor airplane prior to its gate, and so he stopped prior to entering the ramp area.  When the Endeavor airplane started to move forward into the gate, he began to slowly taxi behind it, however, the captain indicated that he lost sight of airplane out the right window.  He indicated that he turned slight to the left (away from Endeavor 3413) after his first officer advised him to provide additional clearance to ensure adequate separation.  After he thought they would be safety clear of the airplane, he then turned back onto the taxiway centerline.

Delta 212 was taxing to gate B30 and following behind Endeavor 3413 as it  turned into gate B30.  The captain of Endeavor 3413 stated that he had stopped short of the gate to await the ground crew.  The captain of Delta 212 indicated that as they approached the airplane, he noticed that the wing walkers had stopped the Endeavor airplane prior to its gate, and so he stopped prior to entering the ramp area.  When the Endeavor airplane started to move forward into the gate, he began to slowly taxi behind it, however, the captain indicated that he lost sight of airplane out the right window.  He indicated that he turned slight to the left (away from Endeavor 3413) after his first officer advised him to provide additional clearance to ensure adequate separation.  After he thought they would be safety clear of the airplane, he then turned back onto the taxiway centerline. As the airplane continued taxiing to the gate, the Delta flight crew heard over ramp control that they had struck Endeavor 3413. After parking, both airplanes were inspected and it was found that Delta 212's right winglet sustained minor damage and Endeavor 3413 sustained substantial damage to its horizontal and vertical stabilizer. Probable Cause: The failure of the captain of Delta 212 to ensure adequate clearance while taxiing behind Endeavor 3413.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA18CA165A Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The first officer, who was line flying under supervision, was Pilot Flying while the captain, who had a Flight Instructor Rating, was Pilot Monitoring on the flight. The flight was uneventful, the weather conditions were favourable, and the crew requested a visual approach for a landing on runway 10 at Marrakech, which was received at 5NM from the ODALO point, allowing the crew to have a long final approach of about 20NM before landing. The ILS frequency was selected for both pilots, while the FD was switched off when the clearance was received for a visual approach. At 200ft agl the aircraft was below glide path, the first officer corrected by increasing thrust without controlling the vertical path being, causing the aircraft to be high on the glide path. The trainee first officer then reduced thrust (almost to idle) to catch up with the glide path by descending to the runway at 100 feet above ground level, with a very high descent rate. It was at this point that the instructor pilot had to make a decision to either take control to correct the course, or abort the landing and do a go-around as the approach was no longer stabilised and the first officer's corrections were excessive. As the first officer had 500 hours on the type, the captain decided not to take control. Thrust was increased to decrease the rate of descent. The aircraft then made a hard landing with bounce. When the wheels touched the ground during the landing, the captain finally decided to take control. He also decided to reduce thrust further, to avoid a long landing after the bounce. As the aircraft was at a higher height than the recommended flare height, this manoeuvre was poorly executed with a nose-up attitude exceeding the values required for a safe landing. Despite the pilot's action on the control column to remedy the situation, this did not prevent the aft fuselage from contacting the runway. Probable causes of the accident: - Inappropriate execution of the landing procedure by the flight crew; - Inappropriate correction by the first officer to catch up with the landing path;  - Delayed reaction by the captain to rectify the situation;  - Inadequate response by the first officer to the landing procedure; - Late reaction by captain to remedy this situation; - Inadequate decision by the captain to continue the landing. Contributing factors: - Lack of experience in the first officer; - Unfamiliar terrain for the first officer; - Lack of experience of the Type Rating Instructor pilot.METAR: 12:00 UTC /  local time: GMMX 021200Z 36004KT 310V090 9999 FEW020 18/06 Q1017 NOSIG=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Maroc Report number: D.BEA.002.AIG/01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  28 August 2019 OO-JAY TUI fly Belgium 0 Eindhoven Airport, Noord-Brabant min 27 February 2023 OO-JAY TUI fly Belgium, opf TUI fly Netherlands 0 Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS/EHAM) unk Tailstrike Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates17-Oct-2024 18:19 ASN Updated [Cn, Source, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All nine occupants suffered fatal injuries. The aircraft was attached to the Puerto Rico Air National Guard and had been undergoing routine maintenance in Savannah before heading to the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG) at Davis Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona. The MA had been at Savannah for almost a month, since 9 April 2018, to undergo prescheduled fuel cell maintenance and unscheduled work on engine number one by 156 AW maintenance personnel using the facilities of the 165th Airlift Wing.  During takeoff roll, engine no.1 RPM fluctuated and did not provide normal RPM when the captain advanced the throttle lever into the flight range for takeoff. Approximately eight seconds prior to aircraft rotation, engine no.1 RPM and torque significantly decayed, which substantially lowered thrust. The fluctuation on roll and significant performance decay went unrecognized by the crew until rotation, when the captain commented on aircraft control challenges and the aircraft veered left and nearly departed the runway into the grass before it achieved flight.  As the crew retracted the landing gear, they identified the engine no.1 RPM and torque malfunction and the captain called for engine shutdown. However, the crew failed to complete the Takeoff Continued After Engine Failure procedure, the Engine Shutdown procedure, and the After Takeoff checklist as directed by the Flight Manual, and the aircraft's flaps remained at 50 percent. Additionally, the captain banked left into the inoperative engine, continued to climb, and varied left and right rudder inputs. At an altitude of approximately 900 feet mean sea level and 131 knots indicated air speed, the captain input over nine degrees of left rudder, the aircraft skidded left, the left wing stalled, and the aircraft departed controlled flight and impacted the terrain on Georgia State Highway 21. USAF AIB CONCLUSION: ""After a comprehensive investigation into this mishap, I find, by a preponderance of the evidence, the cause of the mishap was MP1Âs improper application of left rudder, which resulted in a subsequent skid below three-engine minimum controllable airspeed, a left-wing stall, and the MAÂs departure from controlled flight. Additionally, I find, by a preponderance of the evidence, the MCÂs failure to adequately prepare for emergency actions, the MCÂs failure to reject the takeoff, the MCÂs failure to properly execute appropriate after takeoff and engine shutdown checklists and procedures, and the Mishap MaintainersÂ failure to properly diagnose and repair engine number one substantially contributed to the mishap.""METAR: 14:53 UTC / 10:53 local time: KSAV 021453Z VRB06KT 10SM FEW035 FEW250 24/14 A3035 RMK AO2 SLP277 T02440139 5300915:33 UTC / 11:33 local time: KSAV 021533Z 04008KT 10SM FEW035 FEW250 26/14 A3035 RMK AO2 T0256013915:53 UTC / 11:53 local time: KSAV 021553Z VRB03KT 10SM FEW015 FEW035 SCT250 26/14 A3034 RMK AO2 SLP274 FU FEW015 T02560139Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: USAF AIB Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: WBTV   Location  Images: photo (c) IAFF574 Savannah; Port Wentworth, GA; 02 May 2018 photo (c) USAF; Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport, GA (SAV); 02 May 2018 photo (c) USAF; near Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport, GA (SAV); 02 May 2018 photo (c) USAF; Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport, GA (SAV); 02 May 2018 photo (c) USAF; Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport, GA (SAV); 02 May 2018 photo (c) USAF; Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport, GA (SAV); 02 May 2018 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...
