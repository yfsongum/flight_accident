The pilot decided to veer to the runway intersection. Unable to decelerate, the aircraft ran down a  5 meter embankment and went through a fence. It hit a barbecue stand, destroying it and slightly injuring the vendor. The aircraft suffered serious damage to its wings. Contributing factors a. Human Factor (1) Physiological - Did not contribute. (2) Psychological - Contributed By the presence, as a contributing factor, of the perceptive aspects, the decision making and the overconfidence of the crew; and as suspected aspects, the complacency and attention. b. Material Factor Did not contribute. c. Operational Factor (1) Adverse Weather Conditions - Contributed The rain that fell over Congonhas, moments before the accident, contributed to the occurrence of aquaplaning due to the high speed of the aircraft, culminating with the loss of control on the ground. (2) Poor Cabin Coordination - Contributed The lack of assertiveness of the co-pilot in not commanding the flight or taking commands when checking that the aircraft was outside the appropriate parameters for landing in the existing conditions. (3) Weak Judgment - Contributed For not performing a go around as a solution to the mistakes and failures committed during the approach, among which we can mention the excessively high descent gradient, the excessive speed, the non perception of hydroplaning and the cutting of the right engine. (4) Deficient Planning - Contributed Even informed that the runway was wet, the crew members did not outline any reaction in order to replan the procedures to be followed, adapting them to the new landing conditions, especially with regard to possible aquaplaning. (5) Little experience in the aircraft - contributed The pilot's limited experience in the aircraft influenced the mistakes made on the final approach and landing. (6) Poor Oversight - Contrived The company allowed a pilot without an employment relationship and without an adequate adaptation to the aircraft to exercise the function of pilot, which influenced the errors made during landingAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: CENIPA Report number: RF075/CENIPA/2005 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: Departamento de AviaÃ§Ã£o Civil (DAC)   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The 21 occupants aboard the airplane were killed. The accident airplane had undergone a detail six (D6) maintenance check between the night of January 6 and the morning of January 7, 2003. During this check the elevator cable tension was adjusted. In the process the elevator control system was incorrectly rigged, restricted the airplaneÂs elevator travel to 7Âº airplane nose down, or about one-half of the normal downward travel. This error was not detected prior to release to service. The airplane returned to service on the morning of January 7 and flew a total of nine flight legs before the accident flight. At 08:37 the aircraft was ready for taxi for a flight to Greenville-Spartanburg Airport, South Carolina, USA. At 08:46 the flight was cleared for takeoff from runway 18R. One minute later, immediately after the landing gear had been retracted, the nose pitched up to 20Â°. Both crew members reacted with surprise and the captain asked the first officer to help him. Both flight crew then attempted forcefully push the nose down. The nose continued to pitch up to 54Â° and the stall warning horn sounded. The aircraft's nose dropped and it rolled 127Â° to the left. The airplaneÂs roll attitude then stabilized at about 20Âº left wing down; the pitch attitude began to increase. About 08:47:24 the airplane rolled right through wings level, and the pitch attitude increased to about -5Âº. The nose dropped again and the airplane struck a US Airways maintenance hangar and came to rest about 1650 feet east of the runway 18R centerline and about 7600 feet beyond the runway 18R threshold.  It appeared that, aside from the limit nose down elevator travel, the aircraft had an excessive aft center of gravity due to substantially inaccurate weight and balance calculations. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The airplaneÂs loss of pitch control during takeoff.  The loss of pitch control resulted from the incorrect rigging of the elevator control system compounded by the airplaneÂs aft center of gravity, which was substantially aft of the certified aft limit. Contributing to the cause of the accident was: (1) Air MidwestÂs lack of oversight of the work being performed at the Huntington, West Virginia, maintenance station; (2) Air MidwestÂs maintenance procedures and documentation; (3) Air MidwestÂs weight and balance program at the time of the accident; (4) the Raytheon Aerospace quality assurance inspectorÂs failure to detect the incorrect rigging of the elevator system; (5) the FAAÂs average weight assumptions in its weight and balance program guidance at the time of the accident; and (6) the FAAÂs lack of oversight of Air MidwestÂs maintenance program and its weight and balance program.""METAR: 12:51 UTC / 07:51 local time: KCLT 081251Z 22006KT 10SM SCT140 BKN250 03/M07 A2975 RMK AO2 SLP075 T00331072=13:51 UTC / 08:51 local time: KCLT 081351Z 23007KT 10SM SCT140 BKN250 04/M06 A2976 RMK AO2 SLP079 T00391061=14:51 UTC / 09:51 local time: KCLT 081451Z 24008KT 210V290 10SM FEW140 BKN250 07/M04 A2977 RMK AO2 SLP083 T00671044 53008=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NTSB/AAR-04-01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   NTSB  ALPA Submission to the NTSB on Air Midwest Flight 5481 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  29 November 1997 C-FYSJ Ministic Air Island Lake, Manitoba Location  Images: photo (c) Lookout2; Charlotte-Douglas International Airport, NC (CLT); 08 January 2003; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) NTSB; Charlotte-Douglas International Airport, NC (CLT); January 2003 photo (c) Aviation Safety Network photo (c) Andrew Thon; Charlotte-Douglas International Airport, NC (CLT/KCLT); 2012 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

It departed Chiclayo at 08:17 and climbed to its assigned cruising altitude of FL190, which was reached approx. ten minutes after takeoff. The F-28 followed the V-3 airway, heading 075deg until 08:32. The crew then turned to the left heading 060deg, maintaining FL190 until 08:36. The flight then descended to FL130. After reaching that altitude five minutes later, the crew extended the speedbrakes in order to decelerate from 280 knots to 210 knots. Fifty seconds later, with the speedbrakes still extended, the crew turned to a heading of 135deg, aligning the plane with Chachapoyas' runway 13. The turn was accomplished in 45 seconds with a 30deg bank angle course change in 45 seconds. Shortly afterwards the Fellowship struck Cerro Coloque at an altitude of 10350 feet. Rescue workers found the wreckage two days after the crash. Until 1995 this F-28 was used as the Peruvian Presidential plane. PROBABLE ROOT CAUSES: 1.- PROBABLE MAIN CAUSE. The probable cause of the accident of the aircraft Fokker F-28, MK1000, OB-1396 of the company TANS-PERU, is the Impact Into Terrain without Loss of Control - CFIT (Controlled Flight Into Terrain) caused by complacency (overconfidence) and lack of effective communication between the technical crew, which leads to the total loss of situational awareness. 2.- PROBABLE SECONDARY CAUSES 2.1 Lack of compliance with Standard Operating Procedures. The CVR transcript shows that the Technical Crew was not alert, nor did they make any operational indication such as breafing or check list about the descent to the Chachapoyas airfield. 2.2 Lack of Crew Resource Management (CRM) There is no formal operational communication, in the CVR hearing there is a lot of informality and many comments out of place for a professional technical operation. 2.3 Loss of Situational Awareness. From the CVR hearing it can be extracted that the crew due to complacency (overconfidence) did not comply with the rules and procedures established for the operation of this route and airport. The alertness of the Technical Crew was not adequate for the operation phase. 3.- CONTRIBUTING FACTORS 3.1 Death of the Co-Pilot's father, 4 days before the date of the flight, could contribute as a stress, fatigue and depression agent, which could influence his professional performance. 3.2 The delay in the crew's payments and/or bonuses could have caused a stressful situation, which in the short, medium or long term contributes to fatigue, thus decreasing professional performance, which would affect flight safety. 3.3 Organizational system and operational environment. The constant changes of management personnel cause labor instability within the company, a situation that could be an agent of stress that affects human performance in any field. 4.- CONTRIBUTING HUMAN ERRORS The following Human Errors were observed in the analysis of the performance of this flight: 1) Poor judgment 2) Poor planning 3) Inadequate monitoring 4) Poor visual perspective 5) Poor visual perception 6) Operational complacency 7) Omitted procedures 8) Disorientation due to loss of situational awarenessMETAR: 13:00 UTC / 08:00 local time: SPPY 091300Z VRB02KT 9999 BKN015 SCT100 13/12 Q1028 PP000 TMN:12.5=14:00 UTC / 09:00 local time: SPPY 091400Z VRB03KT 9999 BKN018 SCT100 15/12 Q1028 PP000=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIAA Report number: CIAA-ACCID-001-2003 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) via W.

The aircraft climbed to FL 340 and was then cleared to FL 360 as it progressed along airway A332. As the flight proceeded, it encountered intermittent light to occasionally moderate turbulence and the crew made repeated requests for a higher altitude through Air Traffic Control, but the requests were not approved. A little more than half way into the flight, the aircraft's track began to converge obliquely with a cold frontal system extending southwest through the Hawaiian Islands, and the aircraft encountered headwinds of more than 100 knots approximately 30 degrees right of the aircraft's track. Approximately 4 hours 17 minutes into the flight, the aircraft was operating in the tops of clouds with good visibility when a passenger and her attendant left their seats to use the lavatory located in the rear of the aircraft. During this time the aircraft encountered moderate turbulence for a period of ten seconds or less and the attendant sustained a fractured ankle. Immediately following the event the crew requested and received approval for a climb to FL 370.

The Fokker took off from MÃ¡laga at 11:32 for a cross-Mediterranean flight to the Spanish enclave of Melilla. The aircraft climbed to its assigned cruising altitude of FL130. After contacting Melilla tower at 11:48 the crew were told to start the descent on their own discretion and to expect a runway 33 approach. A company flight was second on approach and requested runway 15 for landing. The ATC asked the crew of PH-FZE ""would you admit to use one five or do you prefer to keep on runway three three?"" The question was repeated and it took some time for the crew of PH-FZE to answer: ""We can accept runway one five"" at 11:56. They were then cleared to runway 15 with wind 250Â° and 11 kt. Four minutes later the aircraft was cleared to land with wind 240Â° at 12 kt varying between 210Â° and 300Â°. Due to the runway change, the pilot in command had decided to land with flaps 35Â° and a reference speed of 95 KIAS. The aircraft made some S-turns to lose altitude because it was a little high in the approach path. The airplane overflew the displaced threshold of runway 15 at approximately 15 ft. During the landing, the pilot in command realised that he could not engage the propeller ground idle/reverse, he said ""I have no reverse"" and applied brakes in an attempt to stop the aircraft. Later on, the co-pilot also applied brakes. During the landing roll the aircraft did not decelerate as expected. The wheel number 3 became locked and was deflated by a flat spot. The aircraft started to veer to the left of the runway until wheel number 1 left the runway at around 150 m before the end of the 1347 m long runway. The Fokker continued down an embankment of around 15 m in height and came to rest against the airport perimeter fence. The fuselage broke near seat rows 6 to 8, and the floor was heavily deformed between those rows. After the aircraft came to a stop, the captain had been injured, and the crew members were frozen for a while, until the flight observer pilot who was in the jump seat stated that the occupants should leave the aircraft immediately and started carrying out the on-ground emergency checklist. He pulled both fire handles and tried to close both fuel levers, but he was unable to close those levers. Then the captain turned on the evacuation lights. In the mean time, after a while and in absence of commands from the cockpit, the rear flight attendant instructed the passengers, who were all seated in the rear part of the cabin, to leave the aircraft through door 2R, which opened without problem. CAUSES: ""It is considered that the accident probably happened because of a combination of three factors: 1. An unstable approach that resulted in a higher than normal touchdown speed. 2. The inability to select propeller reverse due to the probable tripping of the circuit breaker FLIGHT IDLE SOLENOID 1 & 2 before or at touchdown.  3. The cross connection of the wheel speed transducer wire harness of wheels 3 and 4, which, due to heavy braking, produced a flat spot in wheel 3 and reduced the braking capability of wheel 4.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIAIAC Report number: A-002/2003 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 12 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: ComisiÃ³n de InvestigaciÃ³n de Accidentes e Incidentes de AviaciÃ³n Civil Technical Report A-003/2003   Location  Images: photo (c) Reinhard Schmidt, via Werner Fischdick; Palma de Mallorca Airport (PMI); June 2000 photo (c) Pedro de la Cruz, via Werner Fischdick; Palma de Mallorca Airport (PMI); May 2001 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane executed a few instrument approaches at Mathis Field and proceeded to Ducote Airpark. While on final approach at 100-200 feet the engine surged. Subsequently, the airplane's wings began to bank left and right. The airplane entered a descent rate of 1,300 feet/minute (fpm) about 1,100 feet above the ground. This rate of descent was associated with a decrease in airspeed from 130 knots to 92 knots over a span of 30 seconds. The airplane's rate of descent leveled off at the 1,300-fpm rate for 45 seconds before increasing to a 2,000 fpm descent rate.

The captain, who was the pilot flying and sitting in the right-hand seat, completed a normal takeoff. The flight took off from runway 27, over a lake. About 400 feet above ground level, the captain began a climbing right turn en route. During the turn, she had difficulty seeing the artificial horizon and concentrated on the aircraft's bank angle. The first officer called that the aircraft was in a 2000-feet-per-minute descent and took control. The aircraft struck the frozen surface of the lake, bounced, and became airborne again. The first officer retained control, and the captain attempted to feather the damaged right propeller. The first officer, believing that both propellers had sustained damage, force-landed the aircraft on the lake surface. The aircraft sustained substantial damage.

Despite numerous attempts, the copilot failed to contact Baucau ATS. The flight navigator then called Baucau Tower. A controller, who was present at Baucau aerodrome at the time, but not on operational duty, advised the flight crew that ATS was not available and that landing would be at the discretion of the flight crew. The pilot in command diverted the aircraft from the published inbound track to the Baucau NDB, and descended the aircraft below the published 10 NM MSA. He continued descending the aircraft through the commencement altitude for the published non-precision instrument approach for runway 14, and through the LSALT.  As the aircraft approached Baucau, the flight crew decided to conduct an overflight of the aerodrome before making a landing approach, and during the overflight, the flight crew realised that the runway was not where they expected it to be. It appeared that the crew did not use the Baucau NDB but used selected data from their instrument approach charts to formulate a user-defined non-precision approach using the onboard global positioning system (GPS). Adding to this, erroneous data on their Jeppesen charts meant the threshold of runway 14 was not where they thought it would be. Had the flight crew followed the non-precision runway 14 NDB approach procedure as published on either the CAD or Jeppesen charts, and not descended below the relevant MDA(H) until visual flight was assured, the position of the runway, as depicted on the Jeppesen charts would have been irrelevant.  During the overflight and the subsequent (first) landing approach, the flight crew realised that the runway was not where they expected it to be as it was depicted on the Jeppesen charts. The pilot in command discontinued the landing approach, and the flight navigator stated that he would apply a 4 km correction to position the aircraft for a second landing approach to where he thought the runway was located. By applying the 4 km correction, the flight navigator was providing the pilot in command with inaccurate data, and resulted in the aircraft being repositioned towards a point about 1.65 km (0.88 NM) northwest of the actual position of the threshold of runway 14. As the aircraft turned on to the final approach heading during the second landing approach, the flight navigator stated that the aircraft was high on the approach profile, based on his assumption of the location of the threshold of runway 14. The pilot in command increased the rate of descent of the aircraft to about 18 m/sec (3,543 fpm), and stated ÂIncreasedÂ. None of the other crewmembers commented on the high rate of descent, or drew the pilot in commandÂs attention to the fact that the approach was unstabilised at that point.  The flight engineer misinterpreted the pilot in commandÂs statement ÂIncreasedÂ to be an instruction for him to increase the engine thrust, and he advanced the thrust levers. It took about 2 seconds for the pilot in command to realise that engine thrust had been increased, and he reacted by calling ÂNo, I increased vertical speedÂ and reduced the engine thrust. The flight engineerÂs action in increasing engine thrust was a significant distraction to the pilot in command at that stage of the flight, and probably diverted his attention from the primary task of flying the aircraft to restoring the thrust to the proper setting. At about the same time, the aircraft descended through 162 m, which was the published MDH for a straight-in landing on the runway 14 NDB approach. Neither the pilot in command nor the copilot appeared to notice that the aircraft had descended through the MDH, and it is probable that both were distracted by the flight engineerÂs erroneous action.  The high rate of descent continued unchecked until slightly less than 2 seconds before impact. It is probable that the pilot in command and the copilot were each unaware of the high rate of descent, because neither was monitoring the flight instruments while they were looking ahead of the aircraft and trying to establish visual contact with the ground. The pilot in command applied back elevator to increase the aircraft pitch attitude in response to the co-pilot's urgent expression of concern that impact with terrain seemed almost certain. However, the pilot in command did not simultaneously increase the engine thrust, and it remained unchanged. The airplane impacted the ground. The right wingtip of the aircraft struck a partially constructed house and the aircraft broke up. SIGNIFICANT FACTORS: 1. The flight crew did not comply the published non-precision instrument approach and/or missed approach procedures at Baucau during flight in instrument meteorological conditions. 2. The flight crew conducted user-defined non-precision instrument approaches to runway 14 at Baucau during flight in instrument meteorological conditions. 3. The pilot in command permitted the aircraft to descend below the MDA(H) published on both the Jeppesen and CAD runway 14 instrument approach charts during flight in instrument meteorological conditions. 4. The flight crew did not recognise the increased likelihood and therefore risk of CFIT. 5. The flight crew did not recognise or treat that risk in a timely manner.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ATSB Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) Cameo K.

Four seconds after lifting off the runway, while climbing through a height of 12 m at a speed of 170 km/h, the left hand engine began vibrating. The power lever of the left engine was brought back to idle and later fully forward. The maximum altitude reached was 16 m. The airplane descended again and banked right. The airspeed decreased to below 120 km/h upon crossing the southern airport boundary. In a 60Â° right-hand bank the airplane impacted the ground and broke up. There was a fuel spill, but there was no fire. The aircraft crashed nose down into some trees, following the failure of the right hand engine shortly after takeoff. The weather was overcast with a light mixture of sleet and snow falling throughout the day.

Nearing Florencia, at an altitude of 5000 feet, the airplane's single engine suddenly quit. A forced landing was carried out on a bare, grassy hillside. All occupants survived the crash-landing and were found by FARC rebels who then shot and killed two of the crew members. The remaining three were taking hostage.

They had begun reducing speed to turbulence penetration ""prior to encountering a few pockets of light chop at about FL240.""  The captain gave a ""PA to the FA'S and passengers leaving FL180, asking that the cabin be prepared for landing early, due to possible chop during our approach.""  They encountered a very brief pocket of moderate chop.  The seatbelt sign was on, the cabin crew was in the process of securing the cabin for landing, and the purser had made the announcement for passengers to prepare for landing right after the captain's pre-landing announcement.  Several minutes after the event, the number one flight attendant, advised the captain that two of the flight attendants in the aft part of the airplane had been injured during the turbulence event.  A convective SIGMET was valid for Florida and coastal waters at the time of the turbulence encounter.  Radar images from the Miami Weather Surveillance Radar (WSR-88D) identified multiple storm cells in the area at the time of the turbulence encounter.  The radar data indicated that the core intensity of these cells was strong to intense (40 to 50 dBZ).  A radar image taken about the time of the turbulence encounter shows the airplanes path came about five nautical miles from the core of one cell and three nautical miles from the core of a second cell.  During this event, the airplane experienced a 2.04 g vertical acceleration load,  6 degree of left roll and a pitch change from -0.4 degrees to -2.1 degrees.

The aircraft in question was owned by Mr Yu. M Kabanov, deputy director of the Aviation Complex Myachkovo (AKM) and used by the Borki Air Club. On the day of the accident 23 skydivers boarded the Let 410. This was illegal since the maximum number of skydivers allowed on a Let 410 is 12 with lateral seating. In this case nearly all skydivers were sitting on the airplane's floor, one even occupied the toilet. As a result the airplane was overloaded by 618 kg and the centre of gravity was probably about 32% MAC where the maximum rear CofG was 28% MAC. At an altitude of about 3900 metres eleven skydivers prepared to exit the plane. When four of them had gotten out the CofG moved further aft (probably to about 35%) causing the Let to pitch up. The plane stalled, fell to the left and descended out of control. At an altitude of 2000 metres the aft fuselage section failed. Several skydivers were thrown out and the airplane crashed in a field.Sources: Soviet Transports  CONCLUSION on the crash of the aircraft L -410UVP of 01032 FLA RF / Ministry of Transport  Gazeta.ru  ITAR-TASS   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Air AlgÃ©rie flight 6289 originated in Tamanrasset and was bound for Algiers, with an intermediate stop at Ghardaia. Takeoff was commenced from runway 02 with the co-pilot acting as pilot-in-command. The aircraft rotated and at 15:14:52 the co-pilot ordered the gear to be raised. At that moment, at a height of 78 feet and a speed of 158 kts, the no. 1 engine suffered a turbine failure. The captain took over control of the airplane. Three seconds later the co-pilot asked if she should raise the gear, but the captain did not respond. The 737 lost speed and at 15:15:06 the speed had dropped to 134 kts. Height at that moment was 398 ft. The aircraft, named ""Monts du Daia"", stalled and crashed and broke up on rocky terrain about 1645 metres past the runway. PROBABLE CAUSES: The accident was caused by the loss of an engine during a critical phase of flight, the non-retraction of the landing gear after the engine failure, and the Captain, the PNF, taking over control of the airplane before having clearly identified the problem. The following factors probably contributed to the accident: - the perfunctory flight preparation, which meant that the crew were not equipped to face the situation that occurred at a critical moment of the flight; - the coincidence between the moment the failure occurred and the request to retract the landing gear; - the speed of the event that left the crew little time to recover the situation; - maintaining an inappropriate rate of climb, taking into account the failure of one engine; - the absence of any teamwork after the engine failure, which led to a failure to detect and correct parameters related to the conduct of the flight (speed, rate of climb, configuration, etc.); - the takeoff weight being close to the maximum with a high aerodrome altitude and high temperature; - the rocky environment around the aerodrome, unsuitable for an emergency landing.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CNE Report number: Report 7t-z030306 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   AFP  La Tribune d'Algerie   Location  Images: photo (c) Harro Ranter; Paris-Orly Airport (ORY); 24 September 1994; (CC:by-nc-nd) photo (c) Peter Frei; ZÃ¼rich-Kloten Airport (ZRH); 24 May 1992 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates04-Jan-2025 08:36 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The intention was then to fly from Rumbek Aerodrome to Lokichoggio in Kenya. During the VFR flight to Rumbek Aerodrome, the crew experienced a north-easterly wind with extremely turbulent conditions. Prior to landing at Rumbek Aerodrome, the crew calculated the approach and landing indicated air speeds (IAS) to be 85 kts and 75 kts respectively. The crew then joined the circuit accordingly for landing on runway 01. Approximately 4 nm away from landing, the co-pilot warned the pilot-in-command of a whirlwind in the area, close to the threshold of runway 01. The whirlwind appeared to have dissipated and the pilot-in-command continued with the landing with full flaps. At approximately 100 ft above ground level and 100 m before the threshold of runway 01, the IAS suddenly decreased to 70 kts. The pilot-in-command said that he immediately selected full power in order to arrest the rate of descent as wind shear in Southern Sudan and especially at Rumbek at this time of the year was a common factor. The aircraft nevertheless continued to descend and the left-hand propeller and left-hand main landing gear collided with a tree approximately 20 m before the threshold of runway 01. The tree was approximately 6 ft high and on an embankment. The aircraft then struck a drainage ditch before the threshold, causing the left-hand main landing gear to collapse. The airplane bounced and landed on the runway. The co-pilot immediately retracted the flaps and the aircraft continued down the runway on the right-hand main landing gear, but as its speed decayed, the left-hand propeller impacted with the runway surface. The aircraft veered to the left off the runway and entered a drainage ditch parallel to the runway. Both left and right-hand main landing gear were torn out of their attachment points and the aircraft eventually came to rest on its lower fuselage section.  The crew and passengers sustained no injuries and evacuated the aircraft safely through the emergency exits and rear main entry door. The aircraft was substantially damaged: both left and right-hand main landing gear were damaged; the left-hand outboard aileron was forced out of the outboard hinge point, and the lower fuselage frame and attachment stringers subsequently collapsed and were damaged.  The aircraft was temporary repaired on site by replacing two main landing gear, tailwheel, two engines, two props, one aileron and some skin repair. It was flown back to South Africa on 17 April 2003.Sources: CAA S.A.

When the captain rotated the airplane for lift-off the tail struck the runway and scraped for some 490 metres until the airplane became airborne. The tail strike occurred because the rotation speed was 33 knots less than the 163 knots required for the airplane weight. The rotation speed had been mistakenly calculated for an airplane weighing 100 tonnes less than the actual weight of 9V-SMT. A takeoff weight transcription error, which remained undetected, led to the miscalculation of the takeoff data, which in turn resulted in a low thrust setting and excessively slow takeoff reference speeds. The system defences did not ensure the errors were detected, and the airplane flight management system itself did not provide a final defence against mismatched information being programmed into it.

The landing gear was lowered.  When the wing flaps were positioned to 40 degrees, a landing gear aural warning commenced and continued until power was removed after landing.  The captain reported when the event initiated, he directed his vision outside the cockpit where it remained until after landing.  The co-pilot reported that he also directed his vision outside of the cockpit in the final 20 seconds of approach. Neither pilot made use of the standby instruments or used a flashlight to check instruments.  The captain commanded an emergency evacuation after he cleared the runway and stopped.  When interviewed, the flight attendants reported that during the emergency evacuation, they did not check conditions outside of their doors prior to opening them.  In addition, cabin emergency lighting was not turned on by the flight attendants, and the flight attendant at the tail cone station was unable to deploy her slide.  Examination of the airplane revealed the left power control distribution unit (PCDU) had failed.  The left DC bus was also lost and the ability to power the left DC bus from other sources was also lost.  The failure of the PCDU was not instantaneous and it tried to recycle several times.  Each time the PCDU recycled, it also reset the display of new data on the remaining DUs.  This caused an extended blank display followed by eventual reset of data.  The pre-programmed response to the loss of the left DC bus was the loss of two DUs, one on each side of the cockpit.

Neither pilot made use of the standby instruments or used a flashlight to check instruments.  The captain commanded an emergency evacuation after he cleared the runway and stopped.  When interviewed, the flight attendants reported that during the emergency evacuation, they did not check conditions outside of their doors prior to opening them.  In addition, cabin emergency lighting was not turned on by the flight attendants, and the flight attendant at the tail cone station was unable to deploy her slide.  Examination of the airplane revealed the left power control distribution unit (PCDU) had failed.  The left DC bus was also lost and the ability to power the left DC bus from other sources was also lost.  The failure of the PCDU was not instantaneous and it tried to recycle several times.  Each time the PCDU recycled, it also reset the display of new data on the remaining DUs.  This caused an extended blank display followed by eventual reset of data.  The pre-programmed response to the loss of the left DC bus was the loss of two DUs, one on each side of the cockpit. Probable Cause: A failure of the left power control distribution unit (PCDU).Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NYC03FA067 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB NYC03FA067 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  26 March 2003 N957AT AirTran Airways 0 New York-La Guardia Airport, NY (LGA/KLGA) min 28 June 2023 N955AT Delta Air Lines 0 Charlotte-Douglas International Airport, NC (CLT/KCLT) sub Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates25-Mar-2024 10:27 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

The pilot and five passengers were fatally injured. One passenger was seriously injured, and one person inside the building received minor injuries.  The accident flight departed the Bedford-Hanscom Field, MA (BED) at 07:00, and flew to New York-La Guardia Airport, NY (LGA) with only the pilot and pilot-rated passenger onboard. At LaGuardia, five additional passengers boarded the airplane, which subsequently departed on an IFR flight plan to Bedford. While en route, the crew amended the destination to Fitchburg. According to the surviving passenger, the intent was to drop off two passengers at Fitchburg, then continue on to the Martha's Vineyard Airport, MA (MVY), with the remaining passengers. While on approach to Fitchburg Airport, the airplane entered a left turn, which the surviving passenger described as ""almost completely upside down."" The airplane briefly levelled, then entered another left turn with a bank angle of the same severity. The airplane seemed to roll level, then entered a steep dive, until it impacted a building. The passenger reported that the engines were running normally throughout the entire flight, and the steep turns performed by the pilot did not concern her, as she had flown with him before and knew he ""liked to make sharp turns."" Examination of the airplane and engines revealed no pre-impact mechanical anomalies, and weather at the time of the accident included a broken cloud ceiling of 1,100 feet, with 3 miles visibility in mist.  Toxicology testing performed on the pilot revealed imipramine and carbamazepine in the pilot's urine and blood, and morphine in the pilot's urine. According to the pilot's medical and pharmacy records, he suffered from a severe neurological disorder, possibly a seizure disorder, which resulted in frequent, unpredictable episodes of debilitating pain. Additionally, approximately three months prior to the accident, the pilot was diagnosed with viral meningitis, and a severe skin infection with multiple abscesses on his extremities. The pilot had been prescribed imipramine, an antidepressant that has detrimental effects on driving skills and other cognitive functions. He had also been prescribed carbamazepine, typically used to control seizures or treat certain chronically painful conditions. Carbamazepine has measurable impairment of performance on a variety of psychomotor tests. Morphine, a prescription opiate painkiller, is also a metabolite of heroin and many prescription medications, such as codeine, used to control moderate pain. No indication was observed in the pilot's medical records that he was recently prescribed any opiates. Neither the pilot's medical condition, nor the medication he was routinely taking was reported on his application for an airman medical certificate. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The pilot's low altitude maneuver using an excessive bank angle, and his failure to maintain airspeed which resulted in an inadvertent stall and subsequent collision with a building. A factor was the pilot's impairment from prescription medications.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: IAD03FA043 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight took place under instrument flight rules. Using radar vectors, EC-HFA was cleared at 12:05 for an ILS approach to runway 14. The right hand seat on the flight deck was occupied by a PPL-rated passenger. During approach, the passenger read out various checklist points, which were each confirmed or commented upon by the pilot. At 12:06:39, at a distance of approximately 10 NM from ILS DME 14, the aircraft descended below 4000 ft QNH. At 12:07:07 the ATCO informed the pilot that he would be allowed to leave 4000 ft QNH only at a distance of 8 NM from ILS DME 14. The aircraft was already at 3600 ft, so he instructed EC-HFA to climb to 4000 ft QNH in order to be able to reach the ILS glide slope. The pilot answered: ""(...) I got the ILS catched, but I go to 4000 ft."" Subsequent to this radio conversation, the passenger mentioned the following to the pilot, with reference to the approach chart: ""Lo pone aquÃ­. Tenemos las montaÃ±as ahÃ­ Â Here it is. We have hills there."" EC-HFA then climbed back to an altitude of 4000 ft QNH, which it reached at approximately 8 NM. At about 7 NM, it began the descent and therefore found itself above the ILS glide slope. With the message ""All stations, ah... we have now RVR one thousand four hundred metres, thatÂs ah... showers of snow coming ah... overhead the field and the final, out."" at 12:07:41, the Zurich final ATCO informed all aircraft on the frequency that a snow shower was approaching the airport. A little later, the ATCO asked EC-HFA whether the aircraft was now stabilised on the ILS; the pilot confirmed this. At this time the aircraft was between 7 NM and 8 NM from the threshold of runway 14, approximately 200 ft above the glide slope. The ATCO also informed the pilot that the runway visual range (RVR) was now 1200 m. The pilot thanked him and asked the passenger to continue reading out the checklist. When the aircraft was approximately six miles from the threshold of runway 14, EC-HFA was asked to contact Zurich aerodrome control. This was confirmed by the pilot on the radio. He repeated the frequency several times to the passenger, who was busy entering the frequencies in this phase of the flight. At 12:09:10, the pilot contacted aerodrome control. There followed a further discussion between the two persons in the cockpit during which the passenger mentioned that it was now essential to fly precisely straight, because there was a 2500 m high tower to one side. It is highly probable that the passenger was referring to an obstacle which is shown on the approach chart with a tower symbol. This obstacle is approximately 9 NM from ILS DME 14, just to the east of the approach centreline and shows an altitude of 2566 ft AMSL. The passenger further suggested that for this reason the autopilot should be used. He finally quoted the value of 2200 ft and asked the pilot whether he did not want to set the flaps to ""full flaps"" position. At this time, EC-HFA received landing clearance for runway 14. This was immediately acknowledged by the pilot. The pilot then confirmed with the words: ""Full flaps... landing gear"" that everything was now ready for the landing. According to the radar recordings, throughout the final approach phase EC-HFA was always between 200 and 300 ft above the glide slope. At approximately 12:11:15, EC-HFA reached the decision height of 1602 ft. The passenger asked the pilot not to fly manually but to continue to let the autopilot fly EC-HFA, because there was no ground contact at this time. Shortly afterwards, the passenger mentioned that he could now see some of the ground. A few seconds later, the passenger said: ""Arrivando...Pista, ahÃ­!...La vÃ©s?...Muy bien, vamos muy bien. Dejalo, dejalo que baje - WeÂre arriving... The runway, there!... Do you see it?... Very good, weÂre very good. Let her go, let her go, she has to descend."" At 12:11:14 the aircraft touched down on the grass about 700 m before the runway threshold and skidded in a wide right turn in the direction of the threshold of runway 16. CAUSE: ""The accident is attributable to the fact that the pilot, with insufficient visual references, continued his approach below the minimum and the aircraft collided with the ground approximately 700 m before the threshold of runway 14.

As the airplane was being positioned by the ground guide, the underside of the left wing struck the top of a parked fleet service van.  Inspection of the left wing revealed that the outboard flap hinge assembly was displaced upward requiring replacement of the outboard rib, the outboard flap hanger assembly, and wrinkled upper wing skin near the wingtip.

The airplane was scheduled to depart at 1100, but was delayed due to the previous flight crews' report of a take off slat warning light indication problem. A maintenance check was completed and pushback for the next flight occurred at 1206. At 1224, while the crew was completing the pre-take off checks during the taxi, the captain reported another take off slat warning light indication problem. Maintenance requested that the captain return the airplane to the gate so a technician could reexamine the fault. At 1241, a maintenance technician assessed the problem and stated to the captain that ""were gonna [sic] have to mess up with your takeoff condition here and you know after we do this, you're not supposed to move anything."" The captain stated ""right."" The maintenance check procedures required that ""either or both"" engine throttles to be advanced to verify the operation of the warning horn. The operation of the system was verified and the slats were set in the takeoff configuration. During the entire maintenance check, the captain and first officer remained seated. At 1251, the first officer called for and received pushback clearance. The engines were started during pushback, and the captain stated that ""prior to the engine start sequence, I did not direct re-accomplishment of the before start checklist."" The captain said ""the pushback and initial stages of the engine start sequence appeared normal."" However, shortly after engine start and with the tug still attached, the airplane began to move forward under its own power. At that time, the captain noticed that the throttles were still advanced. The captain and first officer both reached to pull the engine throttles back to idle, but the airplane had moved forward enough to cause the tug and tow bar to jackknife to the left, striking the airplane and leaving a 4-foot long gash in the fuselage. The captain shut down the engines, secured the cockpit, and assessed the situation. Probable Cause: the flight crew's failure to maintain aircraft control, which resulted in engine start with the throttles advanced and the subsequent impact with the tug. Contributing factors include, the flight crew's improper procedures/directives and failure to re-accomplish the before start checklist, the captain's diverted attention, the manufacturer's inadequate MEL procedures, the manufacturer's insufficiently defined conditions/steps, and the tug.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DEN03FA070 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DEN03FA070 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates13-Oct-2022 14:56 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

A bang was heard from the rear of the fuselage. The aircraft commenced an uncommanded pitch-up to a near-vertical attitude, then stalled, nosed over, and began a spin to the left. The crew countered the spin but the aircraft continued to descend in a near-vertical dive. Through the application of full-up elevator and the manipulation of power settings, the pilots were able to bring the aircraft to a near-horizontal attitude. The crew extended the landing gear and issued a Mayday call, indicating that they were conducting a forced landing. The aircraft struck a knoll, tearing away the belly cargo pod and the landing gear. The aircraft bounced into the air and travelled approximately 180 metres, then contacted a barbed-wire fence and slid to a stop approximately 600 metres from the initial impact point. FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1. During flight, the horizontal stabilizer trim actuator worked free of the mounting structure, and as a result, the flight crew lost pitch control of the aircraft. 2. During replacement of the horizontal stabilizer trim actuator, the upper attachment bolts were inserted through the airframe structure but did not pass through the upper mounting lugs of the trim actuator. 3. The improperly installed bolts trapped the actuator mounting lug assemblies, suspending the weight of the actuator and giving the false impression that the bolts had been correctly installed. 4. Dual inspections, ground testing, and flight testing did not reveal the faulty attachment.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: TSB Report A03C0094 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: CBC  Images: photo (c) Elliott Greenman, via Werner Fischdick; Hagerstown-Wash.

The pilot decided to veer to the runway intersection. Unable to decelerate, the aircraft ran down a  5 meter embankment and went through a fence. It hit a barbecue stand, destroying it and slightly injuring the vendor. The aircraft suffered serious damage to its wings. Contributing factors a. Human Factor (1) Physiological - Did not contribute. (2) Psychological - Contributed By the presence, as a contributing factor, of the perceptive aspects, the decision making and the overconfidence of the crew; and as suspected aspects, the complacency and attention. b. Material Factor Did not contribute. c. Operational Factor (1) Adverse Weather Conditions - Contributed The rain that fell over Congonhas, moments before the accident, contributed to the occurrence of aquaplaning due to the high speed of the aircraft, culminating with the loss of control on the ground. (2) Poor Cabin Coordination - Contributed The lack of assertiveness of the co-pilot in not commanding the flight or taking commands when checking that the aircraft was outside the appropriate parameters for landing in the existing conditions. (3) Weak Judgment - Contributed For not performing a go around as a solution to the mistakes and failures committed during the approach, among which we can mention the excessively high descent gradient, the excessive speed, the non perception of hydroplaning and the cutting of the right engine. (4) Deficient Planning - Contributed Even informed that the runway was wet, the crew members did not outline any reaction in order to replan the procedures to be followed, adapting them to the new landing conditions, especially with regard to possible aquaplaning. (5) Little experience in the aircraft - contributed The pilot's limited experience in the aircraft influenced the mistakes made on the final approach and landing. (6) Poor Oversight - Contrived The company allowed a pilot without an employment relationship and without an adequate adaptation to the aircraft to exercise the function of pilot, which influenced the errors made during landingAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: CENIPA Report number: RF075/CENIPA/2005 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: Departamento de AviaÃ§Ã£o Civil (DAC)   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The 21 occupants aboard the airplane were killed. The accident airplane had undergone a detail six (D6) maintenance check between the night of January 6 and the morning of January 7, 2003. During this check the elevator cable tension was adjusted. In the process the elevator control system was incorrectly rigged, restricted the airplaneÂs elevator travel to 7Âº airplane nose down, or about one-half of the normal downward travel. This error was not detected prior to release to service. The airplane returned to service on the morning of January 7 and flew a total of nine flight legs before the accident flight. At 08:37 the aircraft was ready for taxi for a flight to Greenville-Spartanburg Airport, South Carolina, USA. At 08:46 the flight was cleared for takeoff from runway 18R. One minute later, immediately after the landing gear had been retracted, the nose pitched up to 20Â°. Both crew members reacted with surprise and the captain asked the first officer to help him. Both flight crew then attempted forcefully push the nose down. The nose continued to pitch up to 54Â° and the stall warning horn sounded. The aircraft's nose dropped and it rolled 127Â° to the left. The airplaneÂs roll attitude then stabilized at about 20Âº left wing down; the pitch attitude began to increase. About 08:47:24 the airplane rolled right through wings level, and the pitch attitude increased to about -5Âº. The nose dropped again and the airplane struck a US Airways maintenance hangar and came to rest about 1650 feet east of the runway 18R centerline and about 7600 feet beyond the runway 18R threshold.  It appeared that, aside from the limit nose down elevator travel, the aircraft had an excessive aft center of gravity due to substantially inaccurate weight and balance calculations. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The airplaneÂs loss of pitch control during takeoff.  The loss of pitch control resulted from the incorrect rigging of the elevator control system compounded by the airplaneÂs aft center of gravity, which was substantially aft of the certified aft limit. Contributing to the cause of the accident was: (1) Air MidwestÂs lack of oversight of the work being performed at the Huntington, West Virginia, maintenance station; (2) Air MidwestÂs maintenance procedures and documentation; (3) Air MidwestÂs weight and balance program at the time of the accident; (4) the Raytheon Aerospace quality assurance inspectorÂs failure to detect the incorrect rigging of the elevator system; (5) the FAAÂs average weight assumptions in its weight and balance program guidance at the time of the accident; and (6) the FAAÂs lack of oversight of Air MidwestÂs maintenance program and its weight and balance program.""METAR: 12:51 UTC / 07:51 local time: KCLT 081251Z 22006KT 10SM SCT140 BKN250 03/M07 A2975 RMK AO2 SLP075 T00331072=13:51 UTC / 08:51 local time: KCLT 081351Z 23007KT 10SM SCT140 BKN250 04/M06 A2976 RMK AO2 SLP079 T00391061=14:51 UTC / 09:51 local time: KCLT 081451Z 24008KT 210V290 10SM FEW140 BKN250 07/M04 A2977 RMK AO2 SLP083 T00671044 53008=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NTSB/AAR-04-01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   NTSB  ALPA Submission to the NTSB on Air Midwest Flight 5481 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  29 November 1997 C-FYSJ Ministic Air Island Lake, Manitoba Location  Images: photo (c) Lookout2; Charlotte-Douglas International Airport, NC (CLT); 08 January 2003; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) NTSB; Charlotte-Douglas International Airport, NC (CLT); January 2003 photo (c) Aviation Safety Network photo (c) Andrew Thon; Charlotte-Douglas International Airport, NC (CLT/KCLT); 2012 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

It departed Chiclayo at 08:17 and climbed to its assigned cruising altitude of FL190, which was reached approx. ten minutes after takeoff. The F-28 followed the V-3 airway, heading 075deg until 08:32. The crew then turned to the left heading 060deg, maintaining FL190 until 08:36. The flight then descended to FL130. After reaching that altitude five minutes later, the crew extended the speedbrakes in order to decelerate from 280 knots to 210 knots. Fifty seconds later, with the speedbrakes still extended, the crew turned to a heading of 135deg, aligning the plane with Chachapoyas' runway 13. The turn was accomplished in 45 seconds with a 30deg bank angle course change in 45 seconds. Shortly afterwards the Fellowship struck Cerro Coloque at an altitude of 10350 feet. Rescue workers found the wreckage two days after the crash. Until 1995 this F-28 was used as the Peruvian Presidential plane. PROBABLE ROOT CAUSES: 1.- PROBABLE MAIN CAUSE. The probable cause of the accident of the aircraft Fokker F-28, MK1000, OB-1396 of the company TANS-PERU, is the Impact Into Terrain without Loss of Control - CFIT (Controlled Flight Into Terrain) caused by complacency (overconfidence) and lack of effective communication between the technical crew, which leads to the total loss of situational awareness. 2.- PROBABLE SECONDARY CAUSES 2.1 Lack of compliance with Standard Operating Procedures. The CVR transcript shows that the Technical Crew was not alert, nor did they make any operational indication such as breafing or check list about the descent to the Chachapoyas airfield. 2.2 Lack of Crew Resource Management (CRM) There is no formal operational communication, in the CVR hearing there is a lot of informality and many comments out of place for a professional technical operation. 2.3 Loss of Situational Awareness. From the CVR hearing it can be extracted that the crew due to complacency (overconfidence) did not comply with the rules and procedures established for the operation of this route and airport. The alertness of the Technical Crew was not adequate for the operation phase. 3.- CONTRIBUTING FACTORS 3.1 Death of the Co-Pilot's father, 4 days before the date of the flight, could contribute as a stress, fatigue and depression agent, which could influence his professional performance. 3.2 The delay in the crew's payments and/or bonuses could have caused a stressful situation, which in the short, medium or long term contributes to fatigue, thus decreasing professional performance, which would affect flight safety. 3.3 Organizational system and operational environment. The constant changes of management personnel cause labor instability within the company, a situation that could be an agent of stress that affects human performance in any field. 4.- CONTRIBUTING HUMAN ERRORS The following Human Errors were observed in the analysis of the performance of this flight: 1) Poor judgment 2) Poor planning 3) Inadequate monitoring 4) Poor visual perspective 5) Poor visual perception 6) Operational complacency 7) Omitted procedures 8) Disorientation due to loss of situational awarenessMETAR: 13:00 UTC / 08:00 local time: SPPY 091300Z VRB02KT 9999 BKN015 SCT100 13/12 Q1028 PP000 TMN:12.5=14:00 UTC / 09:00 local time: SPPY 091400Z VRB03KT 9999 BKN018 SCT100 15/12 Q1028 PP000=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIAA Report number: CIAA-ACCID-001-2003 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) via W.

As the flight proceeded, it encountered intermittent light to occasionally moderate turbulence and the crew made repeated requests for a higher altitude through Air Traffic Control, but the requests were not approved. A little more than half way into the flight, the aircraft's track began to converge obliquely with a cold frontal system extending southwest through the Hawaiian Islands, and the aircraft encountered headwinds of more than 100 knots approximately 30 degrees right of the aircraft's track. Approximately 4 hours 17 minutes into the flight, the aircraft was operating in the tops of clouds with good visibility when a passenger and her attendant left their seats to use the lavatory located in the rear of the aircraft. During this time the aircraft encountered moderate turbulence for a period of ten seconds or less and the attendant sustained a fractured ankle.

After contacting Melilla tower at 11:48 the crew were told to start the descent on their own discretion and to expect a runway 33 approach. A company flight was second on approach and requested runway 15 for landing. The ATC asked the crew of PH-FZE ""would you admit to use one five or do you prefer to keep on runway three three?"" The question was repeated and it took some time for the crew of PH-FZE to answer: ""We can accept runway one five"" at 11:56. They were then cleared to runway 15 with wind 250Â° and 11 kt. Four minutes later the aircraft was cleared to land with wind 240Â° at 12 kt varying between 210Â° and 300Â°. Due to the runway change, the pilot in command had decided to land with flaps 35Â° and a reference speed of 95 KIAS. The aircraft made some S-turns to lose altitude because it was a little high in the approach path. The airplane overflew the displaced threshold of runway 15 at approximately 15 ft. During the landing, the pilot in command realised that he could not engage the propeller ground idle/reverse, he said ""I have no reverse"" and applied brakes in an attempt to stop the aircraft. Later on, the co-pilot also applied brakes. During the landing roll the aircraft did not decelerate as expected. The wheel number 3 became locked and was deflated by a flat spot. The aircraft started to veer to the left of the runway until wheel number 1 left the runway at around 150 m before the end of the 1347 m long runway. The Fokker continued down an embankment of around 15 m in height and came to rest against the airport perimeter fence. The fuselage broke near seat rows 6 to 8, and the floor was heavily deformed between those rows. After the aircraft came to a stop, the captain had been injured, and the crew members were frozen for a while, until the flight observer pilot who was in the jump seat stated that the occupants should leave the aircraft immediately and started carrying out the on-ground emergency checklist. He pulled both fire handles and tried to close both fuel levers, but he was unable to close those levers. Then the captain turned on the evacuation lights. In the mean time, after a while and in absence of commands from the cockpit, the rear flight attendant instructed the passengers, who were all seated in the rear part of the cabin, to leave the aircraft through door 2R, which opened without problem. CAUSES: ""It is considered that the accident probably happened because of a combination of three factors: 1. An unstable approach that resulted in a higher than normal touchdown speed. 2. The inability to select propeller reverse due to the probable tripping of the circuit breaker FLIGHT IDLE SOLENOID 1 & 2 before or at touchdown.  3. The cross connection of the wheel speed transducer wire harness of wheels 3 and 4, which, due to heavy braking, produced a flat spot in wheel 3 and reduced the braking capability of wheel 4.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIAIAC Report number: A-002/2003 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 12 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: ComisiÃ³n de InvestigaciÃ³n de Accidentes e Incidentes de AviaciÃ³n Civil Technical Report A-003/2003   Location  Images: photo (c) Reinhard Schmidt, via Werner Fischdick; Palma de Mallorca Airport (PMI); June 2000 photo (c) Pedro de la Cruz, via Werner Fischdick; Palma de Mallorca Airport (PMI); May 2001 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane executed a few instrument approaches at Mathis Field and proceeded to Ducote Airpark. While on final approach at 100-200 feet the engine surged. Subsequently, the airplane's wings began to bank left and right. The airplane entered a descent rate of 1,300 feet/minute (fpm) about 1,100 feet above the ground. This rate of descent was associated with a decrease in airspeed from 130 knots to 92 knots over a span of 30 seconds. The airplane's rate of descent leveled off at the 1,300-fpm rate for 45 seconds before increasing to a 2,000 fpm descent rate. The true airspeed fluctuated between a low of 88 knots to 102 knots during the last 45 seconds of flight.  The Caravan contacted power lines and trees, and impacted the ground. Two of the witnesses reported that they observed between 1/4 and 1-inch of ice on the various protected and unprotected surfaces of the aircraft. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The flight crew's failure to cycle the deice boots prior to conducting a simulated forced landing and their failure to maintain adequate airspeed during the maneuver, which resulted in an inadvertent stall and subsequent loss of control.

The captain, who was the pilot flying and sitting in the right-hand seat, completed a normal takeoff. The flight took off from runway 27, over a lake. About 400 feet above ground level, the captain began a climbing right turn en route. During the turn, she had difficulty seeing the artificial horizon and concentrated on the aircraft's bank angle. The first officer called that the aircraft was in a 2000-feet-per-minute descent and took control. The aircraft struck the frozen surface of the lake, bounced, and became airborne again. The first officer retained control, and the captain attempted to feather the damaged right propeller. The first officer, believing that both propellers had sustained damage, force-landed the aircraft on the lake surface. The aircraft sustained substantial damage. FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1. The captain chose to fly the aircraft from the right seat during a night departure when not current to operate the aircraft from the right seat. 2.

Despite numerous attempts, the copilot failed to contact Baucau ATS. The flight navigator then called Baucau Tower. A controller, who was present at Baucau aerodrome at the time, but not on operational duty, advised the flight crew that ATS was not available and that landing would be at the discretion of the flight crew. The pilot in command diverted the aircraft from the published inbound track to the Baucau NDB, and descended the aircraft below the published 10 NM MSA. He continued descending the aircraft through the commencement altitude for the published non-precision instrument approach for runway 14, and through the LSALT.  As the aircraft approached Baucau, the flight crew decided to conduct an overflight of the aerodrome before making a landing approach, and during the overflight, the flight crew realised that the runway was not where they expected it to be. It appeared that the crew did not use the Baucau NDB but used selected data from their instrument approach charts to formulate a user-defined non-precision approach using the onboard global positioning system (GPS). Adding to this, erroneous data on their Jeppesen charts meant the threshold of runway 14 was not where they thought it would be. Had the flight crew followed the non-precision runway 14 NDB approach procedure as published on either the CAD or Jeppesen charts, and not descended below the relevant MDA(H) until visual flight was assured, the position of the runway, as depicted on the Jeppesen charts would have been irrelevant.  During the overflight and the subsequent (first) landing approach, the flight crew realised that the runway was not where they expected it to be as it was depicted on the Jeppesen charts. The pilot in command discontinued the landing approach, and the flight navigator stated that he would apply a 4 km correction to position the aircraft for a second landing approach to where he thought the runway was located. By applying the 4 km correction, the flight navigator was providing the pilot in command with inaccurate data, and resulted in the aircraft being repositioned towards a point about 1.65 km (0.88 NM) northwest of the actual position of the threshold of runway 14. As the aircraft turned on to the final approach heading during the second landing approach, the flight navigator stated that the aircraft was high on the approach profile, based on his assumption of the location of the threshold of runway 14. The pilot in command increased the rate of descent of the aircraft to about 18 m/sec (3,543 fpm), and stated ÂIncreasedÂ. None of the other crewmembers commented on the high rate of descent, or drew the pilot in commandÂs attention to the fact that the approach was unstabilised at that point.  The flight engineer misinterpreted the pilot in commandÂs statement ÂIncreasedÂ to be an instruction for him to increase the engine thrust, and he advanced the thrust levers. It took about 2 seconds for the pilot in command to realise that engine thrust had been increased, and he reacted by calling ÂNo, I increased vertical speedÂ and reduced the engine thrust. The flight engineerÂs action in increasing engine thrust was a significant distraction to the pilot in command at that stage of the flight, and probably diverted his attention from the primary task of flying the aircraft to restoring the thrust to the proper setting. At about the same time, the aircraft descended through 162 m, which was the published MDH for a straight-in landing on the runway 14 NDB approach. Neither the pilot in command nor the copilot appeared to notice that the aircraft had descended through the MDH, and it is probable that both were distracted by the flight engineerÂs erroneous action.  The high rate of descent continued unchecked until slightly less than 2 seconds before impact. It is probable that the pilot in command and the copilot were each unaware of the high rate of descent, because neither was monitoring the flight instruments while they were looking ahead of the aircraft and trying to establish visual contact with the ground. The pilot in command applied back elevator to increase the aircraft pitch attitude in response to the co-pilot's urgent expression of concern that impact with terrain seemed almost certain. However, the pilot in command did not simultaneously increase the engine thrust, and it remained unchanged. The airplane impacted the ground. The right wingtip of the aircraft struck a partially constructed house and the aircraft broke up. SIGNIFICANT FACTORS: 1. The flight crew did not comply the published non-precision instrument approach and/or missed approach procedures at Baucau during flight in instrument meteorological conditions. 2. The flight crew conducted user-defined non-precision instrument approaches to runway 14 at Baucau during flight in instrument meteorological conditions. 3. The pilot in command permitted the aircraft to descend below the MDA(H) published on both the Jeppesen and CAD runway 14 instrument approach charts during flight in instrument meteorological conditions. 4. The flight crew did not recognise the increased likelihood and therefore risk of CFIT. 5. The flight crew did not recognise or treat that risk in a timely manner.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ATSB Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) Cameo K.

It is understood that the airplane left BogotÃ¡ (BOG) at 07:24 on a flight to Florencia (FLA) where it was to refuel prior to a mission. Nearing Florencia, at an altitude of 5000 feet, the airplane's single engine suddenly quit. A forced landing was carried out on a bare, grassy hillside. All occupants survived the crash-landing and were found by FARC rebels who then shot and killed two of the crew members. The remaining three were taking hostage. The three hostages were released in July 2008. An investigation by the US Southern Command showed that there was thermal damage to the turbine (engine) blades, causing an engine failure.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Aerocivil Report number: COL-03-06-GIA Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: Reports reveal little on plane crashes in Colombia (The Times-Picayune - January 13, 2004)   Location  Images: photo (c) Jorge Merino; Iquitos Airport (IQT); 2002 photo (c) Jorge Merino; Iquitos Airport (IQT); 2002 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

They had begun reducing speed to turbulence penetration ""prior to encountering a few pockets of light chop at about FL240.""  The captain gave a ""PA to the FA'S and passengers leaving FL180, asking that the cabin be prepared for landing early, due to possible chop during our approach.""  They encountered a very brief pocket of moderate chop.  The seatbelt sign was on, the cabin crew was in the process of securing the cabin for landing, and the purser had made the announcement for passengers to prepare for landing right after the captain's pre-landing announcement.  Several minutes after the event, the number one flight attendant, advised the captain that two of the flight attendants in the aft part of the airplane had been injured during the turbulence event.  A convective SIGMET was valid for Florida and coastal waters at the time of the turbulence encounter.  Radar images from the Miami Weather Surveillance Radar (WSR-88D) identified multiple storm cells in the area at the time of the turbulence encounter.  The radar data indicated that the core intensity of these cells was strong to intense (40 to 50 dBZ).  A radar image taken about the time of the turbulence encounter shows the airplanes path came about five nautical miles from the core of one cell and three nautical miles from the core of a second cell.  During this event, the airplane experienced a 2.04 g vertical acceleration load,  6 degree of left roll and a pitch change from -0.4 degrees to -2.1 degrees.   Probable Cause: The flight crew's inadvertent encounter with turbulence while attempting to maneuver through an area of convective activity during descent.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: MIA03LA067 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB MIA03LA067 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  11 March 2005 N790AN American Airlines 0 Buenos Aires/Ezeiza-Ministro Pistarini Airport, BA (EZE/SAEZ) unk 28 February 2024 N790AN American Airlines 0 E of Boston, MA min Windscreen cracks or failure Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates25-Mar-2024 10:28 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

The aircraft in question was owned by Mr Yu. M Kabanov, deputy director of the Aviation Complex Myachkovo (AKM) and used by the Borki Air Club. On the day of the accident 23 skydivers boarded the Let 410. This was illegal since the maximum number of skydivers allowed on a Let 410 is 12 with lateral seating. In this case nearly all skydivers were sitting on the airplane's floor, one even occupied the toilet. As a result the airplane was overloaded by 618 kg and the centre of gravity was probably about 32% MAC where the maximum rear CofG was 28% MAC. At an altitude of about 3900 metres eleven skydivers prepared to exit the plane. When four of them had gotten out the CofG moved further aft (probably to about 35%) causing the Let to pitch up. The plane stalled, fell to the left and descended out of control. At an altitude of 2000 metres the aft fuselage section failed. Several skydivers were thrown out and the airplane crashed in a field.Sources: Soviet Transports  CONCLUSION on the crash of the aircraft L -410UVP of 01032 FLA RF / Ministry of Transport  Gazeta.ru  ITAR-TASS   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Air AlgÃ©rie flight 6289 originated in Tamanrasset and was bound for Algiers, with an intermediate stop at Ghardaia. Takeoff was commenced from runway 02 with the co-pilot acting as pilot-in-command. The aircraft rotated and at 15:14:52 the co-pilot ordered the gear to be raised. At that moment, at a height of 78 feet and a speed of 158 kts, the no. 1 engine suffered a turbine failure. The captain took over control of the airplane. Three seconds later the co-pilot asked if she should raise the gear, but the captain did not respond. The 737 lost speed and at 15:15:06 the speed had dropped to 134 kts. Height at that moment was 398 ft. The aircraft, named ""Monts du Daia"", stalled and crashed and broke up on rocky terrain about 1645 metres past the runway. PROBABLE CAUSES: The accident was caused by the loss of an engine during a critical phase of flight, the non-retraction of the landing gear after the engine failure, and the Captain, the PNF, taking over control of the airplane before having clearly identified the problem. The following factors probably contributed to the accident: - the perfunctory flight preparation, which meant that the crew were not equipped to face the situation that occurred at a critical moment of the flight; - the coincidence between the moment the failure occurred and the request to retract the landing gear; - the speed of the event that left the crew little time to recover the situation; - maintaining an inappropriate rate of climb, taking into account the failure of one engine; - the absence of any teamwork after the engine failure, which led to a failure to detect and correct parameters related to the conduct of the flight (speed, rate of climb, configuration, etc.); - the takeoff weight being close to the maximum with a high aerodrome altitude and high temperature; - the rocky environment around the aerodrome, unsuitable for an emergency landing.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CNE Report number: Report 7t-z030306 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   AFP  La Tribune d'Algerie   Location  Images: photo (c) Harro Ranter; Paris-Orly Airport (ORY); 24 September 1994; (CC:by-nc-nd) photo (c) Peter Frei; ZÃ¼rich-Kloten Airport (ZRH); 24 May 1992 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates04-Jan-2025 08:36 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The intention was then to fly from Rumbek Aerodrome to Lokichoggio in Kenya. During the VFR flight to Rumbek Aerodrome, the crew experienced a north-easterly wind with extremely turbulent conditions. Prior to landing at Rumbek Aerodrome, the crew calculated the approach and landing indicated air speeds (IAS) to be 85 kts and 75 kts respectively. The crew then joined the circuit accordingly for landing on runway 01. Approximately 4 nm away from landing, the co-pilot warned the pilot-in-command of a whirlwind in the area, close to the threshold of runway 01. The whirlwind appeared to have dissipated and the pilot-in-command continued with the landing with full flaps. At approximately 100 ft above ground level and 100 m before the threshold of runway 01, the IAS suddenly decreased to 70 kts. The pilot-in-command said that he immediately selected full power in order to arrest the rate of descent as wind shear in Southern Sudan and especially at Rumbek at this time of the year was a common factor. The aircraft nevertheless continued to descend and the left-hand propeller and left-hand main landing gear collided with a tree approximately 20 m before the threshold of runway 01. The tree was approximately 6 ft high and on an embankment. The aircraft then struck a drainage ditch before the threshold, causing the left-hand main landing gear to collapse. The airplane bounced and landed on the runway. The co-pilot immediately retracted the flaps and the aircraft continued down the runway on the right-hand main landing gear, but as its speed decayed, the left-hand propeller impacted with the runway surface. The aircraft veered to the left off the runway and entered a drainage ditch parallel to the runway. Both left and right-hand main landing gear were torn out of their attachment points and the aircraft eventually came to rest on its lower fuselage section.  The crew and passengers sustained no injuries and evacuated the aircraft safely through the emergency exits and rear main entry door. The aircraft was substantially damaged: both left and right-hand main landing gear were damaged; the left-hand outboard aileron was forced out of the outboard hinge point, and the lower fuselage frame and attachment stringers subsequently collapsed and were damaged.  The aircraft was temporary repaired on site by replacing two main landing gear, tailwheel, two engines, two props, one aileron and some skin repair. It was flown back to South Africa on 17 April 2003.Sources: CAA S.A.

When the captain rotated the airplane for lift-off the tail struck the runway and scraped for some 490 metres until the airplane became airborne. The tail strike occurred because the rotation speed was 33 knots less than the 163 knots required for the airplane weight. The rotation speed had been mistakenly calculated for an airplane weighing 100 tonnes less than the actual weight of 9V-SMT. A takeoff weight transcription error, which remained undetected, led to the miscalculation of the takeoff data, which in turn resulted in a low thrust setting and excessively slow takeoff reference speeds. The system defences did not ensure the errors were detected, and the airplane flight management system itself did not provide a final defence against mismatched information being programmed into it. During the takeoff the airplane moved close to the runway edge and the pilots did not respond correctly to a stall warning.

It is likely that this contributed to the inadequate judgment of the landing conditions. e) Other - contributed In spite of the initiative to perform 360 degrees circle, to lose height, the pilot ended up positioned high and fast for the landing, which caused the touch down at 450 meters from the threshold of runway 35 and the exiting of the runway. 1.3.2 Concerning ATS  Did not contribute. 2 Material Factor 2.1 Concerning the aircraft Did not contribute. 2.2 Concerning equipment and technology systems for ATS Did not contribute.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CENIPA Report number: RF A-104/CENIPA/2011 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 8 years and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Departamento de AviaÃ§Ã£o Civil (DAC)   Location  Images: photo (c) aeroprints.com; Rantoul, KS; 30 April 2013; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The landing gear was lowered.  When the wing flaps were positioned to 40 degrees, a landing gear aural warning commenced and continued until power was removed after landing.

The pilot and five passengers were fatally injured. One passenger was seriously injured, and one person inside the building received minor injuries.  The accident flight departed the Bedford-Hanscom Field, MA (BED) at 07:00, and flew to New York-La Guardia Airport, NY (LGA) with only the pilot and pilot-rated passenger onboard. At LaGuardia, five additional passengers boarded the airplane, which subsequently departed on an IFR flight plan to Bedford. While en route, the crew amended the destination to Fitchburg. According to the surviving passenger, the intent was to drop off two passengers at Fitchburg, then continue on to the Martha's Vineyard Airport, MA (MVY), with the remaining passengers. While on approach to Fitchburg Airport, the airplane entered a left turn, which the surviving passenger described as ""almost completely upside down."" The airplane briefly levelled, then entered another left turn with a bank angle of the same severity. The airplane seemed to roll level, then entered a steep dive, until it impacted a building. The passenger reported that the engines were running normally throughout the entire flight, and the steep turns performed by the pilot did not concern her, as she had flown with him before and knew he ""liked to make sharp turns."" Examination of the airplane and engines revealed no pre-impact mechanical anomalies, and weather at the time of the accident included a broken cloud ceiling of 1,100 feet, with 3 miles visibility in mist.  Toxicology testing performed on the pilot revealed imipramine and carbamazepine in the pilot's urine and blood, and morphine in the pilot's urine. According to the pilot's medical and pharmacy records, he suffered from a severe neurological disorder, possibly a seizure disorder, which resulted in frequent, unpredictable episodes of debilitating pain. Additionally, approximately three months prior to the accident, the pilot was diagnosed with viral meningitis, and a severe skin infection with multiple abscesses on his extremities. The pilot had been prescribed imipramine, an antidepressant that has detrimental effects on driving skills and other cognitive functions. He had also been prescribed carbamazepine, typically used to control seizures or treat certain chronically painful conditions. Carbamazepine has measurable impairment of performance on a variety of psychomotor tests. Morphine, a prescription opiate painkiller, is also a metabolite of heroin and many prescription medications, such as codeine, used to control moderate pain. No indication was observed in the pilot's medical records that he was recently prescribed any opiates. Neither the pilot's medical condition, nor the medication he was routinely taking was reported on his application for an airman medical certificate. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The pilot's low altitude maneuver using an excessive bank angle, and his failure to maintain airspeed which resulted in an inadvertent stall and subsequent collision with a building. A factor was the pilot's impairment from prescription medications.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: IAD03FA043 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight took place under instrument flight rules. Using radar vectors, EC-HFA was cleared at 12:05 for an ILS approach to runway 14. The right hand seat on the flight deck was occupied by a PPL-rated passenger. During approach, the passenger read out various checklist points, which were each confirmed or commented upon by the pilot. At 12:06:39, at a distance of approximately 10 NM from ILS DME 14, the aircraft descended below 4000 ft QNH. At 12:07:07 the ATCO informed the pilot that he would be allowed to leave 4000 ft QNH only at a distance of 8 NM from ILS DME 14. The aircraft was already at 3600 ft, so he instructed EC-HFA to climb to 4000 ft QNH in order to be able to reach the ILS glide slope. The pilot answered: ""(...) I got the ILS catched, but I go to 4000 ft."" Subsequent to this radio conversation, the passenger mentioned the following to the pilot, with reference to the approach chart: ""Lo pone aquÃ­. Tenemos las montaÃ±as ahÃ­ Â Here it is. We have hills there."" EC-HFA then climbed back to an altitude of 4000 ft QNH, which it reached at approximately 8 NM. At about 7 NM, it began the descent and therefore found itself above the ILS glide slope. With the message ""All stations, ah... we have now RVR one thousand four hundred metres, thatÂs ah... showers of snow coming ah... overhead the field and the final, out."" at 12:07:41, the Zurich final ATCO informed all aircraft on the frequency that a snow shower was approaching the airport. A little later, the ATCO asked EC-HFA whether the aircraft was now stabilised on the ILS; the pilot confirmed this. At this time the aircraft was between 7 NM and 8 NM from the threshold of runway 14, approximately 200 ft above the glide slope. The ATCO also informed the pilot that the runway visual range (RVR) was now 1200 m. The pilot thanked him and asked the passenger to continue reading out the checklist. When the aircraft was approximately six miles from the threshold of runway 14, EC-HFA was asked to contact Zurich aerodrome control. This was confirmed by the pilot on the radio. He repeated the frequency several times to the passenger, who was busy entering the frequencies in this phase of the flight. At 12:09:10, the pilot contacted aerodrome control. There followed a further discussion between the two persons in the cockpit during which the passenger mentioned that it was now essential to fly precisely straight, because there was a 2500 m high tower to one side. It is highly probable that the passenger was referring to an obstacle which is shown on the approach chart with a tower symbol. This obstacle is approximately 9 NM from ILS DME 14, just to the east of the approach centreline and shows an altitude of 2566 ft AMSL. The passenger further suggested that for this reason the autopilot should be used. He finally quoted the value of 2200 ft and asked the pilot whether he did not want to set the flaps to ""full flaps"" position. At this time, EC-HFA received landing clearance for runway 14. This was immediately acknowledged by the pilot. The pilot then confirmed with the words: ""Full flaps... landing gear"" that everything was now ready for the landing. According to the radar recordings, throughout the final approach phase EC-HFA was always between 200 and 300 ft above the glide slope. At approximately 12:11:15, EC-HFA reached the decision height of 1602 ft. The passenger asked the pilot not to fly manually but to continue to let the autopilot fly EC-HFA, because there was no ground contact at this time. Shortly afterwards, the passenger mentioned that he could now see some of the ground. A few seconds later, the passenger said: ""Arrivando...Pista, ahÃ­!...La vÃ©s?...Muy bien, vamos muy bien. Dejalo, dejalo que baje - WeÂre arriving... The runway, there!... Do you see it?... Very good, weÂre very good. Let her go, let her go, she has to descend."" At 12:11:14 the aircraft touched down on the grass about 700 m before the runway threshold and skidded in a wide right turn in the direction of the threshold of runway 16. CAUSE: ""The accident is attributable to the fact that the pilot, with insufficient visual references, continued his approach below the minimum and the aircraft collided with the ground approximately 700 m before the threshold of runway 14. The following factors contributed to the accident: - unsatisfactory flying qualification on the aircraft type involved in the accident. - distraction by the passenger during the entire approach and at the decision height.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BFU Switz.

The airplane was being marshaled into a parking spot by a single ground guide utilizing hand signals.  No other airplanes were parked nearby, and wing-walkers were not utilized.  As the airplane was being positioned by the ground guide, the underside of the left wing struck the top of a parked fleet service van.  Inspection of the left wing revealed that the outboard flap hinge assembly was displaced upward requiring replacement of the outboard rib, the outboard flap hanger assembly, and wrinkled upper wing skin near the wingtip.

The airplane was scheduled to depart at 1100, but was delayed due to the previous flight crews' report of a take off slat warning light indication problem. A maintenance check was completed and pushback for the next flight occurred at 1206. At 1224, while the crew was completing the pre-take off checks during the taxi, the captain reported another take off slat warning light indication problem. Maintenance requested that the captain return the airplane to the gate so a technician could reexamine the fault. At 1241, a maintenance technician assessed the problem and stated to the captain that ""were gonna [sic] have to mess up with your takeoff condition here and you know after we do this, you're not supposed to move anything."" The captain stated ""right."" The maintenance check procedures required that ""either or both"" engine throttles to be advanced to verify the operation of the warning horn. The operation of the system was verified and the slats were set in the takeoff configuration. During the entire maintenance check, the captain and first officer remained seated. At 1251, the first officer called for and received pushback clearance. The engines were started during pushback, and the captain stated that ""prior to the engine start sequence, I did not direct re-accomplishment of the before start checklist."" The captain said ""the pushback and initial stages of the engine start sequence appeared normal."" However, shortly after engine start and with the tug still attached, the airplane began to move forward under its own power. At that time, the captain noticed that the throttles were still advanced. The captain and first officer both reached to pull the engine throttles back to idle, but the airplane had moved forward enough to cause the tug and tow bar to jackknife to the left, striking the airplane and leaving a 4-foot long gash in the fuselage. The captain shut down the engines, secured the cockpit, and assessed the situation. Probable Cause: the flight crew's failure to maintain aircraft control, which resulted in engine start with the throttles advanced and the subsequent impact with the tug. Contributing factors include, the flight crew's improper procedures/directives and failure to re-accomplish the before start checklist, the captain's diverted attention, the manufacturer's inadequate MEL procedures, the manufacturer's insufficiently defined conditions/steps, and the tug.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DEN03FA070 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DEN03FA070 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates13-Oct-2022 14:56 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

A bang was heard from the rear of the fuselage. The aircraft commenced an uncommanded pitch-up to a near-vertical attitude, then stalled, nosed over, and began a spin to the left. The crew countered the spin but the aircraft continued to descend in a near-vertical dive. Through the application of full-up elevator and the manipulation of power settings, the pilots were able to bring the aircraft to a near-horizontal attitude. The crew extended the landing gear and issued a Mayday call, indicating that they were conducting a forced landing. The aircraft struck a knoll, tearing away the belly cargo pod and the landing gear. The aircraft bounced into the air and travelled approximately 180 metres, then contacted a barbed-wire fence and slid to a stop approximately 600 metres from the initial impact point. FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1. During flight, the horizontal stabilizer trim actuator worked free of the mounting structure, and as a result, the flight crew lost pitch control of the aircraft. 2. During replacement of the horizontal stabilizer trim actuator, the upper attachment bolts were inserted through the airframe structure but did not pass through the upper mounting lugs of the trim actuator. 3. The improperly installed bolts trapped the actuator mounting lug assemblies, suspending the weight of the actuator and giving the false impression that the bolts had been correctly installed. 4. Dual inspections, ground testing, and flight testing did not reveal the faulty attachment.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: TSB Report A03C0094 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: CBC  Images: photo (c) Elliott Greenman, via Werner Fischdick; Hagerstown-Wash.

The pilot decided to veer to the runway intersection. Unable to decelerate, the aircraft ran down a  5 meter embankment and went through a fence. It hit a barbecue stand, destroying it and slightly injuring the vendor. The aircraft suffered serious damage to its wings. Contributing factors a. Human Factor (1) Physiological - Did not contribute. (2) Psychological - Contributed By the presence, as a contributing factor, of the perceptive aspects, the decision making and the overconfidence of the crew; and as suspected aspects, the complacency and attention. b. Material Factor Did not contribute. c. Operational Factor (1) Adverse Weather Conditions - Contributed The rain that fell over Congonhas, moments before the accident, contributed to the occurrence of aquaplaning due to the high speed of the aircraft, culminating with the loss of control on the ground. (2) Poor Cabin Coordination - Contributed The lack of assertiveness of the co-pilot in not commanding the flight or taking commands when checking that the aircraft was outside the appropriate parameters for landing in the existing conditions. (3) Weak Judgment - Contributed For not performing a go around as a solution to the mistakes and failures committed during the approach, among which we can mention the excessively high descent gradient, the excessive speed, the non perception of hydroplaning and the cutting of the right engine. (4) Deficient Planning - Contributed Even informed that the runway was wet, the crew members did not outline any reaction in order to replan the procedures to be followed, adapting them to the new landing conditions, especially with regard to possible aquaplaning. (5) Little experience in the aircraft - contributed The pilot's limited experience in the aircraft influenced the mistakes made on the final approach and landing. (6) Poor Oversight - Contrived The company allowed a pilot without an employment relationship and without an adequate adaptation to the aircraft to exercise the function of pilot, which influenced the errors made during landingAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: CENIPA Report number: RF075/CENIPA/2005 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: Departamento de AviaÃ§Ã£o Civil (DAC)   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The 21 occupants aboard the airplane were killed. The accident airplane had undergone a detail six (D6) maintenance check between the night of January 6 and the morning of January 7, 2003. During this check the elevator cable tension was adjusted. In the process the elevator control system was incorrectly rigged, restricted the airplaneÂs elevator travel to 7Âº airplane nose down, or about one-half of the normal downward travel. This error was not detected prior to release to service. The airplane returned to service on the morning of January 7 and flew a total of nine flight legs before the accident flight. At 08:37 the aircraft was ready for taxi for a flight to Greenville-Spartanburg Airport, South Carolina, USA. At 08:46 the flight was cleared for takeoff from runway 18R. One minute later, immediately after the landing gear had been retracted, the nose pitched up to 20Â°. Both crew members reacted with surprise and the captain asked the first officer to help him. Both flight crew then attempted forcefully push the nose down. The nose continued to pitch up to 54Â° and the stall warning horn sounded. The aircraft's nose dropped and it rolled 127Â° to the left. The airplaneÂs roll attitude then stabilized at about 20Âº left wing down; the pitch attitude began to increase. About 08:47:24 the airplane rolled right through wings level, and the pitch attitude increased to about -5Âº. The nose dropped again and the airplane struck a US Airways maintenance hangar and came to rest about 1650 feet east of the runway 18R centerline and about 7600 feet beyond the runway 18R threshold.  It appeared that, aside from the limit nose down elevator travel, the aircraft had an excessive aft center of gravity due to substantially inaccurate weight and balance calculations. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The airplaneÂs loss of pitch control during takeoff.  The loss of pitch control resulted from the incorrect rigging of the elevator control system compounded by the airplaneÂs aft center of gravity, which was substantially aft of the certified aft limit. Contributing to the cause of the accident was: (1) Air MidwestÂs lack of oversight of the work being performed at the Huntington, West Virginia, maintenance station; (2) Air MidwestÂs maintenance procedures and documentation; (3) Air MidwestÂs weight and balance program at the time of the accident; (4) the Raytheon Aerospace quality assurance inspectorÂs failure to detect the incorrect rigging of the elevator system; (5) the FAAÂs average weight assumptions in its weight and balance program guidance at the time of the accident; and (6) the FAAÂs lack of oversight of Air MidwestÂs maintenance program and its weight and balance program.""METAR: 12:51 UTC / 07:51 local time: KCLT 081251Z 22006KT 10SM SCT140 BKN250 03/M07 A2975 RMK AO2 SLP075 T00331072=13:51 UTC / 08:51 local time: KCLT 081351Z 23007KT 10SM SCT140 BKN250 04/M06 A2976 RMK AO2 SLP079 T00391061=14:51 UTC / 09:51 local time: KCLT 081451Z 24008KT 210V290 10SM FEW140 BKN250 07/M04 A2977 RMK AO2 SLP083 T00671044 53008=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NTSB/AAR-04-01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   NTSB  ALPA Submission to the NTSB on Air Midwest Flight 5481 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  29 November 1997 C-FYSJ Ministic Air Island Lake, Manitoba Location  Images: photo (c) Lookout2; Charlotte-Douglas International Airport, NC (CLT); 08 January 2003; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) NTSB; Charlotte-Douglas International Airport, NC (CLT); January 2003 photo (c) Aviation Safety Network photo (c) Andrew Thon; Charlotte-Douglas International Airport, NC (CLT/KCLT); 2012 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

It departed Chiclayo at 08:17 and climbed to its assigned cruising altitude of FL190, which was reached approx. ten minutes after takeoff. The F-28 followed the V-3 airway, heading 075deg until 08:32. The crew then turned to the left heading 060deg, maintaining FL190 until 08:36. The flight then descended to FL130. After reaching that altitude five minutes later, the crew extended the speedbrakes in order to decelerate from 280 knots to 210 knots. Fifty seconds later, with the speedbrakes still extended, the crew turned to a heading of 135deg, aligning the plane with Chachapoyas' runway 13. The turn was accomplished in 45 seconds with a 30deg bank angle course change in 45 seconds. Shortly afterwards the Fellowship struck Cerro Coloque at an altitude of 10350 feet. Rescue workers found the wreckage two days after the crash. Until 1995 this F-28 was used as the Peruvian Presidential plane. PROBABLE ROOT CAUSES: 1.- PROBABLE MAIN CAUSE. The probable cause of the accident of the aircraft Fokker F-28, MK1000, OB-1396 of the company TANS-PERU, is the Impact Into Terrain without Loss of Control - CFIT (Controlled Flight Into Terrain) caused by complacency (overconfidence) and lack of effective communication between the technical crew, which leads to the total loss of situational awareness. 2.- PROBABLE SECONDARY CAUSES 2.1 Lack of compliance with Standard Operating Procedures. The CVR transcript shows that the Technical Crew was not alert, nor did they make any operational indication such as breafing or check list about the descent to the Chachapoyas airfield. 2.2 Lack of Crew Resource Management (CRM) There is no formal operational communication, in the CVR hearing there is a lot of informality and many comments out of place for a professional technical operation. 2.3 Loss of Situational Awareness. From the CVR hearing it can be extracted that the crew due to complacency (overconfidence) did not comply with the rules and procedures established for the operation of this route and airport. The alertness of the Technical Crew was not adequate for the operation phase. 3.- CONTRIBUTING FACTORS 3.1 Death of the Co-Pilot's father, 4 days before the date of the flight, could contribute as a stress, fatigue and depression agent, which could influence his professional performance. 3.2 The delay in the crew's payments and/or bonuses could have caused a stressful situation, which in the short, medium or long term contributes to fatigue, thus decreasing professional performance, which would affect flight safety. 3.3 Organizational system and operational environment. The constant changes of management personnel cause labor instability within the company, a situation that could be an agent of stress that affects human performance in any field. 4.- CONTRIBUTING HUMAN ERRORS The following Human Errors were observed in the analysis of the performance of this flight: 1) Poor judgment 2) Poor planning 3) Inadequate monitoring 4) Poor visual perspective 5) Poor visual perception 6) Operational complacency 7) Omitted procedures 8) Disorientation due to loss of situational awarenessMETAR: 13:00 UTC / 08:00 local time: SPPY 091300Z VRB02KT 9999 BKN015 SCT100 13/12 Q1028 PP000 TMN:12.5=14:00 UTC / 09:00 local time: SPPY 091400Z VRB03KT 9999 BKN018 SCT100 15/12 Q1028 PP000=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIAA Report number: CIAA-ACCID-001-2003 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) via W.

As the flight proceeded, it encountered intermittent light to occasionally moderate turbulence and the crew made repeated requests for a higher altitude through Air Traffic Control, but the requests were not approved. A little more than half way into the flight, the aircraft's track began to converge obliquely with a cold frontal system extending southwest through the Hawaiian Islands, and the aircraft encountered headwinds of more than 100 knots approximately 30 degrees right of the aircraft's track. Approximately 4 hours 17 minutes into the flight, the aircraft was operating in the tops of clouds with good visibility when a passenger and her attendant left their seats to use the lavatory located in the rear of the aircraft. During this time the aircraft encountered moderate turbulence for a period of ten seconds or less and the attendant sustained a fractured ankle. Immediately following the event the crew requested and received approval for a climb to FL 370.

The Fokker took off from MÃ¡laga at 11:32 for a cross-Mediterranean flight to the Spanish enclave of Melilla. The aircraft climbed to its assigned cruising altitude of FL130. After contacting Melilla tower at 11:48 the crew were told to start the descent on their own discretion and to expect a runway 33 approach. A company flight was second on approach and requested runway 15 for landing. The ATC asked the crew of PH-FZE ""would you admit to use one five or do you prefer to keep on runway three three?"" The question was repeated and it took some time for the crew of PH-FZE to answer: ""We can accept runway one five"" at 11:56. They were then cleared to runway 15 with wind 250Â° and 11 kt. Four minutes later the aircraft was cleared to land with wind 240Â° at 12 kt varying between 210Â° and 300Â°. Due to the runway change, the pilot in command had decided to land with flaps 35Â° and a reference speed of 95 KIAS. The aircraft made some S-turns to lose altitude because it was a little high in the approach path. The airplane overflew the displaced threshold of runway 15 at approximately 15 ft. During the landing, the pilot in command realised that he could not engage the propeller ground idle/reverse, he said ""I have no reverse"" and applied brakes in an attempt to stop the aircraft. Later on, the co-pilot also applied brakes. During the landing roll the aircraft did not decelerate as expected. The wheel number 3 became locked and was deflated by a flat spot. The aircraft started to veer to the left of the runway until wheel number 1 left the runway at around 150 m before the end of the 1347 m long runway. The Fokker continued down an embankment of around 15 m in height and came to rest against the airport perimeter fence. The fuselage broke near seat rows 6 to 8, and the floor was heavily deformed between those rows. After the aircraft came to a stop, the captain had been injured, and the crew members were frozen for a while, until the flight observer pilot who was in the jump seat stated that the occupants should leave the aircraft immediately and started carrying out the on-ground emergency checklist. He pulled both fire handles and tried to close both fuel levers, but he was unable to close those levers. Then the captain turned on the evacuation lights. In the mean time, after a while and in absence of commands from the cockpit, the rear flight attendant instructed the passengers, who were all seated in the rear part of the cabin, to leave the aircraft through door 2R, which opened without problem. CAUSES: ""It is considered that the accident probably happened because of a combination of three factors: 1. An unstable approach that resulted in a higher than normal touchdown speed. 2. The inability to select propeller reverse due to the probable tripping of the circuit breaker FLIGHT IDLE SOLENOID 1 & 2 before or at touchdown.  3. The cross connection of the wheel speed transducer wire harness of wheels 3 and 4, which, due to heavy braking, produced a flat spot in wheel 3 and reduced the braking capability of wheel 4.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIAIAC Report number: A-002/2003 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 12 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: ComisiÃ³n de InvestigaciÃ³n de Accidentes e Incidentes de AviaciÃ³n Civil Technical Report A-003/2003   Location  Images: photo (c) Reinhard Schmidt, via Werner Fischdick; Palma de Mallorca Airport (PMI); June 2000 photo (c) Pedro de la Cruz, via Werner Fischdick; Palma de Mallorca Airport (PMI); May 2001 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane executed a few instrument approaches at Mathis Field and proceeded to Ducote Airpark. While on final approach at 100-200 feet the engine surged. Subsequently, the airplane's wings began to bank left and right. The airplane entered a descent rate of 1,300 feet/minute (fpm) about 1,100 feet above the ground. This rate of descent was associated with a decrease in airspeed from 130 knots to 92 knots over a span of 30 seconds. The airplane's rate of descent leveled off at the 1,300-fpm rate for 45 seconds before increasing to a 2,000 fpm descent rate. The true airspeed fluctuated between a low of 88 knots to 102 knots during the last 45 seconds of flight.  The Caravan contacted power lines and trees, and impacted the ground. Two of the witnesses reported that they observed between 1/4 and 1-inch of ice on the various protected and unprotected surfaces of the aircraft. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The flight crew's failure to cycle the deice boots prior to conducting a simulated forced landing and their failure to maintain adequate airspeed during the maneuver, which resulted in an inadvertent stall and subsequent loss of control.

When the aircraft was established on final approach, the Air Traffic Control (ATC) tower controller issued a landing clearance and reported the surface wind as being from 270 degrees at 23 knots. A further wind check was given about one minute later of 270 degrees at 22 knots gusting 32 knots, which was acknowledged by the crew.  The aircraft carried out an attempted landing in weather conditions of a gusting crosswind from the left. The aircraft bounced on the first landing and entered a series of divergent bounces, from the last of which a go-around was initiated. During the attempted landing the aircraft sustained damage to the nose landing gear following which it diverted to land successfully at Glasgow Airport where the wind conditions were more favourable.

The captain, who was the pilot flying and sitting in the right-hand seat, completed a normal takeoff. The flight took off from runway 27, over a lake. About 400 feet above ground level, the captain began a climbing right turn en route. During the turn, she had difficulty seeing the artificial horizon and concentrated on the aircraft's bank angle. The first officer called that the aircraft was in a 2000-feet-per-minute descent and took control. The aircraft struck the frozen surface of the lake, bounced, and became airborne again. The first officer retained control, and the captain attempted to feather the damaged right propeller. The first officer, believing that both propellers had sustained damage, force-landed the aircraft on the lake surface. The aircraft sustained substantial damage. FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1. The captain chose to fly the aircraft from the right seat during a night departure when not current to operate the aircraft from the right seat. 2. The captain did not set the instrument lighting correctly for the night take-off and was unable to use the artificial horizon effectively, resulting in the loss of situational awareness after take-off and the subsequent loss of control of the aircraft.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: TSB Report A03C0029 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Images: photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Sioux Lookout Airport, ON (YXL/CYXL); July 2001 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Despite numerous attempts, the copilot failed to contact Baucau ATS. The flight navigator then called Baucau Tower. A controller, who was present at Baucau aerodrome at the time, but not on operational duty, advised the flight crew that ATS was not available and that landing would be at the discretion of the flight crew. The pilot in command diverted the aircraft from the published inbound track to the Baucau NDB, and descended the aircraft below the published 10 NM MSA. He continued descending the aircraft through the commencement altitude for the published non-precision instrument approach for runway 14, and through the LSALT.  As the aircraft approached Baucau, the flight crew decided to conduct an overflight of the aerodrome before making a landing approach, and during the overflight, the flight crew realised that the runway was not where they expected it to be. It appeared that the crew did not use the Baucau NDB but used selected data from their instrument approach charts to formulate a user-defined non-precision approach using the onboard global positioning system (GPS). Adding to this, erroneous data on their Jeppesen charts meant the threshold of runway 14 was not where they thought it would be. Had the flight crew followed the non-precision runway 14 NDB approach procedure as published on either the CAD or Jeppesen charts, and not descended below the relevant MDA(H) until visual flight was assured, the position of the runway, as depicted on the Jeppesen charts would have been irrelevant.  During the overflight and the subsequent (first) landing approach, the flight crew realised that the runway was not where they expected it to be as it was depicted on the Jeppesen charts. The pilot in command discontinued the landing approach, and the flight navigator stated that he would apply a 4 km correction to position the aircraft for a second landing approach to where he thought the runway was located. By applying the 4 km correction, the flight navigator was providing the pilot in command with inaccurate data, and resulted in the aircraft being repositioned towards a point about 1.65 km (0.88 NM) northwest of the actual position of the threshold of runway 14. As the aircraft turned on to the final approach heading during the second landing approach, the flight navigator stated that the aircraft was high on the approach profile, based on his assumption of the location of the threshold of runway 14. The pilot in command increased the rate of descent of the aircraft to about 18 m/sec (3,543 fpm), and stated ÂIncreasedÂ. None of the other crewmembers commented on the high rate of descent, or drew the pilot in commandÂs attention to the fact that the approach was unstabilised at that point.  The flight engineer misinterpreted the pilot in commandÂs statement ÂIncreasedÂ to be an instruction for him to increase the engine thrust, and he advanced the thrust levers. It took about 2 seconds for the pilot in command to realise that engine thrust had been increased, and he reacted by calling ÂNo, I increased vertical speedÂ and reduced the engine thrust. The flight engineerÂs action in increasing engine thrust was a significant distraction to the pilot in command at that stage of the flight, and probably diverted his attention from the primary task of flying the aircraft to restoring the thrust to the proper setting. At about the same time, the aircraft descended through 162 m, which was the published MDH for a straight-in landing on the runway 14 NDB approach. Neither the pilot in command nor the copilot appeared to notice that the aircraft had descended through the MDH, and it is probable that both were distracted by the flight engineerÂs erroneous action.  The high rate of descent continued unchecked until slightly less than 2 seconds before impact. It is probable that the pilot in command and the copilot were each unaware of the high rate of descent, because neither was monitoring the flight instruments while they were looking ahead of the aircraft and trying to establish visual contact with the ground. The pilot in command applied back elevator to increase the aircraft pitch attitude in response to the co-pilot's urgent expression of concern that impact with terrain seemed almost certain. However, the pilot in command did not simultaneously increase the engine thrust, and it remained unchanged. The airplane impacted the ground. The right wingtip of the aircraft struck a partially constructed house and the aircraft broke up. SIGNIFICANT FACTORS: 1. The flight crew did not comply the published non-precision instrument approach and/or missed approach procedures at Baucau during flight in instrument meteorological conditions. 2. The flight crew conducted user-defined non-precision instrument approaches to runway 14 at Baucau during flight in instrument meteorological conditions. 3. The pilot in command permitted the aircraft to descend below the MDA(H) published on both the Jeppesen and CAD runway 14 instrument approach charts during flight in instrument meteorological conditions. 4. The flight crew did not recognise the increased likelihood and therefore risk of CFIT. 5. The flight crew did not recognise or treat that risk in a timely manner.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ATSB Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) Cameo K.

They had begun reducing speed to turbulence penetration ""prior to encountering a few pockets of light chop at about FL240.""  The captain gave a ""PA to the FA'S and passengers leaving FL180, asking that the cabin be prepared for landing early, due to possible chop during our approach.""  They encountered a very brief pocket of moderate chop.  The seatbelt sign was on, the cabin crew was in the process of securing the cabin for landing, and the purser had made the announcement for passengers to prepare for landing right after the captain's pre-landing announcement.  Several minutes after the event, the number one flight attendant, advised the captain that two of the flight attendants in the aft part of the airplane had been injured during the turbulence event.  A convective SIGMET was valid for Florida and coastal waters at the time of the turbulence encounter.  Radar images from the Miami Weather Surveillance Radar (WSR-88D) identified multiple storm cells in the area at the time of the turbulence encounter.  The radar data indicated that the core intensity of these cells was strong to intense (40 to 50 dBZ).  A radar image taken about the time of the turbulence encounter shows the airplanes path came about five nautical miles from the core of one cell and three nautical miles from the core of a second cell.  During this event, the airplane experienced a 2.04 g vertical acceleration load,  6 degree of left roll and a pitch change from -0.4 degrees to -2.1 degrees.

The aircraft in question was owned by Mr Yu. M Kabanov, deputy director of the Aviation Complex Myachkovo (AKM) and used by the Borki Air Club. On the day of the accident 23 skydivers boarded the Let 410. This was illegal since the maximum number of skydivers allowed on a Let 410 is 12 with lateral seating. In this case nearly all skydivers were sitting on the airplane's floor, one even occupied the toilet. As a result the airplane was overloaded by 618 kg and the centre of gravity was probably about 32% MAC where the maximum rear CofG was 28% MAC. At an altitude of about 3900 metres eleven skydivers prepared to exit the plane. When four of them had gotten out the CofG moved further aft (probably to about 35%) causing the Let to pitch up. The plane stalled, fell to the left and descended out of control. At an altitude of 2000 metres the aft fuselage section failed. Several skydivers were thrown out and the airplane crashed in a field.Sources: Soviet Transports  CONCLUSION on the crash of the aircraft L -410UVP of 01032 FLA RF / Ministry of Transport  Gazeta.ru  ITAR-TASS   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Air AlgÃ©rie flight 6289 originated in Tamanrasset and was bound for Algiers, with an intermediate stop at Ghardaia. Takeoff was commenced from runway 02 with the co-pilot acting as pilot-in-command. The aircraft rotated and at 15:14:52 the co-pilot ordered the gear to be raised. At that moment, at a height of 78 feet and a speed of 158 kts, the no. 1 engine suffered a turbine failure. The captain took over control of the airplane. Three seconds later the co-pilot asked if she should raise the gear, but the captain did not respond. The 737 lost speed and at 15:15:06 the speed had dropped to 134 kts. Height at that moment was 398 ft. The aircraft, named ""Monts du Daia"", stalled and crashed and broke up on rocky terrain about 1645 metres past the runway. PROBABLE CAUSES: The accident was caused by the loss of an engine during a critical phase of flight, the non-retraction of the landing gear after the engine failure, and the Captain, the PNF, taking over control of the airplane before having clearly identified the problem. The following factors probably contributed to the accident: - the perfunctory flight preparation, which meant that the crew were not equipped to face the situation that occurred at a critical moment of the flight; - the coincidence between the moment the failure occurred and the request to retract the landing gear; - the speed of the event that left the crew little time to recover the situation; - maintaining an inappropriate rate of climb, taking into account the failure of one engine; - the absence of any teamwork after the engine failure, which led to a failure to detect and correct parameters related to the conduct of the flight (speed, rate of climb, configuration, etc.); - the takeoff weight being close to the maximum with a high aerodrome altitude and high temperature; - the rocky environment around the aerodrome, unsuitable for an emergency landing.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CNE Report number: Report 7t-z030306 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   AFP  La Tribune d'Algerie   Location  Images: photo (c) Harro Ranter; Paris-Orly Airport (ORY); 24 September 1994; (CC:by-nc-nd) photo (c) Peter Frei; ZÃ¼rich-Kloten Airport (ZRH); 24 May 1992 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates04-Jan-2025 08:36 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The intention was then to fly from Rumbek Aerodrome to Lokichoggio in Kenya. During the VFR flight to Rumbek Aerodrome, the crew experienced a north-easterly wind with extremely turbulent conditions. Prior to landing at Rumbek Aerodrome, the crew calculated the approach and landing indicated air speeds (IAS) to be 85 kts and 75 kts respectively. The crew then joined the circuit accordingly for landing on runway 01. Approximately 4 nm away from landing, the co-pilot warned the pilot-in-command of a whirlwind in the area, close to the threshold of runway 01. The whirlwind appeared to have dissipated and the pilot-in-command continued with the landing with full flaps. At approximately 100 ft above ground level and 100 m before the threshold of runway 01, the IAS suddenly decreased to 70 kts. The pilot-in-command said that he immediately selected full power in order to arrest the rate of descent as wind shear in Southern Sudan and especially at Rumbek at this time of the year was a common factor. The aircraft nevertheless continued to descend and the left-hand propeller and left-hand main landing gear collided with a tree approximately 20 m before the threshold of runway 01. The tree was approximately 6 ft high and on an embankment. The aircraft then struck a drainage ditch before the threshold, causing the left-hand main landing gear to collapse. The airplane bounced and landed on the runway. The co-pilot immediately retracted the flaps and the aircraft continued down the runway on the right-hand main landing gear, but as its speed decayed, the left-hand propeller impacted with the runway surface. The aircraft veered to the left off the runway and entered a drainage ditch parallel to the runway. Both left and right-hand main landing gear were torn out of their attachment points and the aircraft eventually came to rest on its lower fuselage section.  The crew and passengers sustained no injuries and evacuated the aircraft safely through the emergency exits and rear main entry door. The aircraft was substantially damaged: both left and right-hand main landing gear were damaged; the left-hand outboard aileron was forced out of the outboard hinge point, and the lower fuselage frame and attachment stringers subsequently collapsed and were damaged.  The aircraft was temporary repaired on site by replacing two main landing gear, tailwheel, two engines, two props, one aileron and some skin repair. It was flown back to South Africa on 17 April 2003.Sources: CAA S.A.

When the captain rotated the airplane for lift-off the tail struck the runway and scraped for some 490 metres until the airplane became airborne. The tail strike occurred because the rotation speed was 33 knots less than the 163 knots required for the airplane weight. The rotation speed had been mistakenly calculated for an airplane weighing 100 tonnes less than the actual weight of 9V-SMT. A takeoff weight transcription error, which remained undetected, led to the miscalculation of the takeoff data, which in turn resulted in a low thrust setting and excessively slow takeoff reference speeds. The system defences did not ensure the errors were detected, and the airplane flight management system itself did not provide a final defence against mismatched information being programmed into it. During the takeoff the airplane moved close to the runway edge and the pilots did not respond correctly to a stall warning.

The pilot and five passengers were fatally injured. One passenger was seriously injured, and one person inside the building received minor injuries.  The accident flight departed the Bedford-Hanscom Field, MA (BED) at 07:00, and flew to New York-La Guardia Airport, NY (LGA) with only the pilot and pilot-rated passenger onboard. At LaGuardia, five additional passengers boarded the airplane, which subsequently departed on an IFR flight plan to Bedford. While en route, the crew amended the destination to Fitchburg. According to the surviving passenger, the intent was to drop off two passengers at Fitchburg, then continue on to the Martha's Vineyard Airport, MA (MVY), with the remaining passengers. While on approach to Fitchburg Airport, the airplane entered a left turn, which the surviving passenger described as ""almost completely upside down."" The airplane briefly levelled, then entered another left turn with a bank angle of the same severity. The airplane seemed to roll level, then entered a steep dive, until it impacted a building. The passenger reported that the engines were running normally throughout the entire flight, and the steep turns performed by the pilot did not concern her, as she had flown with him before and knew he ""liked to make sharp turns."" Examination of the airplane and engines revealed no pre-impact mechanical anomalies, and weather at the time of the accident included a broken cloud ceiling of 1,100 feet, with 3 miles visibility in mist.  Toxicology testing performed on the pilot revealed imipramine and carbamazepine in the pilot's urine and blood, and morphine in the pilot's urine. According to the pilot's medical and pharmacy records, he suffered from a severe neurological disorder, possibly a seizure disorder, which resulted in frequent, unpredictable episodes of debilitating pain. Additionally, approximately three months prior to the accident, the pilot was diagnosed with viral meningitis, and a severe skin infection with multiple abscesses on his extremities. The pilot had been prescribed imipramine, an antidepressant that has detrimental effects on driving skills and other cognitive functions. He had also been prescribed carbamazepine, typically used to control seizures or treat certain chronically painful conditions. Carbamazepine has measurable impairment of performance on a variety of psychomotor tests. Morphine, a prescription opiate painkiller, is also a metabolite of heroin and many prescription medications, such as codeine, used to control moderate pain. No indication was observed in the pilot's medical records that he was recently prescribed any opiates. Neither the pilot's medical condition, nor the medication he was routinely taking was reported on his application for an airman medical certificate. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The pilot's low altitude maneuver using an excessive bank angle, and his failure to maintain airspeed which resulted in an inadvertent stall and subsequent collision with a building. A factor was the pilot's impairment from prescription medications.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: IAD03FA043 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight took place under instrument flight rules. Using radar vectors, EC-HFA was cleared at 12:05 for an ILS approach to runway 14. The right hand seat on the flight deck was occupied by a PPL-rated passenger. During approach, the passenger read out various checklist points, which were each confirmed or commented upon by the pilot. At 12:06:39, at a distance of approximately 10 NM from ILS DME 14, the aircraft descended below 4000 ft QNH. At 12:07:07 the ATCO informed the pilot that he would be allowed to leave 4000 ft QNH only at a distance of 8 NM from ILS DME 14. The aircraft was already at 3600 ft, so he instructed EC-HFA to climb to 4000 ft QNH in order to be able to reach the ILS glide slope. The pilot answered: ""(...) I got the ILS catched, but I go to 4000 ft."" Subsequent to this radio conversation, the passenger mentioned the following to the pilot, with reference to the approach chart: ""Lo pone aquÃ­. Tenemos las montaÃ±as ahÃ­ Â Here it is. We have hills there."" EC-HFA then climbed back to an altitude of 4000 ft QNH, which it reached at approximately 8 NM. At about 7 NM, it began the descent and therefore found itself above the ILS glide slope. With the message ""All stations, ah... we have now RVR one thousand four hundred metres, thatÂs ah... showers of snow coming ah... overhead the field and the final, out."" at 12:07:41, the Zurich final ATCO informed all aircraft on the frequency that a snow shower was approaching the airport. A little later, the ATCO asked EC-HFA whether the aircraft was now stabilised on the ILS; the pilot confirmed this. At this time the aircraft was between 7 NM and 8 NM from the threshold of runway 14, approximately 200 ft above the glide slope. The ATCO also informed the pilot that the runway visual range (RVR) was now 1200 m. The pilot thanked him and asked the passenger to continue reading out the checklist. When the aircraft was approximately six miles from the threshold of runway 14, EC-HFA was asked to contact Zurich aerodrome control. This was confirmed by the pilot on the radio. He repeated the frequency several times to the passenger, who was busy entering the frequencies in this phase of the flight. At 12:09:10, the pilot contacted aerodrome control. There followed a further discussion between the two persons in the cockpit during which the passenger mentioned that it was now essential to fly precisely straight, because there was a 2500 m high tower to one side. It is highly probable that the passenger was referring to an obstacle which is shown on the approach chart with a tower symbol. This obstacle is approximately 9 NM from ILS DME 14, just to the east of the approach centreline and shows an altitude of 2566 ft AMSL. The passenger further suggested that for this reason the autopilot should be used. He finally quoted the value of 2200 ft and asked the pilot whether he did not want to set the flaps to ""full flaps"" position. At this time, EC-HFA received landing clearance for runway 14. This was immediately acknowledged by the pilot. The pilot then confirmed with the words: ""Full flaps... landing gear"" that everything was now ready for the landing. According to the radar recordings, throughout the final approach phase EC-HFA was always between 200 and 300 ft above the glide slope. At approximately 12:11:15, EC-HFA reached the decision height of 1602 ft. The passenger asked the pilot not to fly manually but to continue to let the autopilot fly EC-HFA, because there was no ground contact at this time. Shortly afterwards, the passenger mentioned that he could now see some of the ground. A few seconds later, the passenger said: ""Arrivando...Pista, ahÃ­!...La vÃ©s?...Muy bien, vamos muy bien. Dejalo, dejalo que baje - WeÂre arriving... The runway, there!... Do you see it?... Very good, weÂre very good. Let her go, let her go, she has to descend."" At 12:11:14 the aircraft touched down on the grass about 700 m before the runway threshold and skidded in a wide right turn in the direction of the threshold of runway 16. CAUSE: ""The accident is attributable to the fact that the pilot, with insufficient visual references, continued his approach below the minimum and the aircraft collided with the ground approximately 700 m before the threshold of runway 14. The following factors contributed to the accident: - unsatisfactory flying qualification on the aircraft type involved in the accident. - distraction by the passenger during the entire approach and at the decision height.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BFU Switz.

The airplane was scheduled to depart at 1100, but was delayed due to the previous flight crews' report of a take off slat warning light indication problem. A maintenance check was completed and pushback for the next flight occurred at 1206. At 1224, while the crew was completing the pre-take off checks during the taxi, the captain reported another take off slat warning light indication problem. Maintenance requested that the captain return the airplane to the gate so a technician could reexamine the fault. At 1241, a maintenance technician assessed the problem and stated to the captain that ""were gonna [sic] have to mess up with your takeoff condition here and you know after we do this, you're not supposed to move anything."" The captain stated ""right."" The maintenance check procedures required that ""either or both"" engine throttles to be advanced to verify the operation of the warning horn. The operation of the system was verified and the slats were set in the takeoff configuration. During the entire maintenance check, the captain and first officer remained seated. At 1251, the first officer called for and received pushback clearance. The engines were started during pushback, and the captain stated that ""prior to the engine start sequence, I did not direct re-accomplishment of the before start checklist."" The captain said ""the pushback and initial stages of the engine start sequence appeared normal."" However, shortly after engine start and with the tug still attached, the airplane began to move forward under its own power. At that time, the captain noticed that the throttles were still advanced. The captain and first officer both reached to pull the engine throttles back to idle, but the airplane had moved forward enough to cause the tug and tow bar to jackknife to the left, striking the airplane and leaving a 4-foot long gash in the fuselage. The captain shut down the engines, secured the cockpit, and assessed the situation. Probable Cause: the flight crew's failure to maintain aircraft control, which resulted in engine start with the throttles advanced and the subsequent impact with the tug. Contributing factors include, the flight crew's improper procedures/directives and failure to re-accomplish the before start checklist, the captain's diverted attention, the manufacturer's inadequate MEL procedures, the manufacturer's insufficiently defined conditions/steps, and the tug.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DEN03FA070 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DEN03FA070 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates13-Oct-2022 14:56 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

A bang was heard from the rear of the fuselage. The aircraft commenced an uncommanded pitch-up to a near-vertical attitude, then stalled, nosed over, and began a spin to the left. The crew countered the spin but the aircraft continued to descend in a near-vertical dive. Through the application of full-up elevator and the manipulation of power settings, the pilots were able to bring the aircraft to a near-horizontal attitude. The crew extended the landing gear and issued a Mayday call, indicating that they were conducting a forced landing. The aircraft struck a knoll, tearing away the belly cargo pod and the landing gear. The aircraft bounced into the air and travelled approximately 180 metres, then contacted a barbed-wire fence and slid to a stop approximately 600 metres from the initial impact point. FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1. During flight, the horizontal stabilizer trim actuator worked free of the mounting structure, and as a result, the flight crew lost pitch control of the aircraft. 2. During replacement of the horizontal stabilizer trim actuator, the upper attachment bolts were inserted through the airframe structure but did not pass through the upper mounting lugs of the trim actuator. 3. The improperly installed bolts trapped the actuator mounting lug assemblies, suspending the weight of the actuator and giving the false impression that the bolts had been correctly installed. 4. Dual inspections, ground testing, and flight testing did not reveal the faulty attachment.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: TSB Report A03C0094 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: CBC  Images: photo (c) Elliott Greenman, via Werner Fischdick; Hagerstown-Wash.

There were 163 passengers and six crew members on board. Three passengers were slightly injured. JAS Flight 979 took off from Kagoshima Airport at 15:35 and flew to Tokunoshima Airport. On landing at Tokunoshima Airport runway 01, the aircraft's left main landing gear (MLG) collapsed during rollout and its left wing tip contacted the ground. The aircraft came to a stop on the runway. PROBABLE CAUSE: In this accident, it is estimated that due to the left main landing gear cylinder collapsed immediately after the aircraft landed at Tokunoshima Airport, the fuselage inclined to the left and the aircraft traveled with its left wing in contact with the runway surface, resulting substantial damage.  With respect to the collapse of the MLG cylinder, it is considered that Gear Walks which experienced before the restrictor was installed generated large stresses on the fuse section of the cylinder surface and caused micro cracks. The micro cracks are considered to grow during normal operation and eventually lead to the fracture.  Further, it is considered that the presence of surface flaw on the cylinder caused by grit-blast contributed to the crack generation. And the contributing factor to the fact that the company could not detect the cracks on the cylinder by the scheduled maintenance, etc. is considered to be that the manufacturer had not established appropriate inspection intervals or inspection times to detect fatigue cracking.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ARAIC Report number: AA2006-3 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Yomiuri   Location  Images: photo (c) JTSB; Tokunoshima Airport (TKN/RJKN); January 2004 photo (c) JTSB; Tokunoshima Airport (TKN/RJKN); January 2004 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

On board were 135, mostly French, holidaymakers who were heading home.  At 04:38 the flight was cleared to taxi to runway 22R for departure. After takeoff, at 04:42, the plane climbed and maneuvered for a procedural left turn to intercept the 306 radial from the Sharm el-Sheikh VOR station. When the autopilot was engaged the captain made an exclamation and the autopilot was immediately switched off again. The captain then requested Heading Select to be engaged. The plane then began to bank to the right. The copilot then warned the captain a few times about the fact that the bank angle was increasing. At a bank angle of 40 degrees to the right the captain stated ""OK come out"". The ailerons returned briefly to neutral before additional aileron movements commanded an increase in the right bank. The aircraft had reached a maximum altitude of 5460 feet with a 50 degrees bank when the copilot stated: ""Overbank"". Repeating himself as the bank angle kept increasing. The maximum bank angle recorded was 111 degrees right. Pitch attitude at that time was 43 degrees nose down and altitude was 3470 feet. The observer on the flight deck, a trainee copilot, called ""Retard power, retard power, retard power"". Both throttles were moved to idle and the airplane gently seemed to recover from the nose-down, right bank attitude. Speed however increased, causing an overspeed warning. At 04:45 the airplane struck the surface of the water in a 24 degrees right bank, 24 degrees nose-down, at a speed of 416 kts and with a 3,9 G load. The wreckage sank to a depth of approx. 900 metres. CONCLUSION: ""No conclusive evidence could be found from the findings gathered through this investigation to determine the probable cause. However, based on the work done, it could be concluded that any combination of these findings could have caused or contributed to the accident.  Although the crew at the last stage of this accident attempted to correctly recover, the gravity upset condition with regards to attitude, altitude and speed made this attempt insufficient to achieve a successful recovery.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ECAA Report number: Report su-f040103a Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   AFP  BEA  Reuters   Location  Images: photo (c) Frank Ellemers; Sharm el Sheikh; 20 April 2012 photo (c) JosÃ© RamÃ³n Valero; Madrid-Barajas Airport (MAD); 08 August 2003 photo (c) Panagiotis A.

A few minutes before 8 o'clock in the morning the crew were cleared to descend from FL280 to FL100. The ice detection system was triggered during descent to FL100. Engine and airframe anti-icing systems were switched on simultaneously. FL100 was reached at 07:59:58 hrs. The pilots stated that they encountered icing conditions when the airplane entered the clouds. At FL100 ice is reported to have formed at the windscreen edges. Vibrations on the no. 2 engine increased temporarily after a flight time of six minutes at FL100. As the airplane was approximately 12.5 NM south of Munich airport, the crew was instructed to descend to FL90 and to change heading to 020 degrees. Heavy vibrations on the no. 2 engine occurred during descent. According to crew statements, the airbrakes were extended in order to increase thrust setting on the engines without increase in airspeed. Immediately afterwards the warning VIB HIGH ENG2 was triggered at FL90. The actions of the Abnormal Procedure Vibration High checklist were carried out. However, the no. 2 engine was not shut down for lack of other failure indications. Afterwards no more problems for the no. 2 engine were indicated. Simultaneously with the strong vibrations, vibrations and noises from the rear cabin area were heard in the cockpit. At 08:08:14 hrs the EPR of the no. 1 engine dropped from 1.5 to 1.1 and stayed at about 1.0 after that. In the cockpit heavy vibrations had been noticed also and a rattling noise had been heard. But the vibrations were not displayed on the multifunctional display as originating from the engines. At 08:08:22 hrs, the captain declared an emergency because of severe engine problems and requested an immediate landing. The airplane was immediately cleared to descend to 5,000 ft based on a QNH of 1,017 hPa and to change to a heading of 080 degrees. The crew requested an approach as short as possible. While leaving FL90, the EPR of the no. 1 engine dropped also from 1.4 to 1.0 within the next four minutes; this EPR reduction was incremental and occurred independent of the thrust setting. At 7,000 ft the air brakes were extended for a short time and engine thrust increased. During the descent to 5,000 ft the airplane was transferred to Munich Director. After 08:12:45 hrs when the airplane had reached approximately 5,000 ft the EPR of the no. 2 engine retained values of about 1.0 also. Munich Director immediately issued a clearance to further descend to 3,500 ft. The air brakes where extended again for a period of 44 seconds. Thereby the airspeed was reduced to approximately 170 kt. With the landing gears extended and the flaps set to 15 degrees, the airspeed was about 150 kt. The airplane was guided to the landing course of the ILS 26L approximately 8 NM in front of the threshold. At approximately 4,000 ft flaps were extended to 25 degrees. After the airplane had descended in landing configuration to the cleared altitude of 3,500 ft and horizontal flight had been established, the crew noticed that by pushing the thrust levers forward, the EPR on both engines did not increase to the required value. The speeds N1 and N2 and the exhaust gas temperatures (EGT) of both engines increased, the EPRs, however, remained at values of around 1.0. After the message of the crew that they were just approaching the ILS the flight was transferred to Munich Tower. Airspeed decreased to approximately 115 kt. The autopilot was immediately switched off, the airplane again established in descent, the flaps reset to 15 degrees and the landing gears retracted. Airspeed increased to approximately 135 kt. The flaps were again set to 25 degrees. The airplane received clearance to land. At 08:16:10 hrs the controller informed the crew that the Fokker was approximately 500 ft below the glide path. At this time the height measured by the radio altimeter was 500 ft AGL. At the same time the GPWS sounded: ""Too low"" and ""Gear"". The crew informed the controller that the runway could not be reached and that the landing would take place approximately 4 NM short of the runway: ""...We will not make it...to the runway...we are touching down probable 4 Miles before the field...""). From approximately 400 ft AGL downwards the airplane was clear of clouds. The landing gear was selected down 13 seconds prior to ground contact. The captain informed the cabin crew of the imminent emergency landing through the repeated exclamation ""Brace for impact"" 5 seconds prior to touch down. At 08:16:35 hrs, the airplane touched down on a snow covered field approximately 2.5 NM short of the runway with landing gears partly extended and came to rest severely damaged lying on the fuselage after a sliding distance of 220 m. All occupants left the airplane without assistance via the forward passenger door exit. The accident was due to the following immediate causes: - After a prolonged time under moderate icing conditions and low engine thrust, ice developed on the rotors of the low pressure compressors of both engines. - The bonded joints of the ice impact panels on both engines failed due to strains caused by ice-induced vibrations of the engines and by ice which had shedded from the rotors of the low pressure compressor. - The loose ice impact panels became trapped in front of the outlet guide vanes of the low pressure compressor and affected the airflow in the by-pass duct in such a way that the engines now only produced low thrust. - The runway was no longer within reach of the aircraft as the loss of thrust on both engines had not triggered any warnings and was not indicated until the necessary demand of thrust at an altitude of 3,500 ft. - Due to its nature the terrain within reach was not suited for the landing of a transport airplane.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BFU Report number: BFU AX001-0/04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   Austrian Airlines  BFU History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  26 March 2024 5Y-MMB unknown 0 Nairobi-Wilson Airport (WIL/HKNW) non Taxiway excursion Images: photo (c) Vuxi; near MÃ¼nchen; January 2004; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) Werner Fischdick; DÃ¼sseldorf Airport (DUS); 28 September 2002 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

This caused the aircraft to pivot so that it's nose went through the hangar door before it came to a stop. The crew reported that as they were making a left turn, nose-wheel steering became insufficient as the turn tightened. To compensate, a small amount of brake pressure was was applied on the left wheel. The captain felt that this amount of braking was inadequate, so maximum brake pressure was applied on the left wheel. This had no effect, resulting in the collision with the hangar. The emergency braking system was not used. Of the two crew and six passengers, three of the passengers reported neck problems. Upon investigation, no defects were found in the braking system, and it is unknown whether the antilock braking system activated during the event. According to the aircraft manufacturer, it is possible that the degraded turn performance was a result of the left wheel locking up. The surface was wet from rainfall, and the tight left turn would reduce weight on the left wheel. Both of these factors decrease traction, increasing the likelihood of the left wheel locking up. Although it was not determined if the brakes were tested before commencing the taxi, the Dutch Safety Board reccomended that testing of the brakes always be carried out before taxiing. This gives an earlier opportunity for the crew to activate the emergency braking system.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Dutch Safety Board Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: Dutch Safety Board Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates25-Sep-2020 15:13 ASN Update Bot Added 25-May-2022 05:29 harro Updated [Total fatalities, Other fatalities, Damage, ]13-Jun-2022 20:22 Ron Averes Updated [Location, ]12-Oct-2024 14:52 Justanormalperson Updated [Operator, Destination airport, ] Corrections or additions? ...

Weather was poor as the flight approached the airport. After reporting capturing the glideslope the air traffic controller reported a vertical visibility of 60 m and a runway visual range of 1300 m. About 12,5 km out, the aircraft's rate of descent increased, causing it to descend below the glideslope. The rate of descent was arrested at a height of 170 m, 8 km from the threshold of runway 08L and they continued in level flight. At the Outer Marker (3,5 km from the runway) they should have started their initial approach, but the crew continued level flight thus flying above the glideslope now. With 2,5 km to go the airplane descended slightly at 1-1,5 m/sec. At the Inner Marker the descent rate increased to 2-2,6 m/sec. The crew then probably saw the runway lights below them. The engines were brought back to idle and reverse thrust was applied at a height of 60 m. When it appeared that they would not be able to land given the remaining runway length, reverse thrust was deselected and engine power was increased. At that point the airplane touched down 260 m past the end of the runway. It continued until the right wing struck a concrete building.

At 15:55, the aircraft was de-iced and departed ten minutes later. The aircraft landed at 16:20. While on the ramp, two individuals voiced concern to the pilot that there was ice on the wing. Freezing precipitation was falling. The pilot was observed to visually check the leading edge of the wing; however, he did not voice any concern and proceeded with loading the passengers and cargo. At approximately 16:38, flight GGN126 departed Pelee Island for Windsor. After using most of the runway length for takeoff, the aircraft climbed out at a very shallow angle. The pilot raised the flaps while over Lake Erie. The Caravan then entered an aerodynamic stall. Because the plane was rolling into a climbing right turn, the left wing stalled first. The nose dropped and the airplane rolled to the left. The airplane was too low for recovery and struck the ice. It was determined that the aircraft was overweight by 1270 pounds (576 kg) when it departed Pelee Island. The maximum takeoff weight for this flight was 8550 pounds (3878 kg). FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1. At take-off, the weight of the aircraft exceeded the maximum allowable gross take-off weight by at least 15 per cent, and the aircraft was contaminated with ice. Therefore, the aircraft was being flown significantly outside the limitations under which it was certified for safe flight. 2. The aircraft stalled, most likely when the flaps were retracted, at an altitude or under flight conditions that precluded recovery before it struck the ice surface of the lake. 3. On this flight, the pilot's lack of appreciation for the known hazards associated with the overweight condition of the aircraft, ice contamination, and the weather conditions was inconsistent with his previous practices. His decision to take off was likely adversely affected by some combination of stress and fatigue.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A04H0001 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   TSB  Transport Canada   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The captain stated that he had turned on all the lights required by the operating procedures (position lights, anti-collision light) and that he had also turned on the taxi lights. While the aircraft was traveling along taxiway NG, just before arriving abeam apron D, a blow was felt coming from the front left of the aircraft. The blow had been produced by the collision with a passenger bus, which had invaded the taxiway along a rolling road that crossed taxiway NG from left to right (with respect to the route of the aircraft).  There were no injuries. The Metro suffered substantial damage to the left hand wing tip. PROBABLE CAUSE (translated from Italian):  The accident was caused by the presence of a passenger bus inside the airport grounds on the taxiway used by an aircraft at the same time.  Among the factors that contributed to the event was the situation of poor visibility, determined by the light conditions (21.07 local time), the weather conditions, the position of the ""STOP"" signal too far back to have a good view of the traffic moving on the TWY, the artifacts in the area of the event. The above situation - probably not considered during the training phase of the airport drivers - led to the failure of the passenger vehicle to comply with the regulations contained in the DCA ordinance no. 24/98 (a taxiing aircraft always takes precedence over any vehicle circulating at the airport).Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ANSV Report number: A/35/04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  8 January 1982 HB-LNB Crossair 0 ZÃ¼rich-Kloten Airport (ZRH) min Runway excursion Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The copilot was Pilot Flying. The Beech took off at 20:30 and arrived near GhardaÃ¯a fourteen minutes later.  At 20:44 the flight was cleared for a right hand circuit in preparation for an approach to runway 30. At that moment a Boeing 727 was on long finals. The copilot stated that he intended to carry out an NDB/ILS approach to runway 30. The captain however preferred a visual approach. The copilot carried out the captain's course and descent instructions with hesitation. At 20:57, the EGPWS alarm sounded. Power was added and a climb was initiated from a lowest altitude of 240 feet above ground level. The captain then took over control and assumed the role of Pilot Flying. The airplane manoeuvred south of the airport until 21:01 when the copilot saw the runway. The captain rolled left to -57Â° and pitched down to -18.9Â° in order to steer the airplane towards the runway. Again the EGPWS sounded but the descent continued until the airplane impacted the ground and broke up. The five occupants survived the impact, but the co-pilot died a day later of his injuries. Causes of the accident (translated from French): The Commission believes that the accident can be explained by a series of several causes which, taken separately, would not lead to an accident. The causes are related to: 1 - the lack of rigor in the approach and landing phase evidenced by a failure to follow standard operating procedures, including the arrival checklist. 2 - the failure to strictly comply with the holding, approach and landing procedures in force for the aerodrome of GhardaÃ¯a. 3 - the fact that the captain seemed occupied by the visual search maneuvers that put him temporarily out of the control loop. He was so focused on the visual search for the runway and abandoned the monitoring of parameters that are critical for the safety of the flight. This concentration completely disoriented him. 4 - the fact that the crew did not respond appropriately to different alarms that occurred, indicating a lack of control in the operation of the aircraft in that kind of situation. Lack of control was apparently due to his lack of training on this aircraft type. 5 - The activities in the southern part of Algeria may cause a certain routine that can promote the tendency to conduct visual approaches. It seems, indeed, that the crew is more experienced in visual flights. 6 - A lack of coordination and communication between the crew members flying together for the first time.Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) Archives; Hassi Messaoud-Oued Irara Airport (HME); January 2004 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane was operated by Phoenix Aviation and chartered by ExpoAir. Using GPS and DME the airplane approached Colombo. The approach controller cleared flight 3002 to descend to FL150. After reaching that altitude the navigator passed on the QNH and QFE values for Colombo: 1009 mb and 756 mm Hg. The altimeters were updated with this information. However, the copilot erroneously programmed 765 mm Hg into the altimeter. After turning left onto finals the aircraft, 14 km from the runway, descended to an altitude above sea level of 60 meters. The airplane descended slowly until the landing gear contacted the surface of the sea at a distance of 10,7 km short of runway 04. Climb power was applied and the navigator reported that they were going around: ""PHG 3-0-0-2 go around, again I call you established localizer"". At a height of 60-90 meters however, the captain decided to continue the approach. Assuming the undercarriage had been substantially damaged, he decided to carry out a belly landing on the side of the runway. Touchdown was accomplished 50 meters to the right of the runway and 450 meters passed the threshold. The aircraft skidded and came to rest 2230 meters further on. The Ilyushin was away and parked in a corner of the airport, where it was still noted in May 2004.Sources: Information on the aviation incident with the aircraft IL-18D EX-005 / Russian Ministry of Transport   Location  Images: photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Sharjah Airport (SHJ); December 2002 photo (c) Aktug Ates; Antalya Airport (AYT); 06 May 2001 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates25-Nov-2024 14:45 ASN Updated [Operator, ]25-Nov-2024 14:45 ASN Updated [Location, Destination airport, ]25-Nov-2024 14:45 ASN Updated [Damage, ]10-Feb-2025 08:32 ASN Updated [Location, ]10-Feb-2025 08:33 ASN Updated [Destination airport, ]24-Feb-2025 19:11 ASN Updated [Operator, Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Following some upper level air work, the crew requested, and were granted a clearance for, a simulated engine failure and descent to 2,000 ft. The pilot in command retarded the power lever to the flight idle stop and the fuel condition lever to the low idle range, setting a value of 55% engine gas generator speed (Ng). The pilot under training then set the glide attitude at the best glide speed of about 79 knots indicated airspeed and feather the propeller The PIC reported that he instructed the pilot under training to advance the emergency power lever (EPL) to simulate manual introduction of fuel to the engine. He then noticed that there was no engine torque increase, with the engine inter-turbine temperature (ITT or T5) and Ng rapidly decreasing, and a strong smell of fuel in the cockpit. Despite several efforts to relight the engine, they were not successful. They then completed a successful landing in a depth of about 2 m of water near Green Island. The aircraft sustained minor damage during the ditching, but subsequent substantial damage due to salt water immersion. SIGNIFICANT FACTORS:  1. The pilots of CYC were conducting in-flight familiarization training using the emergency power lever. That procedure was not contained in the aircraft manufacturerÂs pilot operating handbook. 2. The engine manufacturerÂs documentation contained information on the use of the emergency power lever, which did not preclude the use of the emergency power lever for in-flight familiarization training. 3. The engine sustained a flameout at an altitude above mean sea level from which reignition of the engine was not successfully completed. 4. Erosion of the first-stage compressor blades would have reduced the aerodynamic efficiency of the compressor blades.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ATSB Report number: ATSB Occurrence 200400443 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: ATSB History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  12 March 1999 VH-CYC 0 4 km N Cairns Airport non Location  Images: photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Cairns Airport, QLD (CNS/YBCS); April 1997 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

A Fokker 50 passenger plane, operated by Kish Air, was destroyed when it crashed near Sharjah Airport (SHJ), United Arab Emirates. All six crew members and 37 of the 40 passengers were killed. The aircraft was operating as a scheduled flight from Kish Island, Iran to Sharjah, UAE with the captain initially as the pilot flying (PF).  During the cruise and just prior to descent, the captain unexpectedly handed over control of the aircraft to the First Officer prior to the approach to Sharjah. The first officer did not accept this willingly and stated that he was not confident of his ability to conduct a VOR/DME approach into Sharjah. This statement was not consistent with his previous experience and could indicate either a cultural or professional issue. The captain insisted the first officer fly the aircraft and encouraged and instructed him during the approach.  At 11:24 hours local time, the aircraft contacted Dubai Arrivals and was cleared from 9000 ft to 5000 ft and instructed to expect a VOR/DME approach to runway 12 at Sharjah International Airport. At 11:29 hours the aircraft was further cleared to 2500 ft and cleared for the approach. The aircraft was under its own navigation and the daylight conditions were fine with excellent visibility. At 11:35 hours the aircraft was instructed to contact Sharjah Tower and the pilot reported that the aircraft was established on the VOR final approach for runway 12. The Tower cleared IRK7170 to land and advised that the wind was calm.  At that point the aircraft was slightly above the approach profile. The initial speed for the approach was at least 50 kt high at approximately 190 kt with no flap and no landing gear. The aircraft should have been configured with landing gear down and flap 10Â° during the approach and stabilized at 130 kt prior to the MDA. Approaching the MDA at flight idle setting, the auto-pilot was disengaged and the first Officer called for flap 10 at 186 kt (limiting speed of 180 kt) and flap 25 was selected by the Captain, a setting uncalled for by the Pilot Flying at 183 kt (limiting speed of 160 kt), and the landing gear was called for and selected at approximately 185 kt (limiting speed of 170 kt). The captain then took control of the aircraft and shortly afterwards the ground range selectors were heard by Cockpit Voice Recorder to be lifted and the power levers moved from the flight idle stop into the ground control range.  The left propeller then went to full reverse whilst the right propeller remained in positive pitch within the ground control range. The aircraft descended in an extreme nose low left bank attitude until impact. The aircraft crashed 2.6 nm from the runway onto an unprepared sandy area adjacent to a road and residential buildings. The aircraft broke apart on impact and a fire started immediately. Cause:  The power levers were moved by a pilot from the flight idle position into the ground control range, which led to an irreversible loss of flight control.  Contributory Causes: 1. By suddenly insisting the First Officer fly the final approach, the pilot in command created an environment, which led to a breakdown of crew resource management processes, the non observance of the operatorÂs standard operating procedures and a resultant excessive high approach speed.  2. An attempt to rectify this excessive high approach speed most likely resulted in the non compliance with the Standard Operating Procedures and the movement of the power levers below flight idle.  3.  The unmodified version of the Skid Control Unit failed to provide adequate protection at the time of the event.Sources: SKYbraryÂ   GulfNews  ICAO Adrep  Kish Air crash due to human factors: probe (Khaleej Times, 20 April 2006)  BBC, IRNA   Location  Images: photo (c) ; Sharjah Airport (SHJ); February 2004 photo (c) ; Sharjah Airport (SHJ); February 2004 photo (c) Dmitry Avdeev; Sharjah Airport (SHJ); 12 January 2005; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) Ger Buskermolen; Sharjah Airport (SHJ); 09 February 2004 photo (c) Heinz Rentmeister; Sharjah Airport (SHJ); 09 February 2004 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates03-Jan-2025 12:21 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The shimmying stopped when braking was reduced but restarted when braking was increased, causing the torsion link to fracture. Further higher amplitude shimmying of the left MLG ensued, resulting in severe MLG tyre, wheel and brake damage and substantial oscillatory loads on the aircraft structure. Steering difficulties were experienced during both shimmying episodes. It was likely that the shimmying resulted from excessive wear of the torsion link apex joint that reduced the effectiveness of the shimmy damper. Maintenance records indicated that the MLG had been maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations, but it was considered that relevant Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) procedures could be difficult to follow.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: EW/C2004/02/03 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: AAIB Bulletin 4/2005 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  3 June 2009 VP-BXM Aeroflot-Nord 0 Simferopol Airport (SIP) sub Images: photo (c) AAIB; 21 February 2004 photo (c) Ian Jenkins; London-Heathrow Airport (LHR/EGLL) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Both airplanes sustained substantial damage.  The 2 flight crewmembers, 1 cabin crewmember, and 29 passengers were uninjured.  Dark night visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.  The Push Tug Operator stated, ""In pushing back this plane I was attempting to do it as I was trained, that is, to [prop] the front wheels on the painted line.  I [normally] work on the east side and there is a line [used] for the front wheels.  I had not done [a] push back [on] the west side before.

She ran up to me and told me to stop but it was already [too] late.""  Excerpts from the airline's Station Operations Manual stated, ""The Pushback Operator and the Captain have the overall responsibility for the safe conduct of the pushback operation.  ... The Pushback Operator shall remain alert for signals given by the Wing Walker(s).  When Wing Walker(s) is/are used, if visual contact between the Pushback Operator and Wing Walker is lost, stop the pushback.  The Pushback Operator must continuously scan for signals and hazards.  ... Before pushback of an aircraft, the Pushback Operator shall : 1. Determine where the aircraft is to be pushed back to, positioned and route to be taken.  2. Note ALL potential clearance problems to be avoided.  ... 5. Review with the Captain the route to be taken.  ... During pushback of an aircraft, the Pushback Operator shall: 17.

ASSESS ROUTE, CLEARANCES AND RAMP CONDITIONS.""  The Push Tug Operator tested positive for cocaine metabolite.  14 CFR Part 121 Appendix I stated, ""Each person who performs a safety-sensitive function directly or by contract for an employer must be tested pursuant to an FAA-approved antidrug program conducted in accordance with this appendix.""  The Push Tug Operator was not on the FAA's safety-sensitive list.  An airline representative reported that the airline's policy is to accomplish a pre-employment drug test for all safety-sensitive and non safety-sensitive employees.  The Push Tug Operator's pre-employment drug test was reported as negative.  The airline had a drug policy and an employee assistance program in-place at the time of the accident.  An airline representative reported that the supervisor and coordinator for the accident gate area were two gates away and did not directly observe the accident pushback.  Subsequent to the accident, the airline established a policy of random drug testing for all employees as a condition of employment. Probable Cause: The visual lookout not maintained and the procedures not followed by the  Push Tug Operator during the pushback.  Factors were the parked airplane, the dark night, and the inadequate surveillance of the pushback by airline management.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CHI04LA077 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB CHI04LA077 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates12-Oct-2022 15:00 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

The airplane was on approach to Cagliari-Elmas Airport (CAG) following a domestic flight from Roma-Ciampino Airport (CIA).  On the evening of 23 February 2004, the Austrian air taxi operator City-jet was requested to carry out a flight from Cagliari-Elmas Airport (CAG), Sardinia, Italy to Roma-Ciampino Airport (CIA) and return.  The purpose of the flight was to transport a team of three doctors to Rome who would need to remove a organ for transplantation. The crew would wait at the airport to return to Cagliari with the medical staff and the organ.  CIT Flight 123 took off from Milan Linate at 22:22 and landed at Cagliari without incident at 00:02, February 24. After refueling (1100 liters) and the three passengers had boarded, the aircraft departed at 01:01 bound for Rome, where it landed at 01:51.  After arriving at Ciampino Airport, the crew filed an IFR flight plan for Cagliari, alternate Olbia, call sign CIT 124, with Estimated Off-Block Time (EOBT) 04:00. The flight was declared STS/HOSP (medical flight).  After arrival of the medical team, takeoff occurred at 05:00. The aircraft was authorized by Rome ACC to directly enter the airway M126, without carrying out the standard instrument departure. The en route part of the flight to Cagliari was uneventful.  At 05.37, Rome ACC instructed flight 124 to contact Cagliari APP, After radio contact was established , Cagliari APP provided the weather at the aerodrome: runway in use 32, wind 7 knots from 320Â°, visibility 12 km scattered clouds at 2000 feet, temperature 10Â° C, dew point 9Â° C, QNH 1012. At 05.41.12, Cagliari APP instructed CIT 124, which at that time was at the waypoint Aledo, to continue the descent over the next waypoint LEDRO up to 5000 feet, to carry out the ILS procedure for a landing on runway 32 and report at Carbonara VOR. The commander, reading back the instructions, requested permission to conduct a visual approach should he obtain visual contact with the airport: ""Roger, we are cleared now to descend to five thousand feet on the QNH one zero one two and we passing Ledro cleared by ILS three two papa and if we have field visually, we would like to have a visual approach."" This was confirmed by Cagliari APP. At 05:43 the flight crew radioed: ""CIT 124, we have the field in sight requesting visual approach."" At that time the aircraft was at FL 96, about 28 nm from Carbonara VOR and about 41 nm from Cagliari VOR. Cagliari APP then asked CIT 124 about the ability to maintain obstacle clearance: ""confirm able to maintain your own separation from the obstacles sir, performing visual approach runway three two"". The pilot just replied: ""affirmative, CIT 124"". About three minutes later, Cagliari APP informed CIT 124 to continue the descent without descending below 2500 feet and contact Elmas TWR for the further descent: ""[...] CIT 124 continue not below 2500 feet, further descent with Elmas Tower 120.6 bye"" The pilot contacted Elmas TWR at 05:47: ""Elmas Tower, buongiorno, CIT 124, visual, left procedure, for visual approach runway 32."" Elmas TWR responded by reporting the runway in use (32), wind conditions (8 knots from 310Â°), and told the flight to report on short final for runway 32. This was read back by the crew.  Two minutes later, while descending over mountainous terrain, flight 124 collided with the side of Su Baccu Malu Mountain (3333 feet). CAUSA E FATTORI CONTRIBUTIVI LÂincidente, classificabile come CFIT, Ã¨ stato causato dalla conduzione del volo ad una quota significativamente inferiore allÂaltitudine minima di settore, insufficiente a mantenere la separazione dal terreno, durante un avvicinamento a vista notturno in assenza di adeguati riferimenti visivi.  Sono stati individuati i seguenti possibili fattori contributivi dellÂincidente: - strumentazione dellÂaeromobile non comprendente uno strumento GPWS o TAWS, la cui installazione non Ã¨ richiesta dalla normativa; - lÂassunzione da parte dellÂequipaggio di riferimenti visivi erronei, confusi con le luci pista di Elmas, tenuto conto che lÂequipaggio non aveva particolare familiaritÃ  con la zona di Cagliari; lÂinsorgenza, nellÂequipaggio, di fenomeni di illusione ottica, con specifico riferimento al cosiddetto ""black hole approach""; - il fraintendimento, da parte dellÂequipaggio, dellÂistruzione data da Cagliari APP allÂatto del trasferimento a Elmas TWR (""CIT 124 continue not below 2500 feet, further descent with Elmas TWR 120.6 bye""), che potrebbe aver ingenerato il convincimento, malgrado lo stesso equipaggio avesse confermato di essere in grado di separarsi autonomamente dagli ostacoli, che la discesa fino a quella quota fosse libera da ostacoli; - mancato utilizzo delle procedure strumentali pubblicate e disponibili nella conduzione di avvicinamento su di un aeroporto e in unÂarea non conosciuti, in condizioni di totale oscuritÃ ; - lÂanticipazione della deviazione dallÂaerovia, forse decisa per cercare di accelerare lÂarrivo a destinazione, che ha determinato il sorvolo di aree di maggiore elevazione; - errori di lettura delle quote riportate nelle carte consultate, facilitati dalla mancata rappresentazione a colori del terreno; - il prolungato periodo di veglia senza adeguato riposo, che potrebbe aver contribuito a ridurre la performance dellÂequipaggio. translated from the original Italian text: CAUSE AND CONTRIBUTORY FACTORS The accident, classified as CFIT, was caused by the conduct of the flight at a height significantly below the Area Minimum Altitude, insufficient to maintain the separation from the ground during a night visual approach in the absence of adequate visual reference. possible contributory factors that have been identified: - The aircraft instrumentation did not include a GPWS or TAWS, whose installation is not required by law; - The erroneous descent by visual flight references, confusing the Elmas runway lights, given that the crew had no special familiarity with the area of Cagliari, the onset of a perspective illusions phenomena, with specific reference to the so-called ""black hole approach""; - The misunderstanding by crew members, of the Cagliari Approach controllers instruction to transfer to Elmas TWR (""CIT 124 continue not below 2500 feet, further descent with Elmas TWR 120.6 bye "") which may have created the impression, despite the crew had confirmed that they are able to separate themselves from the obstacles that the descent down was free of obstructions; - Failure to use published procedures and available instruments in a descent to a closer airport and in an unfamiliar area , under conditions of total darkness; - The anticipation of the deviation from the airway perhaps caused [the crew] to try to speed up the arrival at destination, which determined overflying areas of higher elevation; - Read errors of the elevations listed in the maps consulted, facilitated by the non representation of the ground color; - The extended period of wakefulness without adequate rest, which may have contributed to a reduction in the performance of the crew.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ANSV Report number: ANSV report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   ANSV   Location  Images: photo (c) Werner Fischdick; DÃ¼sseldorf Airport (DUS); 22 April 1985 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft diverted its course to Las Palmas airport, where the seriously injured passenger with signs of hemiplegia was disembarked to be taken to a hospital for medical assistance. There was no forecast turbulence in the area where the accident occurred. There were no visible clouds. No turbulence announcements were given and the fasten seat belt signs remained off. Causes The accident was caused by the penetration of the aircraft in an area of turbulence when passengers were not secured with their seat belts. The seat belt signs were not lit, because turbulence was not expected.

The airplane carried Macedonian President Boris Trajkovski and other officials. All aboard were killed in the accident. Based on the investigation and analysis of the collected evidence and documents available, the Commission concluded that the immediate cause of the aircraft accident of Beechcraft Super King Air 200 registration Z3-BAB was the following: Descending below the minimum descent altitude-MDA of 1810 feet for the published procedure for precision approach for landing at the airport in Mostar: 1:06 Mostar-LQMO, VOR/DME RWY 34 (Jeppesen 13-1), resulting in a Controlled Flight Into Terrain-CFIT. The main factors that have led to a descent below the minimum published heights are as follows: a) Very poor quality and lack of preparation of the crew for the approach and landing; b) Ignoring the information of air traffic controllers on the current meteorological situation at LQMO Airport; c) Wrong determination of the FAF (Final Approach Final Fix- point of access) and its replacement with the IAF (Intermediate Approach Fix- Central point of access) which led to an earlier start of the descent. d) To turn off the autopilot during the approach phase, taking into account the complex meteorological situation; e) Low crew teamwork (CRM Crew Resource Management) - lack of communication and failure to follow standard operating procedures; f) Failure to maintain level flight by Pilot Flying and inadequate response by pilots Assisting Pilot, at the stage of reaching the MDA Minimum Descent Altitude.METAR: 07:00 UTC / 08:00 local time:Wind from 340Â° at 10 kts; Visibility: 8 km; Scattered clouds at 600 feet; Broken clouds at 1600 feet and 7300 feet; Temperature: 5Â° C; Pressure: 1003 mbAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: MKT Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 10 years and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) Karl KrÃ¤mer, via Werner Fischdick; MÃ¼nchen-Franz Josef Strauss Airport (MUC/EDDM); February 2000 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The captain reported the seat belt sign was turned on as they descended through 18,000 feet.  He reported they encountered about 15 seconds of moderate turbulence as they passed through 16,000 feet.  He reported there were no weather returns in the area and they were back in smooth air after the encounter.  The first officer reported that he informed the flight attendants to take their seats as soon as they began to encounter the turbulence.  He reported he was getting ready to call the flight attendants after the turbulence to make sure they were alright, when the cockpit received a call from the back stating that one of the flight attendants injured her ankle.  The first officer reported that they requested paramedics meet the flight upon landing.  The injured flight attendant reported she was in the aft galley when they encountered the turbulence.  She stated she tried to get in the jumpseat, but was unable to because of the turbulence.  The injured flight attendant stated she heard another flight attendant tell a passenger who was in the aft galley to sit on the floor, so she decided to do the same.  She stated that as she was sitting down, the ""plane dropped"" and she fell.  Once the turbulence subsided, the other flight attendant and a passenger helped her off the floor and into a seat.  None of the flight attendants recalled having any advance warning of the turbulence.  Rapidly building convective activity was evident along the upper Mississippi Valley at the time of the accident.  Convective tops averaging FL250 in the area were moving north-northeast at 60 knots.  Severe Weather Advisory 15S, valid from 1731 universal coordinated time (UTC) to 2301 UTC, covered the route of flight from the Mississippi River to ORD.  The severe thunderstorm watch included a forecast for hail, surface wind gusts to 60 knots, maximum cloud tops to FL450, and a storm motion vector to 240 degrees at 35 knots.  Convective Sigmet 25C was valid until 2255UTC.  The Sigmet called for an area of embedded thunderstorms moving from 190 degrees at 20 knots.  The thunderstorms had tops to FL300.  Data from the digital flight data recorder shows the airplane experienced vertical acceleration fluctuations from a minimum of 0.437 g's, to a maximum of 1.994 g's, and back to 0.576 g's in less then 3 seconds.    Probable Cause: The unexpected encounter with convective turbulence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CHI04LA084 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB CHI04LA084  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates25-Mar-2024 10:01 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

In Ankara the airplane was loaded with 39980 kg of cargo. The next stop was Baku, Azerbaijan for refueling. The airplane took 47 tons of fuel, bringing the takeoff weight to 189 tons, and the centre of gravity to 29,3% MAC, which was within the prescribed limits. During the eight-hour stopover the crew decided to rest in the aircraft instead of a hotel. As the aircraft started taxiing to the runway the flight engineer was heard saying that he would select the flaps at 30 degrees and slats at 14 degrees for takeoff. This however was not done. Prior to takeoff the position of the flaps was not verified by any of the crew members. Takeoff was thus commenced with flaps and slats retracted and the stabilizer trimmed at the takeoff position -4 degrees (corresponding to actual takeoff weight, CofG and flaps at 30Â°). At a speed of 210 km/h the pilot pulled on the control column to lift off the nose gear. At a calculated unstick speed of 265 km/h the angle of attack reached 9 degrees but the plane did not lift off the runway. Accelerating through 290 km/h the angle of attack of the aircraft reached 14,5 degrees, setting off the angle of attack warning on the flight deck. Some 1750 meters down the runway, the aft fuselage struck the runway. Seventy meters further on, at a speed of 300 km/h and an angle of attack of 19,4Â°, the Ilyushin lifted off the runway. The air traffic controller who witnessed the departure advised the crew to abort the takeoff, but the captain apparently continued. The airplane rolled to the left until the wing contacted the runway. Then the flight engineer noted his error and, without informing the captain, began extending the flaps and slats. Again without informing the captain, the flight engineer brought back the power levers of the four engines to idle. After three seconds he moved them from idle to the 'engine shutdown' position. The captain three times yelled ""takeoff"" but the engines were already shut down. After flying for 490 meters the aircraft struck the ground and crashed.Sources: Information on the aviation incident with the aircraft Il-76TD UR-ZVA / Russian Ministry of Transport No. 22.15-568  MAK Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC)  RIA Novosti   Location  Images: photo (c) Oliver KÃ¶stinger; Sharjah Airport (SHJ/OMSJ) photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Oostende Airport (OST/EBOS); March 1995 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

After 01:20 of flight, the instruction phase for the first trainee was completed. When the Canadair stopped on the lake, the two co-pilots switched places. The second trainee took the controls and began his training session with hydroplaning in accordance with the training program. Before starting the next exercise, the instructor reminded the trainee of the actions to be taken to achieve this phenomenon. He reminded that the speed must remain below 55 kt.  The trainee, still at the controls, extended the flaps to 10Â°, the takeoff configuration. He then proceeded to accelerate the aircraft by advancing the throttle to obtain an engine torque close to that required for takeoff. As the Canadair accelerated, the trainee applied elevator to initiate the porpoise. The airspeed continued to increase and the Canadair took off without the porpoising phenomenon having occurred. The trainee moved the power levers to minimum. The aircraft struck the water and the crew felt a shock. As the aircraft continued to move through the water in deceleration, the instructor pointed out to the trainee the loss of the right-hand float. The instructor decided to abort the training mission and took over the controls to return to the Marseille-Provence Airport. The instructor then undertook to take off. As soon as the aircraft took off, it slowly tilted to the right even though the control column was positioned to the left. The instructor then positioned the control column to the left, but the bank continued to increase. The instructor told the two co-pilots that he was having difficulty controlling the aircraft. The co-pilot trainee, sitting in the middle seat, suggested switching to manual control. The instructor did not accept this option and put the aircraft in descent. He asked the trainee in the right seat to put the flaps in the 25Â° position which corresponded to the landing configuration. The aircraft, still banked and descending, hit the water with its right wing. The instructor and the trainee in the center seat died. The trainee in training was seriously injured. CAUSES OF THE ACCIDENT  (translation from French report) The accident is the consequence of a chain of causes of human origin which lead to the loss of control in roll of the aircraft:  The accident can be broken down into 2 phases:   - A first phase that leads to the damage of the flight controls during the impact with the water following the stall of the aircraft. The stall is the result of the trainee's failure to execute the flight controls, which was not countered by the instructor. The trainee's failure to perform at the very beginning of Canadair training was part of a context of:  -- a failure to comply with the training framework: Contrary to what the progression booklet states, the instructor did not demonstrate the porpoising. He entrusted the commands to the trainee.  -- pedagogical error: The instructor did not follow a trainee who was performing an exercise for the first time.  -- lack of control of the parameters (speed) by the crew.   - A second phase that lead to the loss of the aircraft and part of its crew. It resulte from an underestimation of the damage to the aircraft during the impact with the water and from the decision of the captain to take off without checking the flight controls.   It is common practice for crews to continue flying loss of a float during a scoop. The instructor assimilated the circumstances of the float loss he was confronted with to those already encountered during scooping operations. He proceeded with the takeoff without checking the flight controls that were damaged during the stall.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEAD Report number: BEAD-air-S-2004-006-A Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Air Forces Monthly, May 2004   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The nose wheel steering was inoperative and had been deferred in accordance with the operator's Minimum Equipment List (MEL).  In that situation, the nose wheel was in the ""free castor mode.""  The MEL states that directional control is to be maintained by using brakes and differential power.  The pilot reported that the landing touch down was on the centerline, however, shortly afterward the aircraft encountered an ""overwhelming"" wind gust which caused it to weathervane to the left.  He reported that he applied full right rudder and differential right braking which was effective in stopping the aircraft's drift.  However, the aircraft encountered a second ""much stronger and sustained"" gust, which caused the aircraft to ""veer strongly to the left.""  His subsequent efforts to maintain directional control through the use of differential braking and differential engine thrust were insufficient to keep the aircraft from departing the runway pavement.  The aircraft came to rest in the soft grass adjacent to the runway.  The pilot attempted to taxi back onto the runway, however, the nose wheel contacted the edge of the pavement and collapsed.  Distinct ruts were observed in the soft turf adjacent to the left side of the runway.  The nose wheel tire track approached the edge of the pavement at approximately a 20-degree angle and terminated at the edge of the runway.  The track was approximately eight inches deep relative to the level of the runway pavement.  The published maximum demonstrated crosswind component for the aircraft was 22 knots.  The operator did not impose a crosswind component limitation on operations in general or on operations with the nose wheel steering inoperative under the MEL.  Surface winds provided to the flight crew by the control tower were 310 degrees at 23 knots, gusting to 30 knots. Probable Cause: The captain's improper decision due to his attempt to taxi back onto the runway after coming to a stop in the grass, and the resulting collapse of nose landing gear.  Contributing factors were the inoperative nose wheel steering, the pilot's inability to maintain directional control during the landing roll due to the crosswind, and the high crosswind component.  Additional factors were the uneven transition between the grass and the runway pavement, as well as the soft grass.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CHI04LA086 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: NTSB: https://www.ntsb.gov/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/brief.aspx?ev_id=20040319X00351&key=1  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates23-Feb-2015 14:52 Noro Added 21-Dec-2016 19:28 ASN Update Bot Updated [Time, Damage, Category, Investigating agency, ]07-Dec-2017 17:48 ASN Update Bot Updated [Operator, Other fatalities, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

It departed at 03:43 for Tonopah. After reporting the runway lights in sight, the pilot configured the airplane for the approach and initiated a circling maneuver to the right for a visual straight-in approach to runway 32. During the turn the pilot suffered a sudden cardiac death. Half way through the turn the airplane began a gradual descent until it impacted the ground. The airplane broke up and burst into flames. Investigation revealed that the pilot had violated federal policy and directives, wilfully deceived flight medical examiners, suppressed significant medical information and ingested inappropriate medications for a deteriorating and dangerous health condition. The pilot had high blood pressure and failed to report it, and denied taking medications to his Federal Aviation Administration flight physical examiners. According to the Air Force Materiel Command Accident Investigation Board report, the pilot became incapacitated during his approach to land due to sudden cardiac death.Sources: AFMC News Service Release 0743  Executive Summary Beechcraft 1900C, UB37, N27RA accident  (USAF)  Las Vegas Review-Journal   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

The flight continued to Darwin with the landing gear extended. During approach to Darwin airport the pilot advised air traffic control that he could not obtain a green 'down and locked' indication for the left main landing gear, and declared an emergency prior to landing. During touchdown, the left main landing gear collapsed and the aircraft slewed off the runway. Both occupants evacuated the aircraft with no injuries. The aircraft operator's maintenance organisation examined the aircraft and found that the left main landing gear drive shaft had severed as a result of fretting against a bleed air duct clamp tail. The bleed air duct clamp (jubilee clamp) had been fitted to the aircraft during an aircraft refurbishment program in September 2003. The jubilee clamp tail had been fastened in close proximity to the landing gear drive shaft. Subsequently, the jubilee clamp tail had come into close contact with the drive shaft, leading to severe wear of the drive shaft section and eventual failure.Sources: ATSB   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot attempted to re-cycle the landing gear but without success; later he noticed that he also had indications of LIFT DUMP FAIL and ANTI SKID FAIL. He diverted to Farnborough. After touchdown the pilot attempted to deploy the lift dump system but, as expected, the lift dump spoilers failed to extend. After discussing the problem with the aircraft's maintenance organisation, the aircraft was flown to Blackbushe for further technical investigation. After landing on runway 26 (4400 feet long) the aircraft left the runway, struck a series of obstructions and was destroyed. The support bracket for the right main landing gear weight-on-wheels switch was found to have sustained a pre-impact failure which accounted for the indications reported by the pilot.Sources: AAIB Bulletin 1/2005   Location  Images: photo (c) aeroprints.com; Rantoul, KS; 30 April 2013; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

After landing uneventfully at their destination airport, the crewmembers observed that the number two right engine cowling had separated and struck the right inboard elevator.  Inspection of the airplane revealed that the engine cowling upper forward hinge required three bolts.  However, only one bolt remained attached, and there was no evidence that the other two bolts tore away during flight.  Fretting was observed in the area of the bolt holes, consistent with an oscillation over a period of time, due to the absence of two bolts.  The airliner maintenance manual required a general inspection of the area, but did not specifically mention cowling hinge bolts.  In addition, the hinges were located in an area that was not easily accessible to maintenance personnel. Probable Cause: The failure of the number two upper forward right engine cowling attachment, which resulted in substantial damage to the right inboard elevator.

Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed. The commercial-rated pilot received minor injuries, and one passenger received serious injuries, and the airplane was destroyed. The flight originated at Stuart-Witham Field, FL (SUA) the same day, about 18:45. The pilot stated that he initiated a fuel transfer due to a fuel imbalance. To affect the fuel transfer, he said he ""began crossfeed right to left."" When the airplane was about 5 to 10 miles away from Spruce Creek Airport, the pilot said he began his descent from 12,500, and also executed a left turn to begin setting up to land, when suddenly, both engines ceased operating. When he levelled the wings both engines restarted due to auto-ignition. He said the fuel gages showed 300 to 350 lb of fuel for the right tank, and 100 to 150 pounds on the left, so he decided to continue his approach to Spruce Creek Airport. As he approached Spruce Creek Airport, he again entered a left bank to prepare for a left base to runway 23, and while established in the left turn, both engines ceased operating a second time. He said he did not think he could reach the runway, and decided to make an landing on a taxiway. When the wings became level after the turn, he said both engines again restarted while in the vicinity of the beginning of the taxiway. As he was about to land, he said a car pulled out onto the taxiway, and stopped on the centerline, so he applied power to avoid the car. He said he climbed straight out, and when he made a climbing left turn, he said the engines ceased operating a third time, and the airplane descended towards a cluster of condos. With no runway or clear area in sight, the pilot said he guided the airplane to a retention pond. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The pilot's inadequate management of the airplane's fuel system, which resulted in fuel starvation, a loss of engine power, a forced landing, and damage to the airplane during the landing.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: MIA04LA071 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The co-pilot was at the controls and was flying a non-precision approach for runway 05. The pilot-in-command took the controls less than one mile from the runway threshold and saw the runway when they were over the threshold. At approximately 10:18 the wheels touched down approximately 1500 feet from the end of runway 05. The pilot-in-command realized that the remaining landing distance was insufficient. He told the co-pilot to retract the flaps and applied full power, but did not reveal his intentions. The co-pilot cut power, selected reverse pitch and applied full braking. The aircraft continued rolling through the runway end, sank into the gravel and snow, and stopped abruptly about 500 feet past the runway end. The aircraft was severely damaged. None of the occupants were injured. FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1. The aircraft was positioned over the runway threshold at an altitude that did not allow a landing at the beginning of the runway, and this, combined with a tailwind component and the wet runway surface, resulted in a runway excursion. 2. Failure to follow standard operating procedures and a lack of crew coordination contributed to confusion on landing, which prevented the crew from aborting the landing and executing a missed approach. 3. The pilot-in-command held several management positions within the company and controlled the pilot hiring and dismissal policies. This situation, combined with the level of experience of the co-pilot compared with that of the pilot-in-command, had an impact on crew cohesiveness.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A04Q0049 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: TSB   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The next flight was to Trieste (TRS); the copilot was the pilot flying on this leg. The airplane departed at 08:47. The MD-82 landed at Trieste's runway 09 after an uneventful flight. The crew were cleared to taxi to the ramp and took taxiway Bravo, which was the first taxiway to the right. With the sun in front the view of the crew was bit hampered. At the last moment the captain noticed a vehicle to his right hand side. He steered to the left to avoid it, but the truck impacted the right wing. The outer part of the wing (3,5 m/ca. 11 feet) was almost completely sheared off. The fuel tank ruptured, causing a fuel spill on the taxiway. After noticing the spill, the crew ordered an emergency evacuation of the airplane. The evacuation was initiated one minute and 20 seconds after the collision. One minute and 24 seconds later, the fire brigade had reached the scene. It appeared that construction works were in progress near taxiway Bravo. A Notam was not issued about this and the tower controller had not informed the crew either. CAUSES (translated from Italian): The analysis of the technical, operational and organizational context in which the event took place (impact of the end of the right wing of the aircraft, during taxiing, against the rear body of a truck that was parked for work within the protection area of the taxiway that leads from the BRAVO connection to the parking area) has allowed to determine the following causes, which are attributable to human and environmental factors. - Failure to close the BRAVO taxiway with the issue of the relative NOTAM of the works in progress. - Failure of the Torre control to provide the pilots with essential information on the condition of the airport, as provided for by ICAO in ICAO Doc. 4444 PANS-ATM. - Vertical and horizontal ground signs do not correspond to those specified in ICAO Annex 14. - Failure to comply with the ENAC circular (APT-11), applicable for the type of work in progress at the airport. - Insufficient surveillance of the airport area affected by the works by ENAC and the airport management company Aeroporto FVG. - Lack of an airport Safety Management System . - Inadequate surveillance of the external space during taxiing by the flight crew, resulting in incorrect assessment of the position of the aircraft with respect to the obstacle.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ANSV Report number: A/9/05 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: ANSV   Location  Images: photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Roma-Fiumicino Airport (FCO); 16 June 2001 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The operating hours of the only airport nearby, Melo, are from 07:00 hrs to 19:00 hrs, so it was closed. Montevideo ACC contacted the airport guard who switched on the runway lights and reported the emergency to fire fighters and police located in the city. The aircraft found the runway lights and landed on runway 07. Touchdown took place 340 m from the threshold. The F-27 stopped 640 m after touchdown. The crew evacuated through the cockpit windows, due to the intense heat and smoke in the cargo area. Ten minutes after landing, the fire fighters arrived and succeeded in extinguishing the fire. The airplane suffered considerable damage in the cargo compartments E and F. PROBABLE CAUSE (translated from Spanish): Numerous oil samples, plant tissues, and several animals that were transported, would have reacted on contact with an exothermic chemical reaction and associated combustion. The event originated with the spilling of liquid from containers not suitable for differential pressure, with little excess capacity for expansion and filled with indiscriminate materials. Low stringency in filling forms for description of product delivered for shipment in company offices and little control or careless handling of the load would have contributed to the occurrence of the accident.Sources: ICAO Adrep  NTSB  Images: photo (c) Jose Maria Techera; Melo Airport (MLZ/SUMO); 02 August 2015 photo (c) Elliot Greenman, via Werner Fischdick; Pittsburgh International Airport, PA (PIT/KPIT) [N]; May 1990 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The three pilots and five mechanics escaped unhurt. The airplane was attached to the Escadron de Transport Outre-Mer 58 (ETOM 00.058) and was being prepared for a test flight. Shortly after start-up, just as the airplane has commenced taxiing towards the runway, a fire erupted. The airplane was stopped immediately. Three minutes later the fire services arrived and extinguished the fire. The airplane sustained serious damage to the left wing, left hand fuselage and tail section. CAUSES:  The accident was caused by electrical arcing at the power cable to a submersible fuel pump. This arcing occured above the kerosene liquid inside the tank full of fuel vapors. The cable type used was chosen at the time of the design of the aircraft. Atmospheric conditions on the apron of Fort de France have raised the temperature of the reservoir beyond the flash point kerosene. The vapors contained in this tank were explosive, and the arc was enough to initiate the blast. As such, atmospheric conditions are a certain cause of environmental origin of the accident. The appearance of the arc is, in turn, has only technical causes: - The quality of cable used and age are in fact responsible for the creation of the electric arc. - The formation of the insulating sheath of this type of cable is not likely to ensure an absolute seal. This quality is also not claimed by its manufacturer. Indeed, the analyzes carried out show a porosity of electrical cable, even nine, therefore that it is soaked in kerosene. The presence of kerosene increases the phenomenon of porosity of old cables. Degradation characteristics of dielectric strength of the cable insulation explains the appearance of the arc. The accident occurred while the cable was over 19 years old. The fuel pumps wiring has never been a problem. But there has not been a cable that had reached the age of 19 years. The aging of the cable could still degrade the seal. Finally, maintaining this type of cable on the first C160 series until this accident was part of a complex process in which traceability has not been formally established. Doubts indeed appeared in 1969 on the quality of these cables, doubts that can be considered today as precursors. Measures had been adopted precisely to overcome these deficiencies.  In this regard, the replacement of the fuel pump wiring of the second series C 160 of these cables with a newer type and considered more efficient is particularly significant. Its extension to the first series aircraft might have seemed relevant, and would probably have prevented the accident. The reasons which led to the maintenance of such cables on the C 160 series first held in both the human factor (underestimation of risk, lack of global view on the issue) and organizational factors, which can be seen as a lack of traceability of technical and logistic actions, a lack of consistency of the measures adopted, and probable deficiencies in the information flow.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEAD Report number: BEAD-A-2004-012-A Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: Scramble 321   Location  Images: photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Mildenhall RAF Station (MHZ); August 1990 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Following the startup of the engines, an explosion occurred in the left wing area aft of the number 1 engine firewall and number 1 auxiliary fuel tank.  The airplane was parked next to the mine's fuel storage tank, and the pilot added power on the remaining engines to move away from the storage tank.  Within seconds of beginning to move, the number 1 engine fell off the burning wing, followed by separation and aft folding of the outboard end of the left wing.  The outboard end of the wing, however, was still attached via control cables.  The pilot taxied the airplane about 200 feet, dragging the partially burning left wing segment to a pond of water and shut down the remaining engines. The crew evacuated with no injuries.  Water was applied to the airplane until the fire was extinguished, about 3 1/2 hours later.  NTSB and FAA personnel did not travel to the scene, and the airplane was not recovered from the mining strip.  The airplane's left wing powerplant and fuel system consists of the number 1 and 2 engines.  Each engine is separated from the wing by a firewall.  Within the wing, from outboard to inboard, the fuel tank system consists of the number 1 fuel tank, the left wing auxiliary fuel tank, and the number 2 fuel tank.  Each wet-wing type fuel tank contains a submerged electrical boost pump, sump drain valves and fuel quantity transmitters.  The fuel system has selector valves, crossfeed valves, and shut-off valves for each tank.  An FAA inspector examined portions of the airplane that the operator supplied.  The inspector examined a portion of the upper wing surface that had been blown away from the airplane during the initial explosion.  He noted that the inside of the upper wing surface, normally positioned over the auxiliary tank, was not charred or sooted.  A separated portion of the lower wing surface, near the auxiliary boost pump, was sooted and charred.  The aft side of the number 1 engine firewall was not charred.  A portion of the number 1 engine nacelle was oily, but not sooted or charred.  The operator located the auxiliary in-tank boost pump and sent it to the FAA.

The captain was the nonflying pilot for the flight, and the first officer was the flying pilot. The takeoff, climb, and en route portions of the flight were uneventful. At 14:37, as the flight approached the San Juan traffic area, the ATIS reported that winds were 060 degrees at 17 knots and gusting at 23 knots. Shortly thereafter, the captain briefed a Vref (the minimum approach airspeed in the landing configuration before the airplane reaches the runway threshold) of 95 knots and told the first officer to ""stand by for winds."" At 14:43 SJU Terminal Radar Approach Control cautioned the pilots of possible wake turbulence from a preceding Boeing. The captain told the first officer to slow down to about 140 kts. At 14:46, the local controller cleared the airplane to land on runway 08. The first officer turned the airplane left toward runway 08 and transitioned to the visual approach slope indicator. At 14:49, the captain stated, ""you better keep that nose down or get some power up because you're gonna balloon."" The airplane descended below the glideslope, causing a GPWS ""glideslope"" alert. The airplane was about 45 feet above ground level and traveling at 110 knots indicated airspeed when it crossed the runway 08 threshold. After the airplane crossed the runway threshold, the captain stated, ""power in a little bit, don't pull the nose up, don't pull the nose up."" At 14:49:39, the captain stated, ""you're ballooning,"" and the first officer replied, ""all right.""  The airplane touched down for the first time about 14:49:41 and about 1,600 feet beyond the runway 08 threshold with vertical and lateral loads of about 1.3 Gs and -0.10 G, respectively. Upon touchdown the captain stated, ""get the power,"" and, 1 second later, ""my aircraft."" The first officer responded, ""your airplane."" The airplane had skipped to an altitude of about 4 feet and touched down again two seconds later about 2,200 feet beyond the runway 08 threshold. The airplane then pitched up to an angle of 9Â° while climbing to an altitude of 37 feet and the engine torque increased from 10 to 43 percent. About 14:49:49, the pitch angle decreased to -3Â°, and the engine torque started to decrease to 20 percent with the pitch angle decreasing to -10Â°. The airplane touched down a third time about 14:49:51 at a bank angle of 7Â° left wing down and about 3,300 feet beyond the runway 08 threshold and with vertical and lateral loads of about 5 Gs and 0.85 G. The ATR pitched up again to 24 feet and landed a fourth time about 14:49:56 (about 15 seconds after the initial touchdown) and about 4,000 feet beyond the runway 08 threshold. This time the airplane pitched down to -7Â° and that it was banked 29Â° left wing down. The airplane came to a complete stop on a grassy area about 217 feet left of the runway centerline and about 4,317 feet beyond the runway threshold. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the captainÂs failure to execute proper techniques to recover from the bounced landings and his subsequent failure to execute a go-around.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NTSB/AAR-05-02 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  14 June 1997 N438AT Simmons Airlines 0 Dallas, TX min Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; San Juan-Luis Munoz Marin International Airport (SJU); May 2004; (publicdomain) photo (c) Pedro de la Cruz via Werner Fischdick; Puerto Plata-La Union Airport (POP); August 2002 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Each time 9018 kgs of fuel was uplifted in El Obeid while the average fuel consumption for a round trip was 10000 kgs. On the second round trip on May 11, on the leg back to El Obeid, 4201 kgs of fuel remained. The flight departed at 11:40 UTC and climbed to the cruising altitude of FL240. En route all four engines flamed out as a result of a lack of fuel. The propellers were feathered and the aircraft was prepared for a forced landing. The aircraft hit the ground with its nose first and bounced for 15 meters until it collided with trees. Due to high impact force and high rate of descent the wings were twisted. The cockpit section was compressed within the central cargo compartment and a small fire erupted, likely due to electrical shortage within the electrical equipment. There were no survivors. The crew was composed of an Armenian captain and ground engineer, a Sudanese first officer, a Sudanese navigator, a Sudanese radio operator, an Iraqi navigator and an Iraqi flight engineer. The investigation showed that the Sudanese navigator license was expired since July 2001. The Iraqi crew members did not have any valid licenses and their experience on the An-12 dated back from 1994. The aircraft's Certificate of Release to Service and Certificate of Maintenance Review both expired on April 30, 2004. Cause of Accident a) Fuel starvation due to Company fuel planning policy. b) The exhaustion of the Captain as he was handling all flights during the three days preceding the accident flight in addition to the weather on day of accident. c) Some of the crew members had limited experience on the type and three of them even did not fly on AN-12 for a long time which might aggravate the situation before the crash.Sources: akhbaralyoumsd.com  Aviation Letter 451  ICAO Adrep   Location  Images: photo (c) AviaNet Images (www.avianet.de), via Werner Fischdick; Sharjah Airport (SHJ); December 2003 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

During the descent at 1105Z and approximately 1nm from joining overhead the aerodrome for landing on Runway 18 at Phinda Aerodrome, the pilot observed a bird just in front and slightly above the aircraft. He then shouted 'bird'? but at that moment the bird impacted and shattered the co-pilot's windshield. The pilot-in-command immediately took control of the aircraft in order to assess the damage sustained by the bird strike and also the controllability of the aircraft as the co-pilot was dazed and bleeding from his head. The pilot-in-command immediately called Mayday and turned onto left downwind with the aircraft yawing to the right with a loss of airspeed. At that stage, he experienced difficulty in turning the aircraft to the left and required additional power in order to maintain airspeed and rudder input to maintain runway heading. The aircraft landed safely with only a slight bounce. The co-pilot's windshield was found completely shattered, the right-hand wing leading edge was dented at the wing root, headliner and cabin panels broken and seats and interior soiled. The co- pilot sustained facial cuts and bruises and 2 passengers sustained facial cuts. The last MPI was certified on 12 February 2004 at a total of 2950.4 hours. The aircraft had flown an addition of 70.9 hours since the MPI was certified. The pilot was in possession of a valid Commercial pilot's license no. 437925, issued by the Licence Authority of Australia and South African validation, J6/15/1/6431 at the time of the accident. The Operator was in possession of a valid Air Operating Certificate No CAA N142D that was issued on 18 December 2003 and valid until 17 December 2004.

According to the captain, the right wing was bent up 10 to 20 degrees 3 to 4 feet inboard of the wingtip.  When the accident occurred, the airplane was turning left from a magnetic heading of approximately 210 degrees to a heading of approximately 120 degrees.  The captain estimated the wind was from 110 degrees (magnetic) at 35 knots gusting 40 knots.  The Automated Weather Observing Station (AWOS) at the airport reported winds from 150 degrees (true) at 39 knots gusting 48 knots. Probable Cause: The captain's improper evaluation of the weather conditions and improper decision to taxi the airplane in high gusting wind conditions which resulted in the airplane's right wing striking the ground.

The pilot stated that he was high and fast during the descent into Las Vegas but that the approach was ""stable"" by 500 feet. He stated that he maintained his Vref speed of 112 knots from there until touchdown.  The passenger stated that he felt that the approach was ""fast"" and that the pilot was ""behind the power curve"" because of high minimum enroute altitudes in the area and that they had to ""hustle down"" during the descent. The passenger indicated that the flight crossed the runway threshold ""maybe a bit more"" that 10 knots above Vref and touched down about 10 knots above Vref. He said it was not a stabilized approach. Landing distance calculations and other evidence suggest that the lift dump panels did not extend after landing; however, the investigation did not determine the reason(s) for the lack of lift dump. No evidence was found of any failures affecting the lift dump or braking systems. Evidence and interview statements reveal that the pilot flew an unstabilized approach to the runway and landed well above target speed. The high landing speed was result of the pilot's excessive airspeed on the approach and a tailwind component of about 8 knots. Although the pilot landed the airplane within the touchdown area, the airplane's speed upon touchdown was about 17 knots above the prescribed speed. After exiting the end of runway 7, the airplane continued and impacted a perimeter fence and came to rest approximately 735 feet beyond the end of runway. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The flight's unstabilized approach and excessive speed. Contributing to the excessive touchdown speed was the presence of a tailwind at landing.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA04MA049 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

It was carrying one pilot and nine passengers. The takeoff, climb out and the initial phase of the flight were normal. About 20 minutes into the flight at FL125 (12500 feet amsl) when the pilot had already made a power reduction and was in the process of trimming the aircraft for level flight, a loud bang was heard that was accompanied by a loss of engine power. The pilot immediately switched on the ignition to no avail. He set the power lever to IDLE, at the same time checking the Ng, which read 0%. The indications from other instruments and the annunciator panel showed that the engine was not running. Efforts to restart the engine failed and the pilot took advantage of the high altitude to circle around in order to find a convenient field for executing a forced landing. The pilot subsequently located a Masai steppe overlooking Loiborsoit village in Simanjiro. After briefing the passengers about the imminent forced landing the pilot made a touch down on a grass field. After rolling for about 400 meters 5H-AXL ran into a terraced field from which maize had been harvested. Tire marks on the ground indicated that it was here that the nose landing gear struck raised lip of earth and sheared from its fuselage attachment point. It subsequently penetrated into the forward baggage pod compartment. The aircraft came to rest some 480 meters beyond the point of initial touch down. The pilot opened the cockpit door and all passengers disembarked safely. There was no fire and there were no injuries.  The aircraft sustained damage to its nose landing gear which separated and the propeller, whose two blades were bent. One of the tubular members of the engine bearer frame was bent and the baggage pod was damaged when it scraped the ground. CAUSE(S): The accident was caused by the aircraft stalling and crashing whilst trying to avoid a truck on the road. The attempt to land on the road was necessitated by the loss of power arising from the engine CT blade(s) failure in flight. The cause of the CT blade(s) failure could not be determined due to severe overheating and impact damage to the blade airfoils. The failure of the pilot to see the landing sight clearly through the wind screen due to the splash of engine oil on the wind screen was a major contributory factor.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIB Tanzania Report number: ACC/14/04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: 2004 Air Accidents / Incidents (Tanzania CAA, AIB)  NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) Eric Groot; Zanzibar-Kisauni Airport (ZNZ/HTZA); 11 August 2011 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

At an height below 100 feet during the final approach, the aircraft was caught by windshear. The flight crew initiated a missed approach procedure during which the tail of the aircraft struck the runway. The aircraft circled and landed safely at 10:31 hours. PROBABLE CAUSE (translated from Italian): A probable and sudden variability in wind direction and intensity (wind shear phenomenon), which occurred below 100 feet, resulteded in a reduction in aircraft speed, which was only partially compensated by the crew. This was followed by a missed approach procedure, during which the rear part of the aircraft impacted the runway, causing damage to the structure of the fuselage. A contributing factor was that the approach was made below the intended path and a late execution of the missed approach manoeuvre.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ANSV Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  22 January 2019 VH-NJZ National Jet Express 0 Sydney-Kingsford Smith International Airport, NSW (SYD/YSSY) non Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were 163 passengers and six crew members on board. Three passengers were slightly injured. JAS Flight 979 took off from Kagoshima Airport at 15:35 and flew to Tokunoshima Airport. On landing at Tokunoshima Airport runway 01, the aircraft's left main landing gear (MLG) collapsed during rollout and its left wing tip contacted the ground. The aircraft came to a stop on the runway. PROBABLE CAUSE: In this accident, it is estimated that due to the left main landing gear cylinder collapsed immediately after the aircraft landed at Tokunoshima Airport, the fuselage inclined to the left and the aircraft traveled with its left wing in contact with the runway surface, resulting substantial damage.  With respect to the collapse of the MLG cylinder, it is considered that Gear Walks which experienced before the restrictor was installed generated large stresses on the fuse section of the cylinder surface and caused micro cracks. The micro cracks are considered to grow during normal operation and eventually lead to the fracture.  Further, it is considered that the presence of surface flaw on the cylinder caused by grit-blast contributed to the crack generation. And the contributing factor to the fact that the company could not detect the cracks on the cylinder by the scheduled maintenance, etc. is considered to be that the manufacturer had not established appropriate inspection intervals or inspection times to detect fatigue cracking.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ARAIC Report number: AA2006-3 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Yomiuri   Location  Images: photo (c) JTSB; Tokunoshima Airport (TKN/RJKN); January 2004 photo (c) JTSB; Tokunoshima Airport (TKN/RJKN); January 2004 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

On board were 135, mostly French, holidaymakers who were heading home.  At 04:38 the flight was cleared to taxi to runway 22R for departure. After takeoff, at 04:42, the plane climbed and maneuvered for a procedural left turn to intercept the 306 radial from the Sharm el-Sheikh VOR station. When the autopilot was engaged the captain made an exclamation and the autopilot was immediately switched off again. The captain then requested Heading Select to be engaged. The plane then began to bank to the right. The copilot then warned the captain a few times about the fact that the bank angle was increasing. At a bank angle of 40 degrees to the right the captain stated ""OK come out"". The ailerons returned briefly to neutral before additional aileron movements commanded an increase in the right bank. The aircraft had reached a maximum altitude of 5460 feet with a 50 degrees bank when the copilot stated: ""Overbank"". Repeating himself as the bank angle kept increasing. The maximum bank angle recorded was 111 degrees right. Pitch attitude at that time was 43 degrees nose down and altitude was 3470 feet. The observer on the flight deck, a trainee copilot, called ""Retard power, retard power, retard power"". Both throttles were moved to idle and the airplane gently seemed to recover from the nose-down, right bank attitude. Speed however increased, causing an overspeed warning. At 04:45 the airplane struck the surface of the water in a 24 degrees right bank, 24 degrees nose-down, at a speed of 416 kts and with a 3,9 G load. The wreckage sank to a depth of approx. 900 metres. CONCLUSION: ""No conclusive evidence could be found from the findings gathered through this investigation to determine the probable cause. However, based on the work done, it could be concluded that any combination of these findings could have caused or contributed to the accident.  Although the crew at the last stage of this accident attempted to correctly recover, the gravity upset condition with regards to attitude, altitude and speed made this attempt insufficient to achieve a successful recovery.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ECAA Report number: Report su-f040103a Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   AFP  BEA  Reuters   Location  Images: photo (c) Frank Ellemers; Sharm el Sheikh; 20 April 2012 photo (c) JosÃ© RamÃ³n Valero; Madrid-Barajas Airport (MAD); 08 August 2003 photo (c) Panagiotis A.

A few minutes before 8 o'clock in the morning the crew were cleared to descend from FL280 to FL100. The ice detection system was triggered during descent to FL100. Engine and airframe anti-icing systems were switched on simultaneously. FL100 was reached at 07:59:58 hrs. The pilots stated that they encountered icing conditions when the airplane entered the clouds. At FL100 ice is reported to have formed at the windscreen edges. Vibrations on the no. 2 engine increased temporarily after a flight time of six minutes at FL100. As the airplane was approximately 12.5 NM south of Munich airport, the crew was instructed to descend to FL90 and to change heading to 020 degrees. Heavy vibrations on the no. 2 engine occurred during descent. According to crew statements, the airbrakes were extended in order to increase thrust setting on the engines without increase in airspeed. Immediately afterwards the warning VIB HIGH ENG2 was triggered at FL90. The actions of the Abnormal Procedure Vibration High checklist were carried out. However, the no. 2 engine was not shut down for lack of other failure indications. Afterwards no more problems for the no. 2 engine were indicated. Simultaneously with the strong vibrations, vibrations and noises from the rear cabin area were heard in the cockpit. At 08:08:14 hrs the EPR of the no. 1 engine dropped from 1.5 to 1.1 and stayed at about 1.0 after that. In the cockpit heavy vibrations had been noticed also and a rattling noise had been heard. But the vibrations were not displayed on the multifunctional display as originating from the engines. At 08:08:22 hrs, the captain declared an emergency because of severe engine problems and requested an immediate landing. The airplane was immediately cleared to descend to 5,000 ft based on a QNH of 1,017 hPa and to change to a heading of 080 degrees. The crew requested an approach as short as possible. While leaving FL90, the EPR of the no. 1 engine dropped also from 1.4 to 1.0 within the next four minutes; this EPR reduction was incremental and occurred independent of the thrust setting. At 7,000 ft the air brakes were extended for a short time and engine thrust increased. During the descent to 5,000 ft the airplane was transferred to Munich Director. After 08:12:45 hrs when the airplane had reached approximately 5,000 ft the EPR of the no. 2 engine retained values of about 1.0 also. Munich Director immediately issued a clearance to further descend to 3,500 ft. The air brakes where extended again for a period of 44 seconds. Thereby the airspeed was reduced to approximately 170 kt. With the landing gears extended and the flaps set to 15 degrees, the airspeed was about 150 kt. The airplane was guided to the landing course of the ILS 26L approximately 8 NM in front of the threshold. At approximately 4,000 ft flaps were extended to 25 degrees. After the airplane had descended in landing configuration to the cleared altitude of 3,500 ft and horizontal flight had been established, the crew noticed that by pushing the thrust levers forward, the EPR on both engines did not increase to the required value. The speeds N1 and N2 and the exhaust gas temperatures (EGT) of both engines increased, the EPRs, however, remained at values of around 1.0. After the message of the crew that they were just approaching the ILS the flight was transferred to Munich Tower. Airspeed decreased to approximately 115 kt. The autopilot was immediately switched off, the airplane again established in descent, the flaps reset to 15 degrees and the landing gears retracted. Airspeed increased to approximately 135 kt. The flaps were again set to 25 degrees. The airplane received clearance to land. At 08:16:10 hrs the controller informed the crew that the Fokker was approximately 500 ft below the glide path. At this time the height measured by the radio altimeter was 500 ft AGL. At the same time the GPWS sounded: ""Too low"" and ""Gear"". The crew informed the controller that the runway could not be reached and that the landing would take place approximately 4 NM short of the runway: ""...We will not make it...to the runway...we are touching down probable 4 Miles before the field...""). From approximately 400 ft AGL downwards the airplane was clear of clouds. The landing gear was selected down 13 seconds prior to ground contact. The captain informed the cabin crew of the imminent emergency landing through the repeated exclamation ""Brace for impact"" 5 seconds prior to touch down. At 08:16:35 hrs, the airplane touched down on a snow covered field approximately 2.5 NM short of the runway with landing gears partly extended and came to rest severely damaged lying on the fuselage after a sliding distance of 220 m. All occupants left the airplane without assistance via the forward passenger door exit. The accident was due to the following immediate causes: - After a prolonged time under moderate icing conditions and low engine thrust, ice developed on the rotors of the low pressure compressors of both engines. - The bonded joints of the ice impact panels on both engines failed due to strains caused by ice-induced vibrations of the engines and by ice which had shedded from the rotors of the low pressure compressor. - The loose ice impact panels became trapped in front of the outlet guide vanes of the low pressure compressor and affected the airflow in the by-pass duct in such a way that the engines now only produced low thrust. - The runway was no longer within reach of the aircraft as the loss of thrust on both engines had not triggered any warnings and was not indicated until the necessary demand of thrust at an altitude of 3,500 ft. - Due to its nature the terrain within reach was not suited for the landing of a transport airplane.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BFU Report number: BFU AX001-0/04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   Austrian Airlines  BFU History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  26 March 2024 5Y-MMB unknown 0 Nairobi-Wilson Airport (WIL/HKNW) non Taxiway excursion Images: photo (c) Vuxi; near MÃ¼nchen; January 2004; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) Werner Fischdick; DÃ¼sseldorf Airport (DUS); 28 September 2002 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

This caused the aircraft to pivot so that it's nose went through the hangar door before it came to a stop. The crew reported that as they were making a left turn, nose-wheel steering became insufficient as the turn tightened. To compensate, a small amount of brake pressure was was applied on the left wheel. The captain felt that this amount of braking was inadequate, so maximum brake pressure was applied on the left wheel. This had no effect, resulting in the collision with the hangar. The emergency braking system was not used. Of the two crew and six passengers, three of the passengers reported neck problems. Upon investigation, no defects were found in the braking system, and it is unknown whether the antilock braking system activated during the event. According to the aircraft manufacturer, it is possible that the degraded turn performance was a result of the left wheel locking up. The surface was wet from rainfall, and the tight left turn would reduce weight on the left wheel. Both of these factors decrease traction, increasing the likelihood of the left wheel locking up. Although it was not determined if the brakes were tested before commencing the taxi, the Dutch Safety Board reccomended that testing of the brakes always be carried out before taxiing. This gives an earlier opportunity for the crew to activate the emergency braking system.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Dutch Safety Board Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: Dutch Safety Board Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates25-Sep-2020 15:13 ASN Update Bot Added 25-May-2022 05:29 harro Updated [Total fatalities, Other fatalities, Damage, ]13-Jun-2022 20:22 Ron Averes Updated [Location, ]12-Oct-2024 14:52 Justanormalperson Updated [Operator, Destination airport, ] Corrections or additions? ...

Weather was poor as the flight approached the airport. After reporting capturing the glideslope the air traffic controller reported a vertical visibility of 60 m and a runway visual range of 1300 m. About 12,5 km out, the aircraft's rate of descent increased, causing it to descend below the glideslope. The rate of descent was arrested at a height of 170 m, 8 km from the threshold of runway 08L and they continued in level flight. At the Outer Marker (3,5 km from the runway) they should have started their initial approach, but the crew continued level flight thus flying above the glideslope now. With 2,5 km to go the airplane descended slightly at 1-1,5 m/sec. At the Inner Marker the descent rate increased to 2-2,6 m/sec. The crew then probably saw the runway lights below them. The engines were brought back to idle and reverse thrust was applied at a height of 60 m. When it appeared that they would not be able to land given the remaining runway length, reverse thrust was deselected and engine power was increased. At that point the airplane touched down 260 m past the end of the runway. It continued until the right wing struck a concrete building. The plane then lost the left wing before it crashed through a concrete wall. The airplane broke up, crashed into a ditch and caught fire.METAR: 14:00 UTC / 19:00 local time: UTTT 131400Z 23003MPS 180V250 0350 R08L/0900N FG VV001 01/01 Q1026 TEMPO 0200 FG VV001 08CLRD70=15:00 UTC / 20:00 local time: UTTT 131500Z 22002MPS 0200 R08L/0600N FG VV001 01/01 Q1026 NOSIG 08CLRD70= Sources: ITAR-TASS  NTV  Russian Ministry of Transport letter 02.04.2004 No. 22.15-412  RIA Novosti   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

At 15:55, the aircraft was de-iced and departed ten minutes later. The aircraft landed at 16:20. While on the ramp, two individuals voiced concern to the pilot that there was ice on the wing. Freezing precipitation was falling. The pilot was observed to visually check the leading edge of the wing; however, he did not voice any concern and proceeded with loading the passengers and cargo. At approximately 16:38, flight GGN126 departed Pelee Island for Windsor. After using most of the runway length for takeoff, the aircraft climbed out at a very shallow angle. The pilot raised the flaps while over Lake Erie. The Caravan then entered an aerodynamic stall. Because the plane was rolling into a climbing right turn, the left wing stalled first. The nose dropped and the airplane rolled to the left. The airplane was too low for recovery and struck the ice. It was determined that the aircraft was overweight by 1270 pounds (576 kg) when it departed Pelee Island. The maximum takeoff weight for this flight was 8550 pounds (3878 kg). FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1. At take-off, the weight of the aircraft exceeded the maximum allowable gross take-off weight by at least 15 per cent, and the aircraft was contaminated with ice. Therefore, the aircraft was being flown significantly outside the limitations under which it was certified for safe flight. 2. The aircraft stalled, most likely when the flaps were retracted, at an altitude or under flight conditions that precluded recovery before it struck the ice surface of the lake. 3. On this flight, the pilot's lack of appreciation for the known hazards associated with the overweight condition of the aircraft, ice contamination, and the weather conditions was inconsistent with his previous practices. His decision to take off was likely adversely affected by some combination of stress and fatigue.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A04H0001 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   TSB  Transport Canada   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

While the aircraft was traveling along taxiway NG, just before arriving abeam apron D, a blow was felt coming from the front left of the aircraft. The blow had been produced by the collision with a passenger bus, which had invaded the taxiway along a rolling road that crossed taxiway NG from left to right (with respect to the route of the aircraft).  There were no injuries. The Metro suffered substantial damage to the left hand wing tip. PROBABLE CAUSE (translated from Italian):  The accident was caused by the presence of a passenger bus inside the airport grounds on the taxiway used by an aircraft at the same time.  Among the factors that contributed to the event was the situation of poor visibility, determined by the light conditions (21.07 local time), the weather conditions, the position of the ""STOP"" signal too far back to have a good view of the traffic moving on the TWY, the artifacts in the area of the event. The above situation - probably not considered during the training phase of the airport drivers - led to the failure of the passenger vehicle to comply with the regulations contained in the DCA ordinance no. 24/98 (a taxiing aircraft always takes precedence over any vehicle circulating at the airport).Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ANSV Report number: A/35/04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  8 January 1982 HB-LNB Crossair 0 ZÃ¼rich-Kloten Airport (ZRH) min Runway excursion Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The copilot was Pilot Flying. The Beech took off at 20:30 and arrived near GhardaÃ¯a fourteen minutes later.  At 20:44 the flight was cleared for a right hand circuit in preparation for an approach to runway 30. At that moment a Boeing 727 was on long finals. The copilot stated that he intended to carry out an NDB/ILS approach to runway 30. The captain however preferred a visual approach. The copilot carried out the captain's course and descent instructions with hesitation. At 20:57, the EGPWS alarm sounded. Power was added and a climb was initiated from a lowest altitude of 240 feet above ground level. The captain then took over control and assumed the role of Pilot Flying. The airplane manoeuvred south of the airport until 21:01 when the copilot saw the runway. The captain rolled left to -57Â° and pitched down to -18.9Â° in order to steer the airplane towards the runway. Again the EGPWS sounded but the descent continued until the airplane impacted the ground and broke up. The five occupants survived the impact, but the co-pilot died a day later of his injuries. Causes of the accident (translated from French): The Commission believes that the accident can be explained by a series of several causes which, taken separately, would not lead to an accident. The causes are related to: 1 - the lack of rigor in the approach and landing phase evidenced by a failure to follow standard operating procedures, including the arrival checklist. 2 - the failure to strictly comply with the holding, approach and landing procedures in force for the aerodrome of GhardaÃ¯a. 3 - the fact that the captain seemed occupied by the visual search maneuvers that put him temporarily out of the control loop. He was so focused on the visual search for the runway and abandoned the monitoring of parameters that are critical for the safety of the flight. This concentration completely disoriented him. 4 - the fact that the crew did not respond appropriately to different alarms that occurred, indicating a lack of control in the operation of the aircraft in that kind of situation. Lack of control was apparently due to his lack of training on this aircraft type. 5 - The activities in the southern part of Algeria may cause a certain routine that can promote the tendency to conduct visual approaches. It seems, indeed, that the crew is more experienced in visual flights. 6 - A lack of coordination and communication between the crew members flying together for the first time.Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) Archives; Hassi Messaoud-Oued Irara Airport (HME); January 2004 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

After making a  turn onto the ramp, the airplane began to slide on top of an ice layer.  The brakes were ineffective and the co-pilot shut down the engines; however, due to the downward slope of the ramp area and the wind conditions, the airplane continued to accelerate. The airplane struck a concrete retaining wall, before it came to rest.  Examination of the ramp area revealed that it was covered with a 1-inch thick layer of smooth clear ice.  The operator of the ramp said that other airplanes had taxied into and out of the ramp without problem prior to, and after the accident. However, sand had been applied to the ramp for the other aircraft, but not the accident airplane.  In addition, the winds were lighter at the time the other aircraft were taxiing.  The weather at the time of the accident  included: wind from 270 degrees at 15 knots, and a temperature of 11 degrees F.

The airplane was operated by Phoenix Aviation and chartered by ExpoAir. Using GPS and DME the airplane approached Colombo. The approach controller cleared flight 3002 to descend to FL150. After reaching that altitude the navigator passed on the QNH and QFE values for Colombo: 1009 mb and 756 mm Hg. The altimeters were updated with this information. However, the copilot erroneously programmed 765 mm Hg into the altimeter. After turning left onto finals the aircraft, 14 km from the runway, descended to an altitude above sea level of 60 meters. The airplane descended slowly until the landing gear contacted the surface of the sea at a distance of 10,7 km short of runway 04. Climb power was applied and the navigator reported that they were going around: ""PHG 3-0-0-2 go around, again I call you established localizer"". At a height of 60-90 meters however, the captain decided to continue the approach. Assuming the undercarriage had been substantially damaged, he decided to carry out a belly landing on the side of the runway. Touchdown was accomplished 50 meters to the right of the runway and 450 meters passed the threshold. The aircraft skidded and came to rest 2230 meters further on. The Ilyushin was away and parked in a corner of the airport, where it was still noted in May 2004.Sources: Information on the aviation incident with the aircraft IL-18D EX-005 / Russian Ministry of Transport   Location  Images: photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Sharjah Airport (SHJ); December 2002 photo (c) Aktug Ates; Antalya Airport (AYT); 06 May 2001 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates25-Nov-2024 14:45 ASN Updated [Operator, ]25-Nov-2024 14:45 ASN Updated [Location, Destination airport, ]25-Nov-2024 14:45 ASN Updated [Damage, ]10-Feb-2025 08:32 ASN Updated [Location, ]10-Feb-2025 08:33 ASN Updated [Destination airport, ]24-Feb-2025 19:11 ASN Updated [Operator, Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Following some upper level air work, the crew requested, and were granted a clearance for, a simulated engine failure and descent to 2,000 ft. The pilot in command retarded the power lever to the flight idle stop and the fuel condition lever to the low idle range, setting a value of 55% engine gas generator speed (Ng). The pilot under training then set the glide attitude at the best glide speed of about 79 knots indicated airspeed and feather the propeller The PIC reported that he instructed the pilot under training to advance the emergency power lever (EPL) to simulate manual introduction of fuel to the engine. He then noticed that there was no engine torque increase, with the engine inter-turbine temperature (ITT or T5) and Ng rapidly decreasing, and a strong smell of fuel in the cockpit. Despite several efforts to relight the engine, they were not successful. They then completed a successful landing in a depth of about 2 m of water near Green Island. The aircraft sustained minor damage during the ditching, but subsequent substantial damage due to salt water immersion. SIGNIFICANT FACTORS:  1. The pilots of CYC were conducting in-flight familiarization training using the emergency power lever. That procedure was not contained in the aircraft manufacturerÂs pilot operating handbook. 2. The engine manufacturerÂs documentation contained information on the use of the emergency power lever, which did not preclude the use of the emergency power lever for in-flight familiarization training. 3. The engine sustained a flameout at an altitude above mean sea level from which reignition of the engine was not successfully completed. 4. Erosion of the first-stage compressor blades would have reduced the aerodynamic efficiency of the compressor blades.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ATSB Report number: ATSB Occurrence 200400443 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: ATSB History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  12 March 1999 VH-CYC 0 4 km N Cairns Airport non Location  Images: photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Cairns Airport, QLD (CNS/YBCS); April 1997 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

During the landing roll the right main landing gear partially retracted and the aircraft veered to the right until it finally left the paved surface, crossed the grass, and came to rest about 139 metres to the right of the runway centreline. Four safety recommendations have been made as a result of the investigation.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: EW/C2004/02/02 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: AAIB Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates21-Dec-2024 19:13 ASN Added 21-Dec-2024 19:15 ASN Updated [Location, Nature, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The runway was 3,200 feet long and 60 feet wide, and the surface had areas of packed snow and ice.  A right crosswind was estimated between 15 to 25 knots.  About 300 feet after beginning the takeoff roll, between 30 to 50 knots airspeed, the airplane began to drift to the left, which the pilot was unable to correct.  The airplane departed off the left side of the runway and nosed over.  The airplane received damage to the wings, fuselage, and empennage.  The maximum demonstrated crosswind velocity, takeoff or landing, is 20 knots. Probable Cause and Findings: The pilot's inadequate planning and decision to initiate a takeoff into a crosswind that exceeded the airplane's demonstrated crosswind component, which resulted in a loss of directional control during the takeoff roll, and subsequent collision with terrain and nose over. Factors contributing to the accident were the crosswind, an icy runway, and the pilot's failure to abort the takeoff.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ANC04LA032 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  30 January 2003 N1276P Grant Aviation 0 Russian Mission, Alaska sub 11 March 2011 PK-MAD Mission Aviation Fellowship - MAF 0 Mulia Airport (LII) sub Runway excursion 10 March 2021 PK-MAD Mission Aviation Fellowship - MAF 0 Angguruk Airstrip sub Undershoot Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

A Fokker 50 passenger plane, operated by Kish Air, was destroyed when it crashed near Sharjah Airport (SHJ), United Arab Emirates. All six crew members and 37 of the 40 passengers were killed. The aircraft was operating as a scheduled flight from Kish Island, Iran to Sharjah, UAE with the captain initially as the pilot flying (PF).  During the cruise and just prior to descent, the captain unexpectedly handed over control of the aircraft to the First Officer prior to the approach to Sharjah. The first officer did not accept this willingly and stated that he was not confident of his ability to conduct a VOR/DME approach into Sharjah. This statement was not consistent with his previous experience and could indicate either a cultural or professional issue. The captain insisted the first officer fly the aircraft and encouraged and instructed him during the approach.  At 11:24 hours local time, the aircraft contacted Dubai Arrivals and was cleared from 9000 ft to 5000 ft and instructed to expect a VOR/DME approach to runway 12 at Sharjah International Airport. At 11:29 hours the aircraft was further cleared to 2500 ft and cleared for the approach. The aircraft was under its own navigation and the daylight conditions were fine with excellent visibility. At 11:35 hours the aircraft was instructed to contact Sharjah Tower and the pilot reported that the aircraft was established on the VOR final approach for runway 12. The Tower cleared IRK7170 to land and advised that the wind was calm.  At that point the aircraft was slightly above the approach profile. The initial speed for the approach was at least 50 kt high at approximately 190 kt with no flap and no landing gear. The aircraft should have been configured with landing gear down and flap 10Â° during the approach and stabilized at 130 kt prior to the MDA. Approaching the MDA at flight idle setting, the auto-pilot was disengaged and the first Officer called for flap 10 at 186 kt (limiting speed of 180 kt) and flap 25 was selected by the Captain, a setting uncalled for by the Pilot Flying at 183 kt (limiting speed of 160 kt), and the landing gear was called for and selected at approximately 185 kt (limiting speed of 170 kt). The captain then took control of the aircraft and shortly afterwards the ground range selectors were heard by Cockpit Voice Recorder to be lifted and the power levers moved from the flight idle stop into the ground control range.  The left propeller then went to full reverse whilst the right propeller remained in positive pitch within the ground control range. The aircraft descended in an extreme nose low left bank attitude until impact. The aircraft crashed 2.6 nm from the runway onto an unprepared sandy area adjacent to a road and residential buildings. The aircraft broke apart on impact and a fire started immediately. Cause:  The power levers were moved by a pilot from the flight idle position into the ground control range, which led to an irreversible loss of flight control.  Contributory Causes: 1. By suddenly insisting the First Officer fly the final approach, the pilot in command created an environment, which led to a breakdown of crew resource management processes, the non observance of the operatorÂs standard operating procedures and a resultant excessive high approach speed.  2. An attempt to rectify this excessive high approach speed most likely resulted in the non compliance with the Standard Operating Procedures and the movement of the power levers below flight idle.  3.  The unmodified version of the Skid Control Unit failed to provide adequate protection at the time of the event.Sources: SKYbraryÂ   GulfNews  ICAO Adrep  Kish Air crash due to human factors: probe (Khaleej Times, 20 April 2006)  BBC, IRNA   Location  Images: photo (c) ; Sharjah Airport (SHJ); February 2004 photo (c) ; Sharjah Airport (SHJ); February 2004 photo (c) Dmitry Avdeev; Sharjah Airport (SHJ); 12 January 2005; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) Ger Buskermolen; Sharjah Airport (SHJ); 09 February 2004 photo (c) Heinz Rentmeister; Sharjah Airport (SHJ); 09 February 2004 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates03-Jan-2025 12:21 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Further higher amplitude shimmying of the left MLG ensued, resulting in severe MLG tyre, wheel and brake damage and substantial oscillatory loads on the aircraft structure. Steering difficulties were experienced during both shimmying episodes. It was likely that the shimmying resulted from excessive wear of the torsion link apex joint that reduced the effectiveness of the shimmy damper.

The Push Tug Operator was not on the FAA's safety-sensitive list.  An airline representative reported that the airline's policy is to accomplish a pre-employment drug test for all safety-sensitive and non safety-sensitive employees.  The Push Tug Operator's pre-employment drug test was reported as negative.  The airline had a drug policy and an employee assistance program in-place at the time of the accident.  An airline representative reported that the supervisor and coordinator for the accident gate area were two gates away and did not directly observe the accident pushback.  Subsequent to the accident, the airline established a policy of random drug testing for all employees as a condition of employment.

The aircraft was authorized by Rome ACC to directly enter the airway M126, without carrying out the standard instrument departure. The en route part of the flight to Cagliari was uneventful.  At 05.37, Rome ACC instructed flight 124 to contact Cagliari APP, After radio contact was established , Cagliari APP provided the weather at the aerodrome: runway in use 32, wind 7 knots from 320Â°, visibility 12 km scattered clouds at 2000 feet, temperature 10Â° C, dew point 9Â° C, QNH 1012. At 05.41.12, Cagliari APP instructed CIT 124, which at that time was at the waypoint Aledo, to continue the descent over the next waypoint LEDRO up to 5000 feet, to carry out the ILS procedure for a landing on runway 32 and report at Carbonara VOR. The commander, reading back the instructions, requested permission to conduct a visual approach should he obtain visual contact with the airport: ""Roger, we are cleared now to descend to five thousand feet on the QNH one zero one two and we passing Ledro cleared by ILS three two papa and if we have field visually, we would like to have a visual approach."" This was confirmed by Cagliari APP. At 05:43 the flight crew radioed: ""CIT 124, we have the field in sight requesting visual approach."" At that time the aircraft was at FL 96, about 28 nm from Carbonara VOR and about 41 nm from Cagliari VOR. Cagliari APP then asked CIT 124 about the ability to maintain obstacle clearance: ""confirm able to maintain your own separation from the obstacles sir, performing visual approach runway three two"". The pilot just replied: ""affirmative, CIT 124"". About three minutes later, Cagliari APP informed CIT 124 to continue the descent without descending below 2500 feet and contact Elmas TWR for the further descent: ""[...] CIT 124 continue not below 2500 feet, further descent with Elmas Tower 120.6 bye"" The pilot contacted Elmas TWR at 05:47: ""Elmas Tower, buongiorno, CIT 124, visual, left procedure, for visual approach runway 32."" Elmas TWR responded by reporting the runway in use (32), wind conditions (8 knots from 310Â°), and told the flight to report on short final for runway 32. This was read back by the crew.  Two minutes later, while descending over mountainous terrain, flight 124 collided with the side of Su Baccu Malu Mountain (3333 feet). CAUSA E FATTORI CONTRIBUTIVI LÂincidente, classificabile come CFIT, Ã¨ stato causato dalla conduzione del volo ad una quota significativamente inferiore allÂaltitudine minima di settore, insufficiente a mantenere la separazione dal terreno, durante un avvicinamento a vista notturno in assenza di adeguati riferimenti visivi.  Sono stati individuati i seguenti possibili fattori contributivi dellÂincidente: - strumentazione dellÂaeromobile non comprendente uno strumento GPWS o TAWS, la cui installazione non Ã¨ richiesta dalla normativa; - lÂassunzione da parte dellÂequipaggio di riferimenti visivi erronei, confusi con le luci pista di Elmas, tenuto conto che lÂequipaggio non aveva particolare familiaritÃ  con la zona di Cagliari; lÂinsorgenza, nellÂequipaggio, di fenomeni di illusione ottica, con specifico riferimento al cosiddetto ""black hole approach""; - il fraintendimento, da parte dellÂequipaggio, dellÂistruzione data da Cagliari APP allÂatto del trasferimento a Elmas TWR (""CIT 124 continue not below 2500 feet, further descent with Elmas TWR 120.6 bye""), che potrebbe aver ingenerato il convincimento, malgrado lo stesso equipaggio avesse confermato di essere in grado di separarsi autonomamente dagli ostacoli, che la discesa fino a quella quota fosse libera da ostacoli; - mancato utilizzo delle procedure strumentali pubblicate e disponibili nella conduzione di avvicinamento su di un aeroporto e in unÂarea non conosciuti, in condizioni di totale oscuritÃ ; - lÂanticipazione della deviazione dallÂaerovia, forse decisa per cercare di accelerare lÂarrivo a destinazione, che ha determinato il sorvolo di aree di maggiore elevazione; - errori di lettura delle quote riportate nelle carte consultate, facilitati dalla mancata rappresentazione a colori del terreno; - il prolungato periodo di veglia senza adeguato riposo, che potrebbe aver contribuito a ridurre la performance dellÂequipaggio. translated from the original Italian text: CAUSE AND CONTRIBUTORY FACTORS The accident, classified as CFIT, was caused by the conduct of the flight at a height significantly below the Area Minimum Altitude, insufficient to maintain the separation from the ground during a night visual approach in the absence of adequate visual reference. possible contributory factors that have been identified: - The aircraft instrumentation did not include a GPWS or TAWS, whose installation is not required by law; - The erroneous descent by visual flight references, confusing the Elmas runway lights, given that the crew had no special familiarity with the area of Cagliari, the onset of a perspective illusions phenomena, with specific reference to the so-called ""black hole approach""; - The misunderstanding by crew members, of the Cagliari Approach controllers instruction to transfer to Elmas TWR (""CIT 124 continue not below 2500 feet, further descent with Elmas TWR 120.6 bye "") which may have created the impression, despite the crew had confirmed that they are able to separate themselves from the obstacles that the descent down was free of obstructions; - Failure to use published procedures and available instruments in a descent to a closer airport and in an unfamiliar area , under conditions of total darkness; - The anticipation of the deviation from the airway perhaps caused [the crew] to try to speed up the arrival at destination, which determined overflying areas of higher elevation; - Read errors of the elevations listed in the maps consulted, facilitated by the non representation of the ground color; - The extended period of wakefulness without adequate rest, which may have contributed to a reduction in the performance of the crew.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ANSV Report number: ANSV report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   ANSV   Location  Images: photo (c) Werner Fischdick; DÃ¼sseldorf Airport (DUS); 22 April 1985 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft diverted its course to Las Palmas airport, where the seriously injured passenger with signs of hemiplegia was disembarked to be taken to a hospital for medical assistance. There was no forecast turbulence in the area where the accident occurred. There were no visible clouds. No turbulence announcements were given and the fasten seat belt signs remained off. Causes The accident was caused by the penetration of the aircraft in an area of turbulence when passengers were not secured with their seat belts. The seat belt signs were not lit, because turbulence was not expected. The turbulence was probably of a convectively-induced turbulence (CIT) nature and was neither detected nor were people warned.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIAIAC Report number: A-011/2004 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: CIAIAC Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates29-Jul-2023 09:45 harro Added Corrections or additions? ...

The airplane carried Macedonian President Boris Trajkovski and other officials. All aboard were killed in the accident. Based on the investigation and analysis of the collected evidence and documents available, the Commission concluded that the immediate cause of the aircraft accident of Beechcraft Super King Air 200 registration Z3-BAB was the following: Descending below the minimum descent altitude-MDA of 1810 feet for the published procedure for precision approach for landing at the airport in Mostar: 1:06 Mostar-LQMO, VOR/DME RWY 34 (Jeppesen 13-1), resulting in a Controlled Flight Into Terrain-CFIT. The main factors that have led to a descent below the minimum published heights are as follows: a) Very poor quality and lack of preparation of the crew for the approach and landing; b) Ignoring the information of air traffic controllers on the current meteorological situation at LQMO Airport; c) Wrong determination of the FAF (Final Approach Final Fix- point of access) and its replacement with the IAF (Intermediate Approach Fix- Central point of access) which led to an earlier start of the descent. d) To turn off the autopilot during the approach phase, taking into account the complex meteorological situation; e) Low crew teamwork (CRM Crew Resource Management) - lack of communication and failure to follow standard operating procedures; f) Failure to maintain level flight by Pilot Flying and inadequate response by pilots Assisting Pilot, at the stage of reaching the MDA Minimum Descent Altitude.METAR: 07:00 UTC / 08:00 local time:Wind from 340Â° at 10 kts; Visibility: 8 km; Scattered clouds at 600 feet; Broken clouds at 1600 feet and 7300 feet; Temperature: 5Â° C; Pressure: 1003 mbAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: MKT Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 10 years and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) Karl KrÃ¤mer, via Werner Fischdick; MÃ¼nchen-Franz Josef Strauss Airport (MUC/EDDM); February 2000 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The captain reported the seat belt sign was turned on as they descended through 18,000 feet.  He reported they encountered about 15 seconds of moderate turbulence as they passed through 16,000 feet.  He reported there were no weather returns in the area and they were back in smooth air after the encounter.  The first officer reported that he informed the flight attendants to take their seats as soon as they began to encounter the turbulence.  He reported he was getting ready to call the flight attendants after the turbulence to make sure they were alright, when the cockpit received a call from the back stating that one of the flight attendants injured her ankle.  The first officer reported that they requested paramedics meet the flight upon landing.  The injured flight attendant reported she was in the aft galley when they encountered the turbulence.  She stated she tried to get in the jumpseat, but was unable to because of the turbulence.  The injured flight attendant stated she heard another flight attendant tell a passenger who was in the aft galley to sit on the floor, so she decided to do the same.  She stated that as she was sitting down, the ""plane dropped"" and she fell.  Once the turbulence subsided, the other flight attendant and a passenger helped her off the floor and into a seat.  None of the flight attendants recalled having any advance warning of the turbulence.  Rapidly building convective activity was evident along the upper Mississippi Valley at the time of the accident.  Convective tops averaging FL250 in the area were moving north-northeast at 60 knots.  Severe Weather Advisory 15S, valid from 1731 universal coordinated time (UTC) to 2301 UTC, covered the route of flight from the Mississippi River to ORD.  The severe thunderstorm watch included a forecast for hail, surface wind gusts to 60 knots, maximum cloud tops to FL450, and a storm motion vector to 240 degrees at 35 knots.  Convective Sigmet 25C was valid until 2255UTC.  The Sigmet called for an area of embedded thunderstorms moving from 190 degrees at 20 knots.  The thunderstorms had tops to FL300.  Data from the digital flight data recorder shows the airplane experienced vertical acceleration fluctuations from a minimum of 0.437 g's, to a maximum of 1.994 g's, and back to 0.576 g's in less then 3 seconds.

In Ankara the airplane was loaded with 39980 kg of cargo. The next stop was Baku, Azerbaijan for refueling. The airplane took 47 tons of fuel, bringing the takeoff weight to 189 tons, and the centre of gravity to 29,3% MAC, which was within the prescribed limits. During the eight-hour stopover the crew decided to rest in the aircraft instead of a hotel. As the aircraft started taxiing to the runway the flight engineer was heard saying that he would select the flaps at 30 degrees and slats at 14 degrees for takeoff. This however was not done. Prior to takeoff the position of the flaps was not verified by any of the crew members. Takeoff was thus commenced with flaps and slats retracted and the stabilizer trimmed at the takeoff position -4 degrees (corresponding to actual takeoff weight, CofG and flaps at 30Â°). At a speed of 210 km/h the pilot pulled on the control column to lift off the nose gear. At a calculated unstick speed of 265 km/h the angle of attack reached 9 degrees but the plane did not lift off the runway. Accelerating through 290 km/h the angle of attack of the aircraft reached 14,5 degrees, setting off the angle of attack warning on the flight deck. Some 1750 meters down the runway, the aft fuselage struck the runway. Seventy meters further on, at a speed of 300 km/h and an angle of attack of 19,4Â°, the Ilyushin lifted off the runway. The air traffic controller who witnessed the departure advised the crew to abort the takeoff, but the captain apparently continued. The airplane rolled to the left until the wing contacted the runway. Then the flight engineer noted his error and, without informing the captain, began extending the flaps and slats. Again without informing the captain, the flight engineer brought back the power levers of the four engines to idle. After three seconds he moved them from idle to the 'engine shutdown' position. The captain three times yelled ""takeoff"" but the engines were already shut down. After flying for 490 meters the aircraft struck the ground and crashed.Sources: Information on the aviation incident with the aircraft Il-76TD UR-ZVA / Russian Ministry of Transport No. 22.15-568  MAK Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC)  RIA Novosti   Location  Images: photo (c) Oliver KÃ¶stinger; Sharjah Airport (SHJ/OMSJ) photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Oostende Airport (OST/EBOS); March 1995 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

After 01:20 of flight, the instruction phase for the first trainee was completed. When the Canadair stopped on the lake, the two co-pilots switched places. The second trainee took the controls and began his training session with hydroplaning in accordance with the training program. Before starting the next exercise, the instructor reminded the trainee of the actions to be taken to achieve this phenomenon. He reminded that the speed must remain below 55 kt.  The trainee, still at the controls, extended the flaps to 10Â°, the takeoff configuration. He then proceeded to accelerate the aircraft by advancing the throttle to obtain an engine torque close to that required for takeoff. As the Canadair accelerated, the trainee applied elevator to initiate the porpoise. The airspeed continued to increase and the Canadair took off without the porpoising phenomenon having occurred. The trainee moved the power levers to minimum. The aircraft struck the water and the crew felt a shock. As the aircraft continued to move through the water in deceleration, the instructor pointed out to the trainee the loss of the right-hand float. The instructor decided to abort the training mission and took over the controls to return to the Marseille-Provence Airport. The instructor then undertook to take off. As soon as the aircraft took off, it slowly tilted to the right even though the control column was positioned to the left. The instructor then positioned the control column to the left, but the bank continued to increase. The instructor told the two co-pilots that he was having difficulty controlling the aircraft. The co-pilot trainee, sitting in the middle seat, suggested switching to manual control. The instructor did not accept this option and put the aircraft in descent. He asked the trainee in the right seat to put the flaps in the 25Â° position which corresponded to the landing configuration. The aircraft, still banked and descending, hit the water with its right wing. The instructor and the trainee in the center seat died. The trainee in training was seriously injured. CAUSES OF THE ACCIDENT  (translation from French report) The accident is the consequence of a chain of causes of human origin which lead to the loss of control in roll of the aircraft:  The accident can be broken down into 2 phases:   - A first phase that leads to the damage of the flight controls during the impact with the water following the stall of the aircraft. The stall is the result of the trainee's failure to execute the flight controls, which was not countered by the instructor. The trainee's failure to perform at the very beginning of Canadair training was part of a context of:  -- a failure to comply with the training framework: Contrary to what the progression booklet states, the instructor did not demonstrate the porpoising. He entrusted the commands to the trainee.  -- pedagogical error: The instructor did not follow a trainee who was performing an exercise for the first time.  -- lack of control of the parameters (speed) by the crew.   - A second phase that lead to the loss of the aircraft and part of its crew. It resulte from an underestimation of the damage to the aircraft during the impact with the water and from the decision of the captain to take off without checking the flight controls.   It is common practice for crews to continue flying loss of a float during a scoop. The instructor assimilated the circumstances of the float loss he was confronted with to those already encountered during scooping operations. He proceeded with the takeoff without checking the flight controls that were damaged during the stall.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEAD Report number: BEAD-air-S-2004-006-A Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Air Forces Monthly, May 2004   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The nose wheel steering was inoperative and had been deferred in accordance with the operator's Minimum Equipment List (MEL).  In that situation, the nose wheel was in the ""free castor mode.""  The MEL states that directional control is to be maintained by using brakes and differential power.  The pilot reported that the landing touch down was on the centerline, however, shortly afterward the aircraft encountered an ""overwhelming"" wind gust which caused it to weathervane to the left.  He reported that he applied full right rudder and differential right braking which was effective in stopping the aircraft's drift.  However, the aircraft encountered a second ""much stronger and sustained"" gust, which caused the aircraft to ""veer strongly to the left.""  His subsequent efforts to maintain directional control through the use of differential braking and differential engine thrust were insufficient to keep the aircraft from departing the runway pavement.  The aircraft came to rest in the soft grass adjacent to the runway.  The pilot attempted to taxi back onto the runway, however, the nose wheel contacted the edge of the pavement and collapsed.  Distinct ruts were observed in the soft turf adjacent to the left side of the runway.  The nose wheel tire track approached the edge of the pavement at approximately a 20-degree angle and terminated at the edge of the runway.  The track was approximately eight inches deep relative to the level of the runway pavement.  The published maximum demonstrated crosswind component for the aircraft was 22 knots.  The operator did not impose a crosswind component limitation on operations in general or on operations with the nose wheel steering inoperative under the MEL.  Surface winds provided to the flight crew by the control tower were 310 degrees at 23 knots, gusting to 30 knots. Probable Cause: The captain's improper decision due to his attempt to taxi back onto the runway after coming to a stop in the grass, and the resulting collapse of nose landing gear.  Contributing factors were the inoperative nose wheel steering, the pilot's inability to maintain directional control during the landing roll due to the crosswind, and the high crosswind component.  Additional factors were the uneven transition between the grass and the runway pavement, as well as the soft grass.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CHI04LA086 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: NTSB: https://www.ntsb.gov/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/brief.aspx?ev_id=20040319X00351&key=1  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates23-Feb-2015 14:52 Noro Added 21-Dec-2016 19:28 ASN Update Bot Updated [Time, Damage, Category, Investigating agency, ]07-Dec-2017 17:48 ASN Update Bot Updated [Operator, Other fatalities, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The pilot attempted to re-cycle the landing gear but without success; later he noticed that he also had indications of LIFT DUMP FAIL and ANTI SKID FAIL. He diverted to Farnborough. After touchdown the pilot attempted to deploy the lift dump system but, as expected, the lift dump spoilers failed to extend. After discussing the problem with the aircraft's maintenance organisation, the aircraft was flown to Blackbushe for further technical investigation. After landing on runway 26 (4400 feet long) the aircraft left the runway, struck a series of obstructions and was destroyed. The support bracket for the right main landing gear weight-on-wheels switch was found to have sustained a pre-impact failure which accounted for the indications reported by the pilot.Sources: AAIB Bulletin 1/2005   Location  Images: photo (c) aeroprints.com; Rantoul, KS; 30 April 2013; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Inspection of the airplane revealed that the engine cowling upper forward hinge required three bolts.  However, only one bolt remained attached, and there was no evidence that the other two bolts tore away during flight.  Fretting was observed in the area of the bolt holes, consistent with an oscillation over a period of time, due to the absence of two bolts.  The airliner maintenance manual required a general inspection of the area, but did not specifically mention cowling hinge bolts.  In addition, the hinges were located in an area that was not easily accessible to maintenance personnel. Probable Cause: The failure of the number two upper forward right engine cowling attachment, which resulted in substantial damage to the right inboard elevator.

Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed. The commercial-rated pilot received minor injuries, and one passenger received serious injuries, and the airplane was destroyed. The flight originated at Stuart-Witham Field, FL (SUA) the same day, about 18:45. The pilot stated that he initiated a fuel transfer due to a fuel imbalance. To affect the fuel transfer, he said he ""began crossfeed right to left."" When the airplane was about 5 to 10 miles away from Spruce Creek Airport, the pilot said he began his descent from 12,500, and also executed a left turn to begin setting up to land, when suddenly, both engines ceased operating. When he levelled the wings both engines restarted due to auto-ignition. He said the fuel gages showed 300 to 350 lb of fuel for the right tank, and 100 to 150 pounds on the left, so he decided to continue his approach to Spruce Creek Airport. As he approached Spruce Creek Airport, he again entered a left bank to prepare for a left base to runway 23, and while established in the left turn, both engines ceased operating a second time. He said he did not think he could reach the runway, and decided to make an landing on a taxiway. When the wings became level after the turn, he said both engines again restarted while in the vicinity of the beginning of the taxiway. As he was about to land, he said a car pulled out onto the taxiway, and stopped on the centerline, so he applied power to avoid the car. He said he climbed straight out, and when he made a climbing left turn, he said the engines ceased operating a third time, and the airplane descended towards a cluster of condos. With no runway or clear area in sight, the pilot said he guided the airplane to a retention pond. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The pilot's inadequate management of the airplane's fuel system, which resulted in fuel starvation, a loss of engine power, a forced landing, and damage to the airplane during the landing.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: MIA04LA071 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The co-pilot was at the controls and was flying a non-precision approach for runway 05. The pilot-in-command took the controls less than one mile from the runway threshold and saw the runway when they were over the threshold. At approximately 10:18 the wheels touched down approximately 1500 feet from the end of runway 05. The pilot-in-command realized that the remaining landing distance was insufficient. He told the co-pilot to retract the flaps and applied full power, but did not reveal his intentions. The co-pilot cut power, selected reverse pitch and applied full braking. The aircraft continued rolling through the runway end, sank into the gravel and snow, and stopped abruptly about 500 feet past the runway end. The aircraft was severely damaged. None of the occupants were injured. FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1. The aircraft was positioned over the runway threshold at an altitude that did not allow a landing at the beginning of the runway, and this, combined with a tailwind component and the wet runway surface, resulted in a runway excursion. 2. Failure to follow standard operating procedures and a lack of crew coordination contributed to confusion on landing, which prevented the crew from aborting the landing and executing a missed approach. 3. The pilot-in-command held several management positions within the company and controlled the pilot hiring and dismissal policies. This situation, combined with the level of experience of the co-pilot compared with that of the pilot-in-command, had an impact on crew cohesiveness.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A04Q0049 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: TSB   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The next flight was to Trieste (TRS); the copilot was the pilot flying on this leg. The airplane departed at 08:47. The MD-82 landed at Trieste's runway 09 after an uneventful flight. The crew were cleared to taxi to the ramp and took taxiway Bravo, which was the first taxiway to the right. With the sun in front the view of the crew was bit hampered. At the last moment the captain noticed a vehicle to his right hand side. He steered to the left to avoid it, but the truck impacted the right wing. The outer part of the wing (3,5 m/ca. 11 feet) was almost completely sheared off. The fuel tank ruptured, causing a fuel spill on the taxiway. After noticing the spill, the crew ordered an emergency evacuation of the airplane. The evacuation was initiated one minute and 20 seconds after the collision. One minute and 24 seconds later, the fire brigade had reached the scene. It appeared that construction works were in progress near taxiway Bravo. A Notam was not issued about this and the tower controller had not informed the crew either. CAUSES (translated from Italian): The analysis of the technical, operational and organizational context in which the event took place (impact of the end of the right wing of the aircraft, during taxiing, against the rear body of a truck that was parked for work within the protection area of the taxiway that leads from the BRAVO connection to the parking area) has allowed to determine the following causes, which are attributable to human and environmental factors. - Failure to close the BRAVO taxiway with the issue of the relative NOTAM of the works in progress. - Failure of the Torre control to provide the pilots with essential information on the condition of the airport, as provided for by ICAO in ICAO Doc. 4444 PANS-ATM. - Vertical and horizontal ground signs do not correspond to those specified in ICAO Annex 14. - Failure to comply with the ENAC circular (APT-11), applicable for the type of work in progress at the airport. - Insufficient surveillance of the airport area affected by the works by ENAC and the airport management company Aeroporto FVG. - Lack of an airport Safety Management System . - Inadequate surveillance of the external space during taxiing by the flight crew, resulting in incorrect assessment of the position of the aircraft with respect to the obstacle.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ANSV Report number: A/9/05 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: ANSV   Location  Images: photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Roma-Fiumicino Airport (FCO); 16 June 2001 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

En route on the first leg, at an altitude of FL170, a crew member headed to the cargo compartment, and noticed the presence of smoke. he tried to extinguish the fire with emergency equipment, but did not succeed. Some 16 nm from Melo Airport (MLZ), Uruguay, the crew declared an in-flight emergency to Montevideo ACC. The operating hours of the only airport nearby, Melo, are from 07:00 hrs to 19:00 hrs, so it was closed. Montevideo ACC contacted the airport guard who switched on the runway lights and reported the emergency to fire fighters and police located in the city. The aircraft found the runway lights and landed on runway 07. Touchdown took place 340 m from the threshold. The F-27 stopped 640 m after touchdown. The crew evacuated through the cockpit windows, due to the intense heat and smoke in the cargo area. Ten minutes after landing, the fire fighters arrived and succeeded in extinguishing the fire. The airplane suffered considerable damage in the cargo compartments E and F. PROBABLE CAUSE (translated from Spanish): Numerous oil samples, plant tissues, and several animals that were transported, would have reacted on contact with an exothermic chemical reaction and associated combustion. The event originated with the spilling of liquid from containers not suitable for differential pressure, with little excess capacity for expansion and filled with indiscriminate materials. Low stringency in filling forms for description of product delivered for shipment in company offices and little control or careless handling of the load would have contributed to the occurrence of the accident.Sources: ICAO Adrep  NTSB  Images: photo (c) Jose Maria Techera; Melo Airport (MLZ/SUMO); 02 August 2015 photo (c) Elliot Greenman, via Werner Fischdick; Pittsburgh International Airport, PA (PIT/KPIT) [N]; May 1990 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The three pilots and five mechanics escaped unhurt. The airplane was attached to the Escadron de Transport Outre-Mer 58 (ETOM 00.058) and was being prepared for a test flight. Shortly after start-up, just as the airplane has commenced taxiing towards the runway, a fire erupted. The airplane was stopped immediately. Three minutes later the fire services arrived and extinguished the fire. The airplane sustained serious damage to the left wing, left hand fuselage and tail section. CAUSES:  The accident was caused by electrical arcing at the power cable to a submersible fuel pump. This arcing occured above the kerosene liquid inside the tank full of fuel vapors. The cable type used was chosen at the time of the design of the aircraft. Atmospheric conditions on the apron of Fort de France have raised the temperature of the reservoir beyond the flash point kerosene. The vapors contained in this tank were explosive, and the arc was enough to initiate the blast. As such, atmospheric conditions are a certain cause of environmental origin of the accident. The appearance of the arc is, in turn, has only technical causes: - The quality of cable used and age are in fact responsible for the creation of the electric arc. - The formation of the insulating sheath of this type of cable is not likely to ensure an absolute seal. This quality is also not claimed by its manufacturer. Indeed, the analyzes carried out show a porosity of electrical cable, even nine, therefore that it is soaked in kerosene. The presence of kerosene increases the phenomenon of porosity of old cables. Degradation characteristics of dielectric strength of the cable insulation explains the appearance of the arc. The accident occurred while the cable was over 19 years old. The fuel pumps wiring has never been a problem. But there has not been a cable that had reached the age of 19 years. The aging of the cable could still degrade the seal. Finally, maintaining this type of cable on the first C160 series until this accident was part of a complex process in which traceability has not been formally established. Doubts indeed appeared in 1969 on the quality of these cables, doubts that can be considered today as precursors. Measures had been adopted precisely to overcome these deficiencies.  In this regard, the replacement of the fuel pump wiring of the second series C 160 of these cables with a newer type and considered more efficient is particularly significant. Its extension to the first series aircraft might have seemed relevant, and would probably have prevented the accident. The reasons which led to the maintenance of such cables on the C 160 series first held in both the human factor (underestimation of risk, lack of global view on the issue) and organizational factors, which can be seen as a lack of traceability of technical and logistic actions, a lack of consistency of the measures adopted, and probable deficiencies in the information flow.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEAD Report number: BEAD-A-2004-012-A Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: Scramble 321   Location  Images: photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Mildenhall RAF Station (MHZ); August 1990 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Following the startup of the engines, an explosion occurred in the left wing area aft of the number 1 engine firewall and number 1 auxiliary fuel tank.  The airplane was parked next to the mine's fuel storage tank, and the pilot added power on the remaining engines to move away from the storage tank.  Within seconds of beginning to move, the number 1 engine fell off the burning wing, followed by separation and aft folding of the outboard end of the left wing.  The outboard end of the wing, however, was still attached via control cables.  The pilot taxied the airplane about 200 feet, dragging the partially burning left wing segment to a pond of water and shut down the remaining engines. The crew evacuated with no injuries.  Water was applied to the airplane until the fire was extinguished, about 3 1/2 hours later.  NTSB and FAA personnel did not travel to the scene, and the airplane was not recovered from the mining strip.  The airplane's left wing powerplant and fuel system consists of the number 1 and 2 engines.  Each engine is separated from the wing by a firewall.  Within the wing, from outboard to inboard, the fuel tank system consists of the number 1 fuel tank, the left wing auxiliary fuel tank, and the number 2 fuel tank.  Each wet-wing type fuel tank contains a submerged electrical boost pump, sump drain valves and fuel quantity transmitters.  The fuel system has selector valves, crossfeed valves, and shut-off valves for each tank.  An FAA inspector examined portions of the airplane that the operator supplied.  The inspector examined a portion of the upper wing surface that had been blown away from the airplane during the initial explosion.  He noted that the inside of the upper wing surface, normally positioned over the auxiliary tank, was not charred or sooted.  A separated portion of the lower wing surface, near the auxiliary boost pump, was sooted and charred.  The aft side of the number 1 engine firewall was not charred.  A portion of the number 1 engine nacelle was oily, but not sooted or charred.  The operator located the auxiliary in-tank boost pump and sent it to the FAA.  The boost pump impeller, encased in a small wire cage, was not melted and could be turned by hand.  The body of the pump was sooted but not thermally damaged.  Its wire connectors and one fuel line were melted.  A smaller line, what appeared to be a return line, was not melted.

The captain was the nonflying pilot for the flight, and the first officer was the flying pilot. The takeoff, climb, and en route portions of the flight were uneventful. At 14:37, as the flight approached the San Juan traffic area, the ATIS reported that winds were 060 degrees at 17 knots and gusting at 23 knots. Shortly thereafter, the captain briefed a Vref (the minimum approach airspeed in the landing configuration before the airplane reaches the runway threshold) of 95 knots and told the first officer to ""stand by for winds."" At 14:43 SJU Terminal Radar Approach Control cautioned the pilots of possible wake turbulence from a preceding Boeing. The captain told the first officer to slow down to about 140 kts. At 14:46, the local controller cleared the airplane to land on runway 08. The first officer turned the airplane left toward runway 08 and transitioned to the visual approach slope indicator. At 14:49, the captain stated, ""you better keep that nose down or get some power up because you're gonna balloon."" The airplane descended below the glideslope, causing a GPWS ""glideslope"" alert. The airplane was about 45 feet above ground level and traveling at 110 knots indicated airspeed when it crossed the runway 08 threshold. After the airplane crossed the runway threshold, the captain stated, ""power in a little bit, don't pull the nose up, don't pull the nose up."" At 14:49:39, the captain stated, ""you're ballooning,"" and the first officer replied, ""all right.""  The airplane touched down for the first time about 14:49:41 and about 1,600 feet beyond the runway 08 threshold with vertical and lateral loads of about 1.3 Gs and -0.10 G, respectively. Upon touchdown the captain stated, ""get the power,"" and, 1 second later, ""my aircraft."" The first officer responded, ""your airplane."" The airplane had skipped to an altitude of about 4 feet and touched down again two seconds later about 2,200 feet beyond the runway 08 threshold. The airplane then pitched up to an angle of 9Â° while climbing to an altitude of 37 feet and the engine torque increased from 10 to 43 percent. About 14:49:49, the pitch angle decreased to -3Â°, and the engine torque started to decrease to 20 percent with the pitch angle decreasing to -10Â°. The airplane touched down a third time about 14:49:51 at a bank angle of 7Â° left wing down and about 3,300 feet beyond the runway 08 threshold and with vertical and lateral loads of about 5 Gs and 0.85 G. The ATR pitched up again to 24 feet and landed a fourth time about 14:49:56 (about 15 seconds after the initial touchdown) and about 4,000 feet beyond the runway 08 threshold. This time the airplane pitched down to -7Â° and that it was banked 29Â° left wing down. The airplane came to a complete stop on a grassy area about 217 feet left of the runway centerline and about 4,317 feet beyond the runway threshold.

Each time 9018 kgs of fuel was uplifted in El Obeid while the average fuel consumption for a round trip was 10000 kgs. On the second round trip on May 11, on the leg back to El Obeid, 4201 kgs of fuel remained. The flight departed at 11:40 UTC and climbed to the cruising altitude of FL240. En route all four engines flamed out as a result of a lack of fuel. The propellers were feathered and the aircraft was prepared for a forced landing. The aircraft hit the ground with its nose first and bounced for 15 meters until it collided with trees. Due to high impact force and high rate of descent the wings were twisted. The cockpit section was compressed within the central cargo compartment and a small fire erupted, likely due to electrical shortage within the electrical equipment. There were no survivors. The crew was composed of an Armenian captain and ground engineer, a Sudanese first officer, a Sudanese navigator, a Sudanese radio operator, an Iraqi navigator and an Iraqi flight engineer. The investigation showed that the Sudanese navigator license was expired since July 2001. The Iraqi crew members did not have any valid licenses and their experience on the An-12 dated back from 1994. The aircraft's Certificate of Release to Service and Certificate of Maintenance Review both expired on April 30, 2004. Cause of Accident a) Fuel starvation due to Company fuel planning policy. b) The exhaustion of the Captain as he was handling all flights during the three days preceding the accident flight in addition to the weather on day of accident. c) Some of the crew members had limited experience on the type and three of them even did not fly on AN-12 for a long time which might aggravate the situation before the crash.Sources: akhbaralyoumsd.com  Aviation Letter 451  ICAO Adrep   Location  Images: photo (c) AviaNet Images (www.avianet.de), via Werner Fischdick; Sharjah Airport (SHJ); December 2003 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

During the descent at 1105Z and approximately 1nm from joining overhead the aerodrome for landing on Runway 18 at Phinda Aerodrome, the pilot observed a bird just in front and slightly above the aircraft. He then shouted 'bird'? but at that moment the bird impacted and shattered the co-pilot's windshield. The pilot-in-command immediately took control of the aircraft in order to assess the damage sustained by the bird strike and also the controllability of the aircraft as the co-pilot was dazed and bleeding from his head. The pilot-in-command immediately called Mayday and turned onto left downwind with the aircraft yawing to the right with a loss of airspeed. At that stage, he experienced difficulty in turning the aircraft to the left and required additional power in order to maintain airspeed and rudder input to maintain runway heading. The aircraft landed safely with only a slight bounce. The co-pilot's windshield was found completely shattered, the right-hand wing leading edge was dented at the wing root, headliner and cabin panels broken and seats and interior soiled.

The pilot stated that he was high and fast during the descent into Las Vegas but that the approach was ""stable"" by 500 feet. He stated that he maintained his Vref speed of 112 knots from there until touchdown.  The passenger stated that he felt that the approach was ""fast"" and that the pilot was ""behind the power curve"" because of high minimum enroute altitudes in the area and that they had to ""hustle down"" during the descent. The passenger indicated that the flight crossed the runway threshold ""maybe a bit more"" that 10 knots above Vref and touched down about 10 knots above Vref. He said it was not a stabilized approach. Landing distance calculations and other evidence suggest that the lift dump panels did not extend after landing; however, the investigation did not determine the reason(s) for the lack of lift dump. No evidence was found of any failures affecting the lift dump or braking systems. Evidence and interview statements reveal that the pilot flew an unstabilized approach to the runway and landed well above target speed. The high landing speed was result of the pilot's excessive airspeed on the approach and a tailwind component of about 8 knots. Although the pilot landed the airplane within the touchdown area, the airplane's speed upon touchdown was about 17 knots above the prescribed speed. After exiting the end of runway 7, the airplane continued and impacted a perimeter fence and came to rest approximately 735 feet beyond the end of runway.

It was carrying one pilot and nine passengers. The takeoff, climb out and the initial phase of the flight were normal. About 20 minutes into the flight at FL125 (12500 feet amsl) when the pilot had already made a power reduction and was in the process of trimming the aircraft for level flight, a loud bang was heard that was accompanied by a loss of engine power. The pilot immediately switched on the ignition to no avail. He set the power lever to IDLE, at the same time checking the Ng, which read 0%. The indications from other instruments and the annunciator panel showed that the engine was not running. Efforts to restart the engine failed and the pilot took advantage of the high altitude to circle around in order to find a convenient field for executing a forced landing. The pilot subsequently located a Masai steppe overlooking Loiborsoit village in Simanjiro. After briefing the passengers about the imminent forced landing the pilot made a touch down on a grass field. After rolling for about 400 meters 5H-AXL ran into a terraced field from which maize had been harvested. Tire marks on the ground indicated that it was here that the nose landing gear struck raised lip of earth and sheared from its fuselage attachment point. It subsequently penetrated into the forward baggage pod compartment. The aircraft came to rest some 480 meters beyond the point of initial touch down. The pilot opened the cockpit door and all passengers disembarked safely. There was no fire and there were no injuries.  The aircraft sustained damage to its nose landing gear which separated and the propeller, whose two blades were bent. One of the tubular members of the engine bearer frame was bent and the baggage pod was damaged when it scraped the ground. CAUSE(S): The accident was caused by the aircraft stalling and crashing whilst trying to avoid a truck on the road. The attempt to land on the road was necessitated by the loss of power arising from the engine CT blade(s) failure in flight. The cause of the CT blade(s) failure could not be determined due to severe overheating and impact damage to the blade airfoils. The failure of the pilot to see the landing sight clearly through the wind screen due to the splash of engine oil on the wind screen was a major contributory factor.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIB Tanzania Report number: ACC/14/04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: 2004 Air Accidents / Incidents (Tanzania CAA, AIB)  NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) Eric Groot; Zanzibar-Kisauni Airport (ZNZ/HTZA); 11 August 2011 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

At an height below 100 feet during the final approach, the aircraft was caught by windshear. The flight crew initiated a missed approach procedure during which the tail of the aircraft struck the runway. The aircraft circled and landed safely at 10:31 hours. PROBABLE CAUSE (translated from Italian): A probable and sudden variability in wind direction and intensity (wind shear phenomenon), which occurred below 100 feet, resulteded in a reduction in aircraft speed, which was only partially compensated by the crew. This was followed by a missed approach procedure, during which the rear part of the aircraft impacted the runway, causing damage to the structure of the fuselage. A contributing factor was that the approach was made below the intended path and a late execution of the missed approach manoeuvre.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ANSV Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  22 January 2019 VH-NJZ National Jet Express 0 Sydney-Kingsford Smith International Airport, NSW (SYD/YSSY) non Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were 163 passengers and six crew members on board. Three passengers were slightly injured. JAS Flight 979 took off from Kagoshima Airport at 15:35 and flew to Tokunoshima Airport. On landing at Tokunoshima Airport runway 01, the aircraft's left main landing gear (MLG) collapsed during rollout and its left wing tip contacted the ground. The aircraft came to a stop on the runway. PROBABLE CAUSE: In this accident, it is estimated that due to the left main landing gear cylinder collapsed immediately after the aircraft landed at Tokunoshima Airport, the fuselage inclined to the left and the aircraft traveled with its left wing in contact with the runway surface, resulting substantial damage.  With respect to the collapse of the MLG cylinder, it is considered that Gear Walks which experienced before the restrictor was installed generated large stresses on the fuse section of the cylinder surface and caused micro cracks. The micro cracks are considered to grow during normal operation and eventually lead to the fracture.  Further, it is considered that the presence of surface flaw on the cylinder caused by grit-blast contributed to the crack generation. And the contributing factor to the fact that the company could not detect the cracks on the cylinder by the scheduled maintenance, etc. is considered to be that the manufacturer had not established appropriate inspection intervals or inspection times to detect fatigue cracking.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ARAIC Report number: AA2006-3 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Yomiuri   Location  Images: photo (c) JTSB; Tokunoshima Airport (TKN/RJKN); January 2004 photo (c) JTSB; Tokunoshima Airport (TKN/RJKN); January 2004 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

On board were 135, mostly French, holidaymakers who were heading home.  At 04:38 the flight was cleared to taxi to runway 22R for departure. After takeoff, at 04:42, the plane climbed and maneuvered for a procedural left turn to intercept the 306 radial from the Sharm el-Sheikh VOR station. When the autopilot was engaged the captain made an exclamation and the autopilot was immediately switched off again. The captain then requested Heading Select to be engaged. The plane then began to bank to the right. The copilot then warned the captain a few times about the fact that the bank angle was increasing. At a bank angle of 40 degrees to the right the captain stated ""OK come out"". The ailerons returned briefly to neutral before additional aileron movements commanded an increase in the right bank. The aircraft had reached a maximum altitude of 5460 feet with a 50 degrees bank when the copilot stated: ""Overbank"". Repeating himself as the bank angle kept increasing. The maximum bank angle recorded was 111 degrees right. Pitch attitude at that time was 43 degrees nose down and altitude was 3470 feet. The observer on the flight deck, a trainee copilot, called ""Retard power, retard power, retard power"". Both throttles were moved to idle and the airplane gently seemed to recover from the nose-down, right bank attitude. Speed however increased, causing an overspeed warning. At 04:45 the airplane struck the surface of the water in a 24 degrees right bank, 24 degrees nose-down, at a speed of 416 kts and with a 3,9 G load. The wreckage sank to a depth of approx. 900 metres. CONCLUSION: ""No conclusive evidence could be found from the findings gathered through this investigation to determine the probable cause. However, based on the work done, it could be concluded that any combination of these findings could have caused or contributed to the accident.

A few minutes before 8 o'clock in the morning the crew were cleared to descend from FL280 to FL100. The ice detection system was triggered during descent to FL100. Engine and airframe anti-icing systems were switched on simultaneously. FL100 was reached at 07:59:58 hrs. The pilots stated that they encountered icing conditions when the airplane entered the clouds. At FL100 ice is reported to have formed at the windscreen edges. Vibrations on the no. 2 engine increased temporarily after a flight time of six minutes at FL100. As the airplane was approximately 12.5 NM south of Munich airport, the crew was instructed to descend to FL90 and to change heading to 020 degrees. Heavy vibrations on the no. 2 engine occurred during descent. According to crew statements, the airbrakes were extended in order to increase thrust setting on the engines without increase in airspeed. Immediately afterwards the warning VIB HIGH ENG2 was triggered at FL90. The actions of the Abnormal Procedure Vibration High checklist were carried out. However, the no. 2 engine was not shut down for lack of other failure indications. Afterwards no more problems for the no. 2 engine were indicated. Simultaneously with the strong vibrations, vibrations and noises from the rear cabin area were heard in the cockpit. At 08:08:14 hrs the EPR of the no. 1 engine dropped from 1.5 to 1.1 and stayed at about 1.0 after that. In the cockpit heavy vibrations had been noticed also and a rattling noise had been heard. But the vibrations were not displayed on the multifunctional display as originating from the engines. At 08:08:22 hrs, the captain declared an emergency because of severe engine problems and requested an immediate landing. The airplane was immediately cleared to descend to 5,000 ft based on a QNH of 1,017 hPa and to change to a heading of 080 degrees. The crew requested an approach as short as possible. While leaving FL90, the EPR of the no. 1 engine dropped also from 1.4 to 1.0 within the next four minutes; this EPR reduction was incremental and occurred independent of the thrust setting. At 7,000 ft the air brakes were extended for a short time and engine thrust increased. During the descent to 5,000 ft the airplane was transferred to Munich Director. After 08:12:45 hrs when the airplane had reached approximately 5,000 ft the EPR of the no. 2 engine retained values of about 1.0 also. Munich Director immediately issued a clearance to further descend to 3,500 ft. The air brakes where extended again for a period of 44 seconds. Thereby the airspeed was reduced to approximately 170 kt. With the landing gears extended and the flaps set to 15 degrees, the airspeed was about 150 kt. The airplane was guided to the landing course of the ILS 26L approximately 8 NM in front of the threshold. At approximately 4,000 ft flaps were extended to 25 degrees. After the airplane had descended in landing configuration to the cleared altitude of 3,500 ft and horizontal flight had been established, the crew noticed that by pushing the thrust levers forward, the EPR on both engines did not increase to the required value. The speeds N1 and N2 and the exhaust gas temperatures (EGT) of both engines increased, the EPRs, however, remained at values of around 1.0. After the message of the crew that they were just approaching the ILS the flight was transferred to Munich Tower. Airspeed decreased to approximately 115 kt. The autopilot was immediately switched off, the airplane again established in descent, the flaps reset to 15 degrees and the landing gears retracted. Airspeed increased to approximately 135 kt. The flaps were again set to 25 degrees. The airplane received clearance to land. At 08:16:10 hrs the controller informed the crew that the Fokker was approximately 500 ft below the glide path. At this time the height measured by the radio altimeter was 500 ft AGL. At the same time the GPWS sounded: ""Too low"" and ""Gear"". The crew informed the controller that the runway could not be reached and that the landing would take place approximately 4 NM short of the runway: ""...We will not make it...to the runway...we are touching down probable 4 Miles before the field...""). From approximately 400 ft AGL downwards the airplane was clear of clouds. The landing gear was selected down 13 seconds prior to ground contact. The captain informed the cabin crew of the imminent emergency landing through the repeated exclamation ""Brace for impact"" 5 seconds prior to touch down. At 08:16:35 hrs, the airplane touched down on a snow covered field approximately 2.5 NM short of the runway with landing gears partly extended and came to rest severely damaged lying on the fuselage after a sliding distance of 220 m. All occupants left the airplane without assistance via the forward passenger door exit. The accident was due to the following immediate causes: - After a prolonged time under moderate icing conditions and low engine thrust, ice developed on the rotors of the low pressure compressors of both engines. - The bonded joints of the ice impact panels on both engines failed due to strains caused by ice-induced vibrations of the engines and by ice which had shedded from the rotors of the low pressure compressor. - The loose ice impact panels became trapped in front of the outlet guide vanes of the low pressure compressor and affected the airflow in the by-pass duct in such a way that the engines now only produced low thrust. - The runway was no longer within reach of the aircraft as the loss of thrust on both engines had not triggered any warnings and was not indicated until the necessary demand of thrust at an altitude of 3,500 ft. - Due to its nature the terrain within reach was not suited for the landing of a transport airplane.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BFU Report number: BFU AX001-0/04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   Austrian Airlines  BFU History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  26 March 2024 5Y-MMB unknown 0 Nairobi-Wilson Airport (WIL/HKNW) non Taxiway excursion Images: photo (c) Vuxi; near MÃ¼nchen; January 2004; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) Werner Fischdick; DÃ¼sseldorf Airport (DUS); 28 September 2002 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

This caused the aircraft to pivot so that it's nose went through the hangar door before it came to a stop. The crew reported that as they were making a left turn, nose-wheel steering became insufficient as the turn tightened. To compensate, a small amount of brake pressure was was applied on the left wheel. The captain felt that this amount of braking was inadequate, so maximum brake pressure was applied on the left wheel. This had no effect, resulting in the collision with the hangar. The emergency braking system was not used. Of the two crew and six passengers, three of the passengers reported neck problems. Upon investigation, no defects were found in the braking system, and it is unknown whether the antilock braking system activated during the event. According to the aircraft manufacturer, it is possible that the degraded turn performance was a result of the left wheel locking up. The surface was wet from rainfall, and the tight left turn would reduce weight on the left wheel. Both of these factors decrease traction, increasing the likelihood of the left wheel locking up. Although it was not determined if the brakes were tested before commencing the taxi, the Dutch Safety Board reccomended that testing of the brakes always be carried out before taxiing. This gives an earlier opportunity for the crew to activate the emergency braking system.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Dutch Safety Board Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: Dutch Safety Board Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates25-Sep-2020 15:13 ASN Update Bot Added 25-May-2022 05:29 harro Updated [Total fatalities, Other fatalities, Damage, ]13-Jun-2022 20:22 Ron Averes Updated [Location, ]12-Oct-2024 14:52 Justanormalperson Updated [Operator, Destination airport, ] Corrections or additions? ...

Weather was poor as the flight approached the airport. After reporting capturing the glideslope the air traffic controller reported a vertical visibility of 60 m and a runway visual range of 1300 m. About 12,5 km out, the aircraft's rate of descent increased, causing it to descend below the glideslope. The rate of descent was arrested at a height of 170 m, 8 km from the threshold of runway 08L and they continued in level flight. At the Outer Marker (3,5 km from the runway) they should have started their initial approach, but the crew continued level flight thus flying above the glideslope now. With 2,5 km to go the airplane descended slightly at 1-1,5 m/sec. At the Inner Marker the descent rate increased to 2-2,6 m/sec. The crew then probably saw the runway lights below them. The engines were brought back to idle and reverse thrust was applied at a height of 60 m. When it appeared that they would not be able to land given the remaining runway length, reverse thrust was deselected and engine power was increased. At that point the airplane touched down 260 m past the end of the runway. It continued until the right wing struck a concrete building. The plane then lost the left wing before it crashed through a concrete wall. The airplane broke up, crashed into a ditch and caught fire.METAR: 14:00 UTC / 19:00 local time: UTTT 131400Z 23003MPS 180V250 0350 R08L/0900N FG VV001 01/01 Q1026 TEMPO 0200 FG VV001 08CLRD70=15:00 UTC / 20:00 local time: UTTT 131500Z 22002MPS 0200 R08L/0600N FG VV001 01/01 Q1026 NOSIG 08CLRD70= Sources: ITAR-TASS  NTV  Russian Ministry of Transport letter 02.04.2004 No. 22.15-412  RIA Novosti   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

At 15:55, the aircraft was de-iced and departed ten minutes later. The aircraft landed at 16:20. While on the ramp, two individuals voiced concern to the pilot that there was ice on the wing. Freezing precipitation was falling. The pilot was observed to visually check the leading edge of the wing; however, he did not voice any concern and proceeded with loading the passengers and cargo. At approximately 16:38, flight GGN126 departed Pelee Island for Windsor. After using most of the runway length for takeoff, the aircraft climbed out at a very shallow angle. The pilot raised the flaps while over Lake Erie. The Caravan then entered an aerodynamic stall. Because the plane was rolling into a climbing right turn, the left wing stalled first. The nose dropped and the airplane rolled to the left. The airplane was too low for recovery and struck the ice. It was determined that the aircraft was overweight by 1270 pounds (576 kg) when it departed Pelee Island. The maximum takeoff weight for this flight was 8550 pounds (3878 kg). FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1. At take-off, the weight of the aircraft exceeded the maximum allowable gross take-off weight by at least 15 per cent, and the aircraft was contaminated with ice. Therefore, the aircraft was being flown significantly outside the limitations under which it was certified for safe flight. 2. The aircraft stalled, most likely when the flaps were retracted, at an altitude or under flight conditions that precluded recovery before it struck the ice surface of the lake. 3. On this flight, the pilot's lack of appreciation for the known hazards associated with the overweight condition of the aircraft, ice contamination, and the weather conditions was inconsistent with his previous practices. His decision to take off was likely adversely affected by some combination of stress and fatigue.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A04H0001 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   TSB  Transport Canada   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The captain stated that he had turned on all the lights required by the operating procedures (position lights, anti-collision light) and that he had also turned on the taxi lights. While the aircraft was traveling along taxiway NG, just before arriving abeam apron D, a blow was felt coming from the front left of the aircraft. The blow had been produced by the collision with a passenger bus, which had invaded the taxiway along a rolling road that crossed taxiway NG from left to right (with respect to the route of the aircraft).  There were no injuries. The Metro suffered substantial damage to the left hand wing tip. PROBABLE CAUSE (translated from Italian):  The accident was caused by the presence of a passenger bus inside the airport grounds on the taxiway used by an aircraft at the same time.  Among the factors that contributed to the event was the situation of poor visibility, determined by the light conditions (21.07 local time), the weather conditions, the position of the ""STOP"" signal too far back to have a good view of the traffic moving on the TWY, the artifacts in the area of the event. The above situation - probably not considered during the training phase of the airport drivers - led to the failure of the passenger vehicle to comply with the regulations contained in the DCA ordinance no. 24/98 (a taxiing aircraft always takes precedence over any vehicle circulating at the airport).Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ANSV Report number: A/35/04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  8 January 1982 HB-LNB Crossair 0 ZÃ¼rich-Kloten Airport (ZRH) min Runway excursion Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The copilot was Pilot Flying. The Beech took off at 20:30 and arrived near GhardaÃ¯a fourteen minutes later.  At 20:44 the flight was cleared for a right hand circuit in preparation for an approach to runway 30. At that moment a Boeing 727 was on long finals. The copilot stated that he intended to carry out an NDB/ILS approach to runway 30. The captain however preferred a visual approach. The copilot carried out the captain's course and descent instructions with hesitation. At 20:57, the EGPWS alarm sounded. Power was added and a climb was initiated from a lowest altitude of 240 feet above ground level. The captain then took over control and assumed the role of Pilot Flying. The airplane manoeuvred south of the airport until 21:01 when the copilot saw the runway. The captain rolled left to -57Â° and pitched down to -18.9Â° in order to steer the airplane towards the runway. Again the EGPWS sounded but the descent continued until the airplane impacted the ground and broke up. The five occupants survived the impact, but the co-pilot died a day later of his injuries. Causes of the accident (translated from French): The Commission believes that the accident can be explained by a series of several causes which, taken separately, would not lead to an accident. The causes are related to: 1 - the lack of rigor in the approach and landing phase evidenced by a failure to follow standard operating procedures, including the arrival checklist. 2 - the failure to strictly comply with the holding, approach and landing procedures in force for the aerodrome of GhardaÃ¯a. 3 - the fact that the captain seemed occupied by the visual search maneuvers that put him temporarily out of the control loop. He was so focused on the visual search for the runway and abandoned the monitoring of parameters that are critical for the safety of the flight. This concentration completely disoriented him. 4 - the fact that the crew did not respond appropriately to different alarms that occurred, indicating a lack of control in the operation of the aircraft in that kind of situation. Lack of control was apparently due to his lack of training on this aircraft type. 5 - The activities in the southern part of Algeria may cause a certain routine that can promote the tendency to conduct visual approaches. It seems, indeed, that the crew is more experienced in visual flights. 6 - A lack of coordination and communication between the crew members flying together for the first time.Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) Archives; Hassi Messaoud-Oued Irara Airport (HME); January 2004 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane was operated by Phoenix Aviation and chartered by ExpoAir. Using GPS and DME the airplane approached Colombo. The approach controller cleared flight 3002 to descend to FL150. After reaching that altitude the navigator passed on the QNH and QFE values for Colombo: 1009 mb and 756 mm Hg. The altimeters were updated with this information. However, the copilot erroneously programmed 765 mm Hg into the altimeter. After turning left onto finals the aircraft, 14 km from the runway, descended to an altitude above sea level of 60 meters. The airplane descended slowly until the landing gear contacted the surface of the sea at a distance of 10,7 km short of runway 04. Climb power was applied and the navigator reported that they were going around: ""PHG 3-0-0-2 go around, again I call you established localizer"". At a height of 60-90 meters however, the captain decided to continue the approach. Assuming the undercarriage had been substantially damaged, he decided to carry out a belly landing on the side of the runway. Touchdown was accomplished 50 meters to the right of the runway and 450 meters passed the threshold. The aircraft skidded and came to rest 2230 meters further on. The Ilyushin was away and parked in a corner of the airport, where it was still noted in May 2004.Sources: Information on the aviation incident with the aircraft IL-18D EX-005 / Russian Ministry of Transport   Location  Images: photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Sharjah Airport (SHJ); December 2002 photo (c) Aktug Ates; Antalya Airport (AYT); 06 May 2001 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates25-Nov-2024 14:45 ASN Updated [Operator, ]25-Nov-2024 14:45 ASN Updated [Location, Destination airport, ]25-Nov-2024 14:45 ASN Updated [Damage, ]10-Feb-2025 08:32 ASN Updated [Location, ]10-Feb-2025 08:33 ASN Updated [Destination airport, ]24-Feb-2025 19:11 ASN Updated [Operator, Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Following some upper level air work, the crew requested, and were granted a clearance for, a simulated engine failure and descent to 2,000 ft. The pilot in command retarded the power lever to the flight idle stop and the fuel condition lever to the low idle range, setting a value of 55% engine gas generator speed (Ng). The pilot under training then set the glide attitude at the best glide speed of about 79 knots indicated airspeed and feather the propeller The PIC reported that he instructed the pilot under training to advance the emergency power lever (EPL) to simulate manual introduction of fuel to the engine. He then noticed that there was no engine torque increase, with the engine inter-turbine temperature (ITT or T5) and Ng rapidly decreasing, and a strong smell of fuel in the cockpit. Despite several efforts to relight the engine, they were not successful. They then completed a successful landing in a depth of about 2 m of water near Green Island. The aircraft sustained minor damage during the ditching, but subsequent substantial damage due to salt water immersion. SIGNIFICANT FACTORS:  1. The pilots of CYC were conducting in-flight familiarization training using the emergency power lever. That procedure was not contained in the aircraft manufacturerÂs pilot operating handbook. 2. The engine manufacturerÂs documentation contained information on the use of the emergency power lever, which did not preclude the use of the emergency power lever for in-flight familiarization training. 3. The engine sustained a flameout at an altitude above mean sea level from which reignition of the engine was not successfully completed. 4. Erosion of the first-stage compressor blades would have reduced the aerodynamic efficiency of the compressor blades.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ATSB Report number: ATSB Occurrence 200400443 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: ATSB History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  12 March 1999 VH-CYC 0 4 km N Cairns Airport non Location  Images: photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Cairns Airport, QLD (CNS/YBCS); April 1997 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

A Fokker 50 passenger plane, operated by Kish Air, was destroyed when it crashed near Sharjah Airport (SHJ), United Arab Emirates. All six crew members and 37 of the 40 passengers were killed. The aircraft was operating as a scheduled flight from Kish Island, Iran to Sharjah, UAE with the captain initially as the pilot flying (PF).  During the cruise and just prior to descent, the captain unexpectedly handed over control of the aircraft to the First Officer prior to the approach to Sharjah. The first officer did not accept this willingly and stated that he was not confident of his ability to conduct a VOR/DME approach into Sharjah. This statement was not consistent with his previous experience and could indicate either a cultural or professional issue. The captain insisted the first officer fly the aircraft and encouraged and instructed him during the approach.  At 11:24 hours local time, the aircraft contacted Dubai Arrivals and was cleared from 9000 ft to 5000 ft and instructed to expect a VOR/DME approach to runway 12 at Sharjah International Airport. At 11:29 hours the aircraft was further cleared to 2500 ft and cleared for the approach. The aircraft was under its own navigation and the daylight conditions were fine with excellent visibility. At 11:35 hours the aircraft was instructed to contact Sharjah Tower and the pilot reported that the aircraft was established on the VOR final approach for runway 12. The Tower cleared IRK7170 to land and advised that the wind was calm.  At that point the aircraft was slightly above the approach profile. The initial speed for the approach was at least 50 kt high at approximately 190 kt with no flap and no landing gear. The aircraft should have been configured with landing gear down and flap 10Â° during the approach and stabilized at 130 kt prior to the MDA. Approaching the MDA at flight idle setting, the auto-pilot was disengaged and the first Officer called for flap 10 at 186 kt (limiting speed of 180 kt) and flap 25 was selected by the Captain, a setting uncalled for by the Pilot Flying at 183 kt (limiting speed of 160 kt), and the landing gear was called for and selected at approximately 185 kt (limiting speed of 170 kt). The captain then took control of the aircraft and shortly afterwards the ground range selectors were heard by Cockpit Voice Recorder to be lifted and the power levers moved from the flight idle stop into the ground control range.  The left propeller then went to full reverse whilst the right propeller remained in positive pitch within the ground control range. The aircraft descended in an extreme nose low left bank attitude until impact. The aircraft crashed 2.6 nm from the runway onto an unprepared sandy area adjacent to a road and residential buildings. The aircraft broke apart on impact and a fire started immediately. Cause:  The power levers were moved by a pilot from the flight idle position into the ground control range, which led to an irreversible loss of flight control.  Contributory Causes: 1. By suddenly insisting the First Officer fly the final approach, the pilot in command created an environment, which led to a breakdown of crew resource management processes, the non observance of the operatorÂs standard operating procedures and a resultant excessive high approach speed.  2. An attempt to rectify this excessive high approach speed most likely resulted in the non compliance with the Standard Operating Procedures and the movement of the power levers below flight idle.  3.  The unmodified version of the Skid Control Unit failed to provide adequate protection at the time of the event.Sources: SKYbraryÂ   GulfNews  ICAO Adrep  Kish Air crash due to human factors: probe (Khaleej Times, 20 April 2006)  BBC, IRNA   Location  Images: photo (c) ; Sharjah Airport (SHJ); February 2004 photo (c) ; Sharjah Airport (SHJ); February 2004 photo (c) Dmitry Avdeev; Sharjah Airport (SHJ); 12 January 2005; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) Ger Buskermolen; Sharjah Airport (SHJ); 09 February 2004 photo (c) Heinz Rentmeister; Sharjah Airport (SHJ); 09 February 2004 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates03-Jan-2025 12:21 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The shimmying stopped when braking was reduced but restarted when braking was increased, causing the torsion link to fracture. Further higher amplitude shimmying of the left MLG ensued, resulting in severe MLG tyre, wheel and brake damage and substantial oscillatory loads on the aircraft structure. Steering difficulties were experienced during both shimmying episodes. It was likely that the shimmying resulted from excessive wear of the torsion link apex joint that reduced the effectiveness of the shimmy damper. Maintenance records indicated that the MLG had been maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations, but it was considered that relevant Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) procedures could be difficult to follow.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: EW/C2004/02/03 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: AAIB Bulletin 4/2005 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  3 June 2009 VP-BXM Aeroflot-Nord 0 Simferopol Airport (SIP) sub Images: photo (c) AAIB; 21 February 2004 photo (c) Ian Jenkins; London-Heathrow Airport (LHR/EGLL) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Both airplanes sustained substantial damage.  The 2 flight crewmembers, 1 cabin crewmember, and 29 passengers were uninjured.  Dark night visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.  The Push Tug Operator stated, ""In pushing back this plane I was attempting to do it as I was trained, that is, to [prop] the front wheels on the painted line.  I [normally] work on the east side and there is a line [used] for the front wheels.  I had not done [a] push back [on] the west side before.

ASSESS ROUTE, CLEARANCES AND RAMP CONDITIONS.""  The Push Tug Operator tested positive for cocaine metabolite.  14 CFR Part 121 Appendix I stated, ""Each person who performs a safety-sensitive function directly or by contract for an employer must be tested pursuant to an FAA-approved antidrug program conducted in accordance with this appendix.""  The Push Tug Operator was not on the FAA's safety-sensitive list.  An airline representative reported that the airline's policy is to accomplish a pre-employment drug test for all safety-sensitive and non safety-sensitive employees.  The Push Tug Operator's pre-employment drug test was reported as negative.  The airline had a drug policy and an employee assistance program in-place at the time of the accident.  An airline representative reported that the supervisor and coordinator for the accident gate area were two gates away and did not directly observe the accident pushback.  Subsequent to the accident, the airline established a policy of random drug testing for all employees as a condition of employment. Probable Cause: The visual lookout not maintained and the procedures not followed by the  Push Tug Operator during the pushback.  Factors were the parked airplane, the dark night, and the inadequate surveillance of the pushback by airline management.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CHI04LA077 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB CHI04LA077 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates12-Oct-2022 15:00 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

The airplane was on approach to Cagliari-Elmas Airport (CAG) following a domestic flight from Roma-Ciampino Airport (CIA).  On the evening of 23 February 2004, the Austrian air taxi operator City-jet was requested to carry out a flight from Cagliari-Elmas Airport (CAG), Sardinia, Italy to Roma-Ciampino Airport (CIA) and return.  The purpose of the flight was to transport a team of three doctors to Rome who would need to remove a organ for transplantation. The crew would wait at the airport to return to Cagliari with the medical staff and the organ.  CIT Flight 123 took off from Milan Linate at 22:22 and landed at Cagliari without incident at 00:02, February 24. After refueling (1100 liters) and the three passengers had boarded, the aircraft departed at 01:01 bound for Rome, where it landed at 01:51.  After arriving at Ciampino Airport, the crew filed an IFR flight plan for Cagliari, alternate Olbia, call sign CIT 124, with Estimated Off-Block Time (EOBT) 04:00. The flight was declared STS/HOSP (medical flight).  After arrival of the medical team, takeoff occurred at 05:00. The aircraft was authorized by Rome ACC to directly enter the airway M126, without carrying out the standard instrument departure. The en route part of the flight to Cagliari was uneventful.  At 05.37, Rome ACC instructed flight 124 to contact Cagliari APP, After radio contact was established , Cagliari APP provided the weather at the aerodrome: runway in use 32, wind 7 knots from 320Â°, visibility 12 km scattered clouds at 2000 feet, temperature 10Â° C, dew point 9Â° C, QNH 1012. At 05.41.12, Cagliari APP instructed CIT 124, which at that time was at the waypoint Aledo, to continue the descent over the next waypoint LEDRO up to 5000 feet, to carry out the ILS procedure for a landing on runway 32 and report at Carbonara VOR. The commander, reading back the instructions, requested permission to conduct a visual approach should he obtain visual contact with the airport: ""Roger, we are cleared now to descend to five thousand feet on the QNH one zero one two and we passing Ledro cleared by ILS three two papa and if we have field visually, we would like to have a visual approach."" This was confirmed by Cagliari APP. At 05:43 the flight crew radioed: ""CIT 124, we have the field in sight requesting visual approach."" At that time the aircraft was at FL 96, about 28 nm from Carbonara VOR and about 41 nm from Cagliari VOR. Cagliari APP then asked CIT 124 about the ability to maintain obstacle clearance: ""confirm able to maintain your own separation from the obstacles sir, performing visual approach runway three two"". The pilot just replied: ""affirmative, CIT 124"". About three minutes later, Cagliari APP informed CIT 124 to continue the descent without descending below 2500 feet and contact Elmas TWR for the further descent: ""[...] CIT 124 continue not below 2500 feet, further descent with Elmas Tower 120.6 bye"" The pilot contacted Elmas TWR at 05:47: ""Elmas Tower, buongiorno, CIT 124, visual, left procedure, for visual approach runway 32."" Elmas TWR responded by reporting the runway in use (32), wind conditions (8 knots from 310Â°), and told the flight to report on short final for runway 32. This was read back by the crew.  Two minutes later, while descending over mountainous terrain, flight 124 collided with the side of Su Baccu Malu Mountain (3333 feet). CAUSA E FATTORI CONTRIBUTIVI LÂincidente, classificabile come CFIT, Ã¨ stato causato dalla conduzione del volo ad una quota significativamente inferiore allÂaltitudine minima di settore, insufficiente a mantenere la separazione dal terreno, durante un avvicinamento a vista notturno in assenza di adeguati riferimenti visivi.  Sono stati individuati i seguenti possibili fattori contributivi dellÂincidente: - strumentazione dellÂaeromobile non comprendente uno strumento GPWS o TAWS, la cui installazione non Ã¨ richiesta dalla normativa; - lÂassunzione da parte dellÂequipaggio di riferimenti visivi erronei, confusi con le luci pista di Elmas, tenuto conto che lÂequipaggio non aveva particolare familiaritÃ  con la zona di Cagliari; lÂinsorgenza, nellÂequipaggio, di fenomeni di illusione ottica, con specifico riferimento al cosiddetto ""black hole approach""; - il fraintendimento, da parte dellÂequipaggio, dellÂistruzione data da Cagliari APP allÂatto del trasferimento a Elmas TWR (""CIT 124 continue not below 2500 feet, further descent with Elmas TWR 120.6 bye""), che potrebbe aver ingenerato il convincimento, malgrado lo stesso equipaggio avesse confermato di essere in grado di separarsi autonomamente dagli ostacoli, che la discesa fino a quella quota fosse libera da ostacoli; - mancato utilizzo delle procedure strumentali pubblicate e disponibili nella conduzione di avvicinamento su di un aeroporto e in unÂarea non conosciuti, in condizioni di totale oscuritÃ ; - lÂanticipazione della deviazione dallÂaerovia, forse decisa per cercare di accelerare lÂarrivo a destinazione, che ha determinato il sorvolo di aree di maggiore elevazione; - errori di lettura delle quote riportate nelle carte consultate, facilitati dalla mancata rappresentazione a colori del terreno; - il prolungato periodo di veglia senza adeguato riposo, che potrebbe aver contribuito a ridurre la performance dellÂequipaggio. translated from the original Italian text: CAUSE AND CONTRIBUTORY FACTORS The accident, classified as CFIT, was caused by the conduct of the flight at a height significantly below the Area Minimum Altitude, insufficient to maintain the separation from the ground during a night visual approach in the absence of adequate visual reference. possible contributory factors that have been identified: - The aircraft instrumentation did not include a GPWS or TAWS, whose installation is not required by law; - The erroneous descent by visual flight references, confusing the Elmas runway lights, given that the crew had no special familiarity with the area of Cagliari, the onset of a perspective illusions phenomena, with specific reference to the so-called ""black hole approach""; - The misunderstanding by crew members, of the Cagliari Approach controllers instruction to transfer to Elmas TWR (""CIT 124 continue not below 2500 feet, further descent with Elmas TWR 120.6 bye "") which may have created the impression, despite the crew had confirmed that they are able to separate themselves from the obstacles that the descent down was free of obstructions; - Failure to use published procedures and available instruments in a descent to a closer airport and in an unfamiliar area , under conditions of total darkness; - The anticipation of the deviation from the airway perhaps caused [the crew] to try to speed up the arrival at destination, which determined overflying areas of higher elevation; - Read errors of the elevations listed in the maps consulted, facilitated by the non representation of the ground color; - The extended period of wakefulness without adequate rest, which may have contributed to a reduction in the performance of the crew.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ANSV Report number: ANSV report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   ANSV   Location  Images: photo (c) Werner Fischdick; DÃ¼sseldorf Airport (DUS); 22 April 1985 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft diverted its course to Las Palmas airport, where the seriously injured passenger with signs of hemiplegia was disembarked to be taken to a hospital for medical assistance. There was no forecast turbulence in the area where the accident occurred. There were no visible clouds. No turbulence announcements were given and the fasten seat belt signs remained off. Causes The accident was caused by the penetration of the aircraft in an area of turbulence when passengers were not secured with their seat belts. The seat belt signs were not lit, because turbulence was not expected.

The airplane carried Macedonian President Boris Trajkovski and other officials. All aboard were killed in the accident. Based on the investigation and analysis of the collected evidence and documents available, the Commission concluded that the immediate cause of the aircraft accident of Beechcraft Super King Air 200 registration Z3-BAB was the following: Descending below the minimum descent altitude-MDA of 1810 feet for the published procedure for precision approach for landing at the airport in Mostar: 1:06 Mostar-LQMO, VOR/DME RWY 34 (Jeppesen 13-1), resulting in a Controlled Flight Into Terrain-CFIT. The main factors that have led to a descent below the minimum published heights are as follows: a) Very poor quality and lack of preparation of the crew for the approach and landing; b) Ignoring the information of air traffic controllers on the current meteorological situation at LQMO Airport; c) Wrong determination of the FAF (Final Approach Final Fix- point of access) and its replacement with the IAF (Intermediate Approach Fix- Central point of access) which led to an earlier start of the descent. d) To turn off the autopilot during the approach phase, taking into account the complex meteorological situation; e) Low crew teamwork (CRM Crew Resource Management) - lack of communication and failure to follow standard operating procedures; f) Failure to maintain level flight by Pilot Flying and inadequate response by pilots Assisting Pilot, at the stage of reaching the MDA Minimum Descent Altitude.METAR: 07:00 UTC / 08:00 local time:Wind from 340Â° at 10 kts; Visibility: 8 km; Scattered clouds at 600 feet; Broken clouds at 1600 feet and 7300 feet; Temperature: 5Â° C; Pressure: 1003 mbAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: MKT Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 10 years and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) Karl KrÃ¤mer, via Werner Fischdick; MÃ¼nchen-Franz Josef Strauss Airport (MUC/EDDM); February 2000 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The captain reported the seat belt sign was turned on as they descended through 18,000 feet.  He reported they encountered about 15 seconds of moderate turbulence as they passed through 16,000 feet.  He reported there were no weather returns in the area and they were back in smooth air after the encounter.  The first officer reported that he informed the flight attendants to take their seats as soon as they began to encounter the turbulence.  He reported he was getting ready to call the flight attendants after the turbulence to make sure they were alright, when the cockpit received a call from the back stating that one of the flight attendants injured her ankle.  The first officer reported that they requested paramedics meet the flight upon landing.  The injured flight attendant reported she was in the aft galley when they encountered the turbulence.  She stated she tried to get in the jumpseat, but was unable to because of the turbulence.  The injured flight attendant stated she heard another flight attendant tell a passenger who was in the aft galley to sit on the floor, so she decided to do the same.  She stated that as she was sitting down, the ""plane dropped"" and she fell.  Once the turbulence subsided, the other flight attendant and a passenger helped her off the floor and into a seat.  None of the flight attendants recalled having any advance warning of the turbulence.  Rapidly building convective activity was evident along the upper Mississippi Valley at the time of the accident.  Convective tops averaging FL250 in the area were moving north-northeast at 60 knots.  Severe Weather Advisory 15S, valid from 1731 universal coordinated time (UTC) to 2301 UTC, covered the route of flight from the Mississippi River to ORD.  The severe thunderstorm watch included a forecast for hail, surface wind gusts to 60 knots, maximum cloud tops to FL450, and a storm motion vector to 240 degrees at 35 knots.  Convective Sigmet 25C was valid until 2255UTC.  The Sigmet called for an area of embedded thunderstorms moving from 190 degrees at 20 knots.  The thunderstorms had tops to FL300.  Data from the digital flight data recorder shows the airplane experienced vertical acceleration fluctuations from a minimum of 0.437 g's, to a maximum of 1.994 g's, and back to 0.576 g's in less then 3 seconds.    Probable Cause: The unexpected encounter with convective turbulence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CHI04LA084 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB CHI04LA084  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates25-Mar-2024 10:01 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

In Ankara the airplane was loaded with 39980 kg of cargo. The next stop was Baku, Azerbaijan for refueling. The airplane took 47 tons of fuel, bringing the takeoff weight to 189 tons, and the centre of gravity to 29,3% MAC, which was within the prescribed limits. During the eight-hour stopover the crew decided to rest in the aircraft instead of a hotel. As the aircraft started taxiing to the runway the flight engineer was heard saying that he would select the flaps at 30 degrees and slats at 14 degrees for takeoff. This however was not done. Prior to takeoff the position of the flaps was not verified by any of the crew members. Takeoff was thus commenced with flaps and slats retracted and the stabilizer trimmed at the takeoff position -4 degrees (corresponding to actual takeoff weight, CofG and flaps at 30Â°). At a speed of 210 km/h the pilot pulled on the control column to lift off the nose gear. At a calculated unstick speed of 265 km/h the angle of attack reached 9 degrees but the plane did not lift off the runway. Accelerating through 290 km/h the angle of attack of the aircraft reached 14,5 degrees, setting off the angle of attack warning on the flight deck. Some 1750 meters down the runway, the aft fuselage struck the runway. Seventy meters further on, at a speed of 300 km/h and an angle of attack of 19,4Â°, the Ilyushin lifted off the runway. The air traffic controller who witnessed the departure advised the crew to abort the takeoff, but the captain apparently continued. The airplane rolled to the left until the wing contacted the runway. Then the flight engineer noted his error and, without informing the captain, began extending the flaps and slats. Again without informing the captain, the flight engineer brought back the power levers of the four engines to idle. After three seconds he moved them from idle to the 'engine shutdown' position. The captain three times yelled ""takeoff"" but the engines were already shut down. After flying for 490 meters the aircraft struck the ground and crashed.Sources: Information on the aviation incident with the aircraft Il-76TD UR-ZVA / Russian Ministry of Transport No. 22.15-568  MAK Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC)  RIA Novosti   Location  Images: photo (c) Oliver KÃ¶stinger; Sharjah Airport (SHJ/OMSJ) photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Oostende Airport (OST/EBOS); March 1995 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

After 01:20 of flight, the instruction phase for the first trainee was completed. When the Canadair stopped on the lake, the two co-pilots switched places. The second trainee took the controls and began his training session with hydroplaning in accordance with the training program. Before starting the next exercise, the instructor reminded the trainee of the actions to be taken to achieve this phenomenon. He reminded that the speed must remain below 55 kt.  The trainee, still at the controls, extended the flaps to 10Â°, the takeoff configuration. He then proceeded to accelerate the aircraft by advancing the throttle to obtain an engine torque close to that required for takeoff. As the Canadair accelerated, the trainee applied elevator to initiate the porpoise. The airspeed continued to increase and the Canadair took off without the porpoising phenomenon having occurred. The trainee moved the power levers to minimum. The aircraft struck the water and the crew felt a shock. As the aircraft continued to move through the water in deceleration, the instructor pointed out to the trainee the loss of the right-hand float. The instructor decided to abort the training mission and took over the controls to return to the Marseille-Provence Airport. The instructor then undertook to take off. As soon as the aircraft took off, it slowly tilted to the right even though the control column was positioned to the left. The instructor then positioned the control column to the left, but the bank continued to increase. The instructor told the two co-pilots that he was having difficulty controlling the aircraft. The co-pilot trainee, sitting in the middle seat, suggested switching to manual control. The instructor did not accept this option and put the aircraft in descent. He asked the trainee in the right seat to put the flaps in the 25Â° position which corresponded to the landing configuration. The aircraft, still banked and descending, hit the water with its right wing. The instructor and the trainee in the center seat died. The trainee in training was seriously injured. CAUSES OF THE ACCIDENT  (translation from French report) The accident is the consequence of a chain of causes of human origin which lead to the loss of control in roll of the aircraft:  The accident can be broken down into 2 phases:   - A first phase that leads to the damage of the flight controls during the impact with the water following the stall of the aircraft. The stall is the result of the trainee's failure to execute the flight controls, which was not countered by the instructor. The trainee's failure to perform at the very beginning of Canadair training was part of a context of:  -- a failure to comply with the training framework: Contrary to what the progression booklet states, the instructor did not demonstrate the porpoising. He entrusted the commands to the trainee.  -- pedagogical error: The instructor did not follow a trainee who was performing an exercise for the first time.  -- lack of control of the parameters (speed) by the crew.   - A second phase that lead to the loss of the aircraft and part of its crew. It resulte from an underestimation of the damage to the aircraft during the impact with the water and from the decision of the captain to take off without checking the flight controls.   It is common practice for crews to continue flying loss of a float during a scoop. The instructor assimilated the circumstances of the float loss he was confronted with to those already encountered during scooping operations. He proceeded with the takeoff without checking the flight controls that were damaged during the stall.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEAD Report number: BEAD-air-S-2004-006-A Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Air Forces Monthly, May 2004   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The nose wheel steering was inoperative and had been deferred in accordance with the operator's Minimum Equipment List (MEL).  In that situation, the nose wheel was in the ""free castor mode.""  The MEL states that directional control is to be maintained by using brakes and differential power.  The pilot reported that the landing touch down was on the centerline, however, shortly afterward the aircraft encountered an ""overwhelming"" wind gust which caused it to weathervane to the left.  He reported that he applied full right rudder and differential right braking which was effective in stopping the aircraft's drift.  However, the aircraft encountered a second ""much stronger and sustained"" gust, which caused the aircraft to ""veer strongly to the left.""  His subsequent efforts to maintain directional control through the use of differential braking and differential engine thrust were insufficient to keep the aircraft from departing the runway pavement.  The aircraft came to rest in the soft grass adjacent to the runway.  The pilot attempted to taxi back onto the runway, however, the nose wheel contacted the edge of the pavement and collapsed.  Distinct ruts were observed in the soft turf adjacent to the left side of the runway.  The nose wheel tire track approached the edge of the pavement at approximately a 20-degree angle and terminated at the edge of the runway.  The track was approximately eight inches deep relative to the level of the runway pavement.  The published maximum demonstrated crosswind component for the aircraft was 22 knots.  The operator did not impose a crosswind component limitation on operations in general or on operations with the nose wheel steering inoperative under the MEL.  Surface winds provided to the flight crew by the control tower were 310 degrees at 23 knots, gusting to 30 knots. Probable Cause: The captain's improper decision due to his attempt to taxi back onto the runway after coming to a stop in the grass, and the resulting collapse of nose landing gear.  Contributing factors were the inoperative nose wheel steering, the pilot's inability to maintain directional control during the landing roll due to the crosswind, and the high crosswind component.  Additional factors were the uneven transition between the grass and the runway pavement, as well as the soft grass.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CHI04LA086 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: NTSB: https://www.ntsb.gov/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/brief.aspx?ev_id=20040319X00351&key=1  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates23-Feb-2015 14:52 Noro Added 21-Dec-2016 19:28 ASN Update Bot Updated [Time, Damage, Category, Investigating agency, ]07-Dec-2017 17:48 ASN Update Bot Updated [Operator, Other fatalities, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

It departed at 03:43 for Tonopah. After reporting the runway lights in sight, the pilot configured the airplane for the approach and initiated a circling maneuver to the right for a visual straight-in approach to runway 32. During the turn the pilot suffered a sudden cardiac death. Half way through the turn the airplane began a gradual descent until it impacted the ground. The airplane broke up and burst into flames. Investigation revealed that the pilot had violated federal policy and directives, wilfully deceived flight medical examiners, suppressed significant medical information and ingested inappropriate medications for a deteriorating and dangerous health condition. The pilot had high blood pressure and failed to report it, and denied taking medications to his Federal Aviation Administration flight physical examiners. According to the Air Force Materiel Command Accident Investigation Board report, the pilot became incapacitated during his approach to land due to sudden cardiac death.Sources: AFMC News Service Release 0743  Executive Summary Beechcraft 1900C, UB37, N27RA accident  (USAF)  Las Vegas Review-Journal   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

The flight continued to Darwin with the landing gear extended. During approach to Darwin airport the pilot advised air traffic control that he could not obtain a green 'down and locked' indication for the left main landing gear, and declared an emergency prior to landing. During touchdown, the left main landing gear collapsed and the aircraft slewed off the runway. Both occupants evacuated the aircraft with no injuries. The aircraft operator's maintenance organisation examined the aircraft and found that the left main landing gear drive shaft had severed as a result of fretting against a bleed air duct clamp tail. The bleed air duct clamp (jubilee clamp) had been fitted to the aircraft during an aircraft refurbishment program in September 2003. The jubilee clamp tail had been fastened in close proximity to the landing gear drive shaft. Subsequently, the jubilee clamp tail had come into close contact with the drive shaft, leading to severe wear of the drive shaft section and eventual failure.Sources: ATSB   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot attempted to re-cycle the landing gear but without success; later he noticed that he also had indications of LIFT DUMP FAIL and ANTI SKID FAIL. He diverted to Farnborough. After touchdown the pilot attempted to deploy the lift dump system but, as expected, the lift dump spoilers failed to extend. After discussing the problem with the aircraft's maintenance organisation, the aircraft was flown to Blackbushe for further technical investigation. After landing on runway 26 (4400 feet long) the aircraft left the runway, struck a series of obstructions and was destroyed. The support bracket for the right main landing gear weight-on-wheels switch was found to have sustained a pre-impact failure which accounted for the indications reported by the pilot.Sources: AAIB Bulletin 1/2005   Location  Images: photo (c) aeroprints.com; Rantoul, KS; 30 April 2013; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

After landing uneventfully at their destination airport, the crewmembers observed that the number two right engine cowling had separated and struck the right inboard elevator.  Inspection of the airplane revealed that the engine cowling upper forward hinge required three bolts.  However, only one bolt remained attached, and there was no evidence that the other two bolts tore away during flight.  Fretting was observed in the area of the bolt holes, consistent with an oscillation over a period of time, due to the absence of two bolts.  The airliner maintenance manual required a general inspection of the area, but did not specifically mention cowling hinge bolts.  In addition, the hinges were located in an area that was not easily accessible to maintenance personnel. Probable Cause: The failure of the number two upper forward right engine cowling attachment, which resulted in substantial damage to the right inboard elevator.

Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed. The commercial-rated pilot received minor injuries, and one passenger received serious injuries, and the airplane was destroyed. The flight originated at Stuart-Witham Field, FL (SUA) the same day, about 18:45. The pilot stated that he initiated a fuel transfer due to a fuel imbalance. To affect the fuel transfer, he said he ""began crossfeed right to left."" When the airplane was about 5 to 10 miles away from Spruce Creek Airport, the pilot said he began his descent from 12,500, and also executed a left turn to begin setting up to land, when suddenly, both engines ceased operating. When he levelled the wings both engines restarted due to auto-ignition. He said the fuel gages showed 300 to 350 lb of fuel for the right tank, and 100 to 150 pounds on the left, so he decided to continue his approach to Spruce Creek Airport. As he approached Spruce Creek Airport, he again entered a left bank to prepare for a left base to runway 23, and while established in the left turn, both engines ceased operating a second time. He said he did not think he could reach the runway, and decided to make an landing on a taxiway. When the wings became level after the turn, he said both engines again restarted while in the vicinity of the beginning of the taxiway. As he was about to land, he said a car pulled out onto the taxiway, and stopped on the centerline, so he applied power to avoid the car. He said he climbed straight out, and when he made a climbing left turn, he said the engines ceased operating a third time, and the airplane descended towards a cluster of condos. With no runway or clear area in sight, the pilot said he guided the airplane to a retention pond. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The pilot's inadequate management of the airplane's fuel system, which resulted in fuel starvation, a loss of engine power, a forced landing, and damage to the airplane during the landing.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: MIA04LA071 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The co-pilot was at the controls and was flying a non-precision approach for runway 05. The pilot-in-command took the controls less than one mile from the runway threshold and saw the runway when they were over the threshold. At approximately 10:18 the wheels touched down approximately 1500 feet from the end of runway 05. The pilot-in-command realized that the remaining landing distance was insufficient. He told the co-pilot to retract the flaps and applied full power, but did not reveal his intentions. The co-pilot cut power, selected reverse pitch and applied full braking. The aircraft continued rolling through the runway end, sank into the gravel and snow, and stopped abruptly about 500 feet past the runway end. The aircraft was severely damaged. None of the occupants were injured. FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1. The aircraft was positioned over the runway threshold at an altitude that did not allow a landing at the beginning of the runway, and this, combined with a tailwind component and the wet runway surface, resulted in a runway excursion. 2. Failure to follow standard operating procedures and a lack of crew coordination contributed to confusion on landing, which prevented the crew from aborting the landing and executing a missed approach. 3. The pilot-in-command held several management positions within the company and controlled the pilot hiring and dismissal policies. This situation, combined with the level of experience of the co-pilot compared with that of the pilot-in-command, had an impact on crew cohesiveness.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A04Q0049 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: TSB   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The next flight was to Trieste (TRS); the copilot was the pilot flying on this leg. The airplane departed at 08:47. The MD-82 landed at Trieste's runway 09 after an uneventful flight. The crew were cleared to taxi to the ramp and took taxiway Bravo, which was the first taxiway to the right. With the sun in front the view of the crew was bit hampered. At the last moment the captain noticed a vehicle to his right hand side. He steered to the left to avoid it, but the truck impacted the right wing. The outer part of the wing (3,5 m/ca. 11 feet) was almost completely sheared off. The fuel tank ruptured, causing a fuel spill on the taxiway. After noticing the spill, the crew ordered an emergency evacuation of the airplane. The evacuation was initiated one minute and 20 seconds after the collision. One minute and 24 seconds later, the fire brigade had reached the scene. It appeared that construction works were in progress near taxiway Bravo. A Notam was not issued about this and the tower controller had not informed the crew either. CAUSES (translated from Italian): The analysis of the technical, operational and organizational context in which the event took place (impact of the end of the right wing of the aircraft, during taxiing, against the rear body of a truck that was parked for work within the protection area of the taxiway that leads from the BRAVO connection to the parking area) has allowed to determine the following causes, which are attributable to human and environmental factors. - Failure to close the BRAVO taxiway with the issue of the relative NOTAM of the works in progress. - Failure of the Torre control to provide the pilots with essential information on the condition of the airport, as provided for by ICAO in ICAO Doc. 4444 PANS-ATM. - Vertical and horizontal ground signs do not correspond to those specified in ICAO Annex 14. - Failure to comply with the ENAC circular (APT-11), applicable for the type of work in progress at the airport. - Insufficient surveillance of the airport area affected by the works by ENAC and the airport management company Aeroporto FVG. - Lack of an airport Safety Management System . - Inadequate surveillance of the external space during taxiing by the flight crew, resulting in incorrect assessment of the position of the aircraft with respect to the obstacle.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ANSV Report number: A/9/05 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: ANSV   Location  Images: photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Roma-Fiumicino Airport (FCO); 16 June 2001 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The operating hours of the only airport nearby, Melo, are from 07:00 hrs to 19:00 hrs, so it was closed. Montevideo ACC contacted the airport guard who switched on the runway lights and reported the emergency to fire fighters and police located in the city. The aircraft found the runway lights and landed on runway 07. Touchdown took place 340 m from the threshold. The F-27 stopped 640 m after touchdown. The crew evacuated through the cockpit windows, due to the intense heat and smoke in the cargo area. Ten minutes after landing, the fire fighters arrived and succeeded in extinguishing the fire. The airplane suffered considerable damage in the cargo compartments E and F. PROBABLE CAUSE (translated from Spanish): Numerous oil samples, plant tissues, and several animals that were transported, would have reacted on contact with an exothermic chemical reaction and associated combustion. The event originated with the spilling of liquid from containers not suitable for differential pressure, with little excess capacity for expansion and filled with indiscriminate materials. Low stringency in filling forms for description of product delivered for shipment in company offices and little control or careless handling of the load would have contributed to the occurrence of the accident.Sources: ICAO Adrep  NTSB  Images: photo (c) Jose Maria Techera; Melo Airport (MLZ/SUMO); 02 August 2015 photo (c) Elliot Greenman, via Werner Fischdick; Pittsburgh International Airport, PA (PIT/KPIT) [N]; May 1990 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The three pilots and five mechanics escaped unhurt. The airplane was attached to the Escadron de Transport Outre-Mer 58 (ETOM 00.058) and was being prepared for a test flight. Shortly after start-up, just as the airplane has commenced taxiing towards the runway, a fire erupted. The airplane was stopped immediately. Three minutes later the fire services arrived and extinguished the fire. The airplane sustained serious damage to the left wing, left hand fuselage and tail section. CAUSES:  The accident was caused by electrical arcing at the power cable to a submersible fuel pump. This arcing occured above the kerosene liquid inside the tank full of fuel vapors. The cable type used was chosen at the time of the design of the aircraft. Atmospheric conditions on the apron of Fort de France have raised the temperature of the reservoir beyond the flash point kerosene. The vapors contained in this tank were explosive, and the arc was enough to initiate the blast. As such, atmospheric conditions are a certain cause of environmental origin of the accident. The appearance of the arc is, in turn, has only technical causes: - The quality of cable used and age are in fact responsible for the creation of the electric arc. - The formation of the insulating sheath of this type of cable is not likely to ensure an absolute seal. This quality is also not claimed by its manufacturer. Indeed, the analyzes carried out show a porosity of electrical cable, even nine, therefore that it is soaked in kerosene. The presence of kerosene increases the phenomenon of porosity of old cables. Degradation characteristics of dielectric strength of the cable insulation explains the appearance of the arc. The accident occurred while the cable was over 19 years old. The fuel pumps wiring has never been a problem. But there has not been a cable that had reached the age of 19 years. The aging of the cable could still degrade the seal. Finally, maintaining this type of cable on the first C160 series until this accident was part of a complex process in which traceability has not been formally established. Doubts indeed appeared in 1969 on the quality of these cables, doubts that can be considered today as precursors. Measures had been adopted precisely to overcome these deficiencies.  In this regard, the replacement of the fuel pump wiring of the second series C 160 of these cables with a newer type and considered more efficient is particularly significant. Its extension to the first series aircraft might have seemed relevant, and would probably have prevented the accident. The reasons which led to the maintenance of such cables on the C 160 series first held in both the human factor (underestimation of risk, lack of global view on the issue) and organizational factors, which can be seen as a lack of traceability of technical and logistic actions, a lack of consistency of the measures adopted, and probable deficiencies in the information flow.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEAD Report number: BEAD-A-2004-012-A Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: Scramble 321   Location  Images: photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Mildenhall RAF Station (MHZ); August 1990 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Following the startup of the engines, an explosion occurred in the left wing area aft of the number 1 engine firewall and number 1 auxiliary fuel tank.  The airplane was parked next to the mine's fuel storage tank, and the pilot added power on the remaining engines to move away from the storage tank.  Within seconds of beginning to move, the number 1 engine fell off the burning wing, followed by separation and aft folding of the outboard end of the left wing.  The outboard end of the wing, however, was still attached via control cables.  The pilot taxied the airplane about 200 feet, dragging the partially burning left wing segment to a pond of water and shut down the remaining engines. The crew evacuated with no injuries.  Water was applied to the airplane until the fire was extinguished, about 3 1/2 hours later.  NTSB and FAA personnel did not travel to the scene, and the airplane was not recovered from the mining strip.  The airplane's left wing powerplant and fuel system consists of the number 1 and 2 engines.  Each engine is separated from the wing by a firewall.  Within the wing, from outboard to inboard, the fuel tank system consists of the number 1 fuel tank, the left wing auxiliary fuel tank, and the number 2 fuel tank.  Each wet-wing type fuel tank contains a submerged electrical boost pump, sump drain valves and fuel quantity transmitters.  The fuel system has selector valves, crossfeed valves, and shut-off valves for each tank.  An FAA inspector examined portions of the airplane that the operator supplied.  The inspector examined a portion of the upper wing surface that had been blown away from the airplane during the initial explosion.  He noted that the inside of the upper wing surface, normally positioned over the auxiliary tank, was not charred or sooted.  A separated portion of the lower wing surface, near the auxiliary boost pump, was sooted and charred.  The aft side of the number 1 engine firewall was not charred.  A portion of the number 1 engine nacelle was oily, but not sooted or charred.  The operator located the auxiliary in-tank boost pump and sent it to the FAA.  The boost pump impeller, encased in a small wire cage, was not melted and could be turned by hand.  The body of the pump was sooted but not thermally damaged.

The captain was the nonflying pilot for the flight, and the first officer was the flying pilot. The takeoff, climb, and en route portions of the flight were uneventful. At 14:37, as the flight approached the San Juan traffic area, the ATIS reported that winds were 060 degrees at 17 knots and gusting at 23 knots. Shortly thereafter, the captain briefed a Vref (the minimum approach airspeed in the landing configuration before the airplane reaches the runway threshold) of 95 knots and told the first officer to ""stand by for winds."" At 14:43 SJU Terminal Radar Approach Control cautioned the pilots of possible wake turbulence from a preceding Boeing. The captain told the first officer to slow down to about 140 kts. At 14:46, the local controller cleared the airplane to land on runway 08. The first officer turned the airplane left toward runway 08 and transitioned to the visual approach slope indicator. At 14:49, the captain stated, ""you better keep that nose down or get some power up because you're gonna balloon."" The airplane descended below the glideslope, causing a GPWS ""glideslope"" alert. The airplane was about 45 feet above ground level and traveling at 110 knots indicated airspeed when it crossed the runway 08 threshold. After the airplane crossed the runway threshold, the captain stated, ""power in a little bit, don't pull the nose up, don't pull the nose up."" At 14:49:39, the captain stated, ""you're ballooning,"" and the first officer replied, ""all right.""  The airplane touched down for the first time about 14:49:41 and about 1,600 feet beyond the runway 08 threshold with vertical and lateral loads of about 1.3 Gs and -0.10 G, respectively. Upon touchdown the captain stated, ""get the power,"" and, 1 second later, ""my aircraft."" The first officer responded, ""your airplane."" The airplane had skipped to an altitude of about 4 feet and touched down again two seconds later about 2,200 feet beyond the runway 08 threshold. The airplane then pitched up to an angle of 9Â° while climbing to an altitude of 37 feet and the engine torque increased from 10 to 43 percent. About 14:49:49, the pitch angle decreased to -3Â°, and the engine torque started to decrease to 20 percent with the pitch angle decreasing to -10Â°. The airplane touched down a third time about 14:49:51 at a bank angle of 7Â° left wing down and about 3,300 feet beyond the runway 08 threshold and with vertical and lateral loads of about 5 Gs and 0.85 G. The ATR pitched up again to 24 feet and landed a fourth time about 14:49:56 (about 15 seconds after the initial touchdown) and about 4,000 feet beyond the runway 08 threshold. This time the airplane pitched down to -7Â° and that it was banked 29Â° left wing down. The airplane came to a complete stop on a grassy area about 217 feet left of the runway centerline and about 4,317 feet beyond the runway threshold. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the captainÂs failure to execute proper techniques to recover from the bounced landings and his subsequent failure to execute a go-around.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NTSB/AAR-05-02 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  14 June 1997 N438AT Simmons Airlines 0 Dallas, TX min Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; San Juan-Luis Munoz Marin International Airport (SJU); May 2004; (publicdomain) photo (c) Pedro de la Cruz via Werner Fischdick; Puerto Plata-La Union Airport (POP); August 2002 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Each time 9018 kgs of fuel was uplifted in El Obeid while the average fuel consumption for a round trip was 10000 kgs. On the second round trip on May 11, on the leg back to El Obeid, 4201 kgs of fuel remained. The flight departed at 11:40 UTC and climbed to the cruising altitude of FL240. En route all four engines flamed out as a result of a lack of fuel. The propellers were feathered and the aircraft was prepared for a forced landing. The aircraft hit the ground with its nose first and bounced for 15 meters until it collided with trees. Due to high impact force and high rate of descent the wings were twisted. The cockpit section was compressed within the central cargo compartment and a small fire erupted, likely due to electrical shortage within the electrical equipment. There were no survivors. The crew was composed of an Armenian captain and ground engineer, a Sudanese first officer, a Sudanese navigator, a Sudanese radio operator, an Iraqi navigator and an Iraqi flight engineer. The investigation showed that the Sudanese navigator license was expired since July 2001. The Iraqi crew members did not have any valid licenses and their experience on the An-12 dated back from 1994. The aircraft's Certificate of Release to Service and Certificate of Maintenance Review both expired on April 30, 2004. Cause of Accident a) Fuel starvation due to Company fuel planning policy. b) The exhaustion of the Captain as he was handling all flights during the three days preceding the accident flight in addition to the weather on day of accident. c) Some of the crew members had limited experience on the type and three of them even did not fly on AN-12 for a long time which might aggravate the situation before the crash.Sources: akhbaralyoumsd.com  Aviation Letter 451  ICAO Adrep   Location  Images: photo (c) AviaNet Images (www.avianet.de), via Werner Fischdick; Sharjah Airport (SHJ); December 2003 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

During the descent at 1105Z and approximately 1nm from joining overhead the aerodrome for landing on Runway 18 at Phinda Aerodrome, the pilot observed a bird just in front and slightly above the aircraft. He then shouted 'bird'? but at that moment the bird impacted and shattered the co-pilot's windshield. The pilot-in-command immediately took control of the aircraft in order to assess the damage sustained by the bird strike and also the controllability of the aircraft as the co-pilot was dazed and bleeding from his head. The pilot-in-command immediately called Mayday and turned onto left downwind with the aircraft yawing to the right with a loss of airspeed. At that stage, he experienced difficulty in turning the aircraft to the left and required additional power in order to maintain airspeed and rudder input to maintain runway heading. The aircraft landed safely with only a slight bounce. The co-pilot's windshield was found completely shattered, the right-hand wing leading edge was dented at the wing root, headliner and cabin panels broken and seats and interior soiled. The co- pilot sustained facial cuts and bruises and 2 passengers sustained facial cuts. The last MPI was certified on 12 February 2004 at a total of 2950.4 hours. The aircraft had flown an addition of 70.9 hours since the MPI was certified. The pilot was in possession of a valid Commercial pilot's license no. 437925, issued by the Licence Authority of Australia and South African validation, J6/15/1/6431 at the time of the accident. The Operator was in possession of a valid Air Operating Certificate No CAA N142D that was issued on 18 December 2003 and valid until 17 December 2004.

According to the captain, the right wing was bent up 10 to 20 degrees 3 to 4 feet inboard of the wingtip.  When the accident occurred, the airplane was turning left from a magnetic heading of approximately 210 degrees to a heading of approximately 120 degrees.  The captain estimated the wind was from 110 degrees (magnetic) at 35 knots gusting 40 knots.  The Automated Weather Observing Station (AWOS) at the airport reported winds from 150 degrees (true) at 39 knots gusting 48 knots. Probable Cause: The captain's improper evaluation of the weather conditions and improper decision to taxi the airplane in high gusting wind conditions which resulted in the airplane's right wing striking the ground.

The pilot stated that he was high and fast during the descent into Las Vegas but that the approach was ""stable"" by 500 feet. He stated that he maintained his Vref speed of 112 knots from there until touchdown.  The passenger stated that he felt that the approach was ""fast"" and that the pilot was ""behind the power curve"" because of high minimum enroute altitudes in the area and that they had to ""hustle down"" during the descent. The passenger indicated that the flight crossed the runway threshold ""maybe a bit more"" that 10 knots above Vref and touched down about 10 knots above Vref. He said it was not a stabilized approach. Landing distance calculations and other evidence suggest that the lift dump panels did not extend after landing; however, the investigation did not determine the reason(s) for the lack of lift dump. No evidence was found of any failures affecting the lift dump or braking systems. Evidence and interview statements reveal that the pilot flew an unstabilized approach to the runway and landed well above target speed. The high landing speed was result of the pilot's excessive airspeed on the approach and a tailwind component of about 8 knots. Although the pilot landed the airplane within the touchdown area, the airplane's speed upon touchdown was about 17 knots above the prescribed speed. After exiting the end of runway 7, the airplane continued and impacted a perimeter fence and came to rest approximately 735 feet beyond the end of runway. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The flight's unstabilized approach and excessive speed.

It was carrying one pilot and nine passengers. The takeoff, climb out and the initial phase of the flight were normal. About 20 minutes into the flight at FL125 (12500 feet amsl) when the pilot had already made a power reduction and was in the process of trimming the aircraft for level flight, a loud bang was heard that was accompanied by a loss of engine power. The pilot immediately switched on the ignition to no avail. He set the power lever to IDLE, at the same time checking the Ng, which read 0%. The indications from other instruments and the annunciator panel showed that the engine was not running. Efforts to restart the engine failed and the pilot took advantage of the high altitude to circle around in order to find a convenient field for executing a forced landing. The pilot subsequently located a Masai steppe overlooking Loiborsoit village in Simanjiro. After briefing the passengers about the imminent forced landing the pilot made a touch down on a grass field. After rolling for about 400 meters 5H-AXL ran into a terraced field from which maize had been harvested. Tire marks on the ground indicated that it was here that the nose landing gear struck raised lip of earth and sheared from its fuselage attachment point. It subsequently penetrated into the forward baggage pod compartment. The aircraft came to rest some 480 meters beyond the point of initial touch down. The pilot opened the cockpit door and all passengers disembarked safely. There was no fire and there were no injuries.  The aircraft sustained damage to its nose landing gear which separated and the propeller, whose two blades were bent. One of the tubular members of the engine bearer frame was bent and the baggage pod was damaged when it scraped the ground. CAUSE(S): The accident was caused by the aircraft stalling and crashing whilst trying to avoid a truck on the road. The attempt to land on the road was necessitated by the loss of power arising from the engine CT blade(s) failure in flight. The cause of the CT blade(s) failure could not be determined due to severe overheating and impact damage to the blade airfoils. The failure of the pilot to see the landing sight clearly through the wind screen due to the splash of engine oil on the wind screen was a major contributory factor.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIB Tanzania Report number: ACC/14/04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: 2004 Air Accidents / Incidents (Tanzania CAA, AIB)  NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) Eric Groot; Zanzibar-Kisauni Airport (ZNZ/HTZA); 11 August 2011 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

At an height below 100 feet during the final approach, the aircraft was caught by windshear. The flight crew initiated a missed approach procedure during which the tail of the aircraft struck the runway. The aircraft circled and landed safely at 10:31 hours. PROBABLE CAUSE (translated from Italian): A probable and sudden variability in wind direction and intensity (wind shear phenomenon), which occurred below 100 feet, resulteded in a reduction in aircraft speed, which was only partially compensated by the crew. This was followed by a missed approach procedure, during which the rear part of the aircraft impacted the runway, causing damage to the structure of the fuselage. A contributing factor was that the approach was made below the intended path and a late execution of the missed approach manoeuvre.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ANSV Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  22 January 2019 VH-NJZ National Jet Express 0 Sydney-Kingsford Smith International Airport, NSW (SYD/YSSY) non Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

While taxiing westbound to the gate, airport operations requested him to hold on the taxiway between A4 and A5, to give a Delta Air Lines pushback crew some room to move another airplane. After stopping, he set the brakes, and made a passenger announcement. Approximately 3 minutes later, the airplane was struck from the left rear by a snowplow. The force of the impact pushed the left main landing gear forward approximately 10 feet, turning the airplane to the right as it rotated about its right main landing gear. The captain stated that he shut down the engines, requested an assessment from the flight attendants, and told the first officer to call for fire equipment. He then surveyed the damage from the cockpit window and aft galley service door window. By that time, the snowplow had backed off to the east approximately 50 yards. The captain stated that the airport visibility was reported at 2 miles. However, he could see the Western State ""W"" on a hill, approximately 2.5 miles south of the airport. After an assessment of the damage and confirmation from the fire crew that it was safe, the airplane was towed to the ramp and the passengers were deplaned with the airstairs. The snow plow operator stated visibility was poor.  He said he was unsure of where the airplane was.  As he was plowing the taxiway ""out of nowhere was the 737.""  The driver applied brakes, but it was too late.  Following the accident, the airport made several changes to its operating procedures with respect to snowplow operations and radio communications with airport vehicles.  Probable Cause: the snowplow driver's failure to see the airplane during plowing operations.

Night instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. There were no injuries. The cross-country flight originated at Kansas City (MKC), Missouri, approximately 17:30. According to a written statement submitted by the captain, they had flown the GPS approach to runway 35. When they did not see the runway or runway environment they initiated a missed approach. During the missed approach procedure, they were able to see the first 4 to 5 thousand feet on the approach end of runway 17.

Despite this, he continued to taxi, but because the lever remained stiff, he decided to contact the company operations and the Control Tower to return to the platform. On returning, at the turn between taxiways echo and alpha, the captain lost the effectiveness of the brakes and steering, causing the aircraft to crash into the hangar of the Mapiex company, damaging the aircraft and the wall of the hangar. CONCLUSIONS: The cause of the accident was due to a failure in the hydraulic system's pump pressure, which made it impossible for the crew to control the aircraft's braking and steering.

Weather at Manchester however was foggy and the pilot was unable to land there. The pilot then requested to proceed to his alternate destination, Burlington. During the flight to Burlington, the pilot was contacted by company dispatch and it was agreed that Bennington would be a better destination because it was 45 miles closer than Burlington. As the flight progressed towards Bennington, the pilot contacted ATC and requested to change his destination to Keene. Weather at Keene included winds from 350 degrees at 3 knots; 1 statute mile of visibility; an overcast cloud layer at 100 feet agl. The Bandeirante flew an ILS approach to runway 02. When the airplane broke out of the clouds, it was not stable. Approaching the runway, at full flaps and exceeding the 25 percent maximum for a go-around, the pilot added full power to the left engine. The high power setting, slow airspeed, and full flaps combination resulted in a minimum control speed (Vmc) roll. No determination could be made as to why the right engine was inoperative, and there were no mechanical or fuel-related anomalies found that would have precluded normal operation. The airplane came to rest inverted on runway 02, about 90 feet from the approach end. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The pilot's improper decision to attempt a single-engine missed approach with the airplane in a slow airspeed, full flap configuration, which resulted in a minimum control speed (Vmc) roll. Contributing factors included an inoperative engine for undetermined reasons, the pilot's in-flight decision to divert to an airport with low ceilings and visibility while better conditions existed elsewhere, the pilot's failure to advise or seek assistance from air traffic control or his company, and the low cloud ceilings, fog, and night lighting conditions.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NYC05FA042 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, TX (DFW); May 1989 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft had earlier departed the aerodrome on a charter flight with one pilot and seven passengers on board. The pilot had elected to return to the airport after detecting a problem during the retraction of the aircraft's landing gear. He attempted to manually extend the landing gear, but was unable to confirm that the landing gear had locked in position for the subsequent precautionary landing. The main landing gear collapsed as the aircraft touched down. Examination of the aircraft landing gear by the aircraft operator revealed an incorrectly installed thrust bearing in the hydraulic actuator for the left main landing gear. The result was that the axial loads normally carried by the thrust bearing were transferred to the actuator's pinion gears which fractured under abnormal operational loads. That damage seized the actuator and prevented the manual extension of the aircraft's landing gear by the pilot.Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  9 April 2007 VH-SGT Network Aviation Australia 0 Perth Airport, WA (PER) sub Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Estimated flying time was 1 hour and 29 minutes. The copilot was Pilot Flying. Weather at the destination, Oviedo-Asturias Airport, was poor with rain, fog and a cloud base of 300 ft. The flight crew decided to hold at FL100 over the Asturias VOR. The captain assumed the role of Pilot Flying at this time. Once the weather improved, approaches to runway 29 resumed. Two aircraft landed before flight JK5811 without reporting any problems. Since the cloud base was between 200 and 400 ft, the flight was force to make an ILS approach to runway 29, which meant a landing with a tail wind as winds were reported from 050Â° at 10 kt with gusts to 18 kt. The tail wind component was calculated to be 5-9,5 knots and the aircraft's tail wind limit was 10 knots. When the aircraft was at 270 ft, the crew reported runway in sight. Nine seconds later and twelve seconds before touchdown, the captain disconnected the autopilot. The autothrottle system remained active. Descent rate fluctuated, at times reaching 1000 ft/min. The pilot stated that at about 50 ft he observed an uncommanded descent of the aircraft and tried to compensate by increasing the engine thrust. On touchdown the vertical acceleration reached 4.11g. The aircraft bounced and touched down again, with one of the wheels hitting a runway edge light on the right hand side. Spoilers then extended and the thrust reversers were activated by the crew. The aircraft decellerated normally and taxied to the platform. Substantial damage to the airframe was noted. The captain sustained serious spinal injuries. He was briefly incapacitated after the first touchdown, forcing the copilot to take control during the bounce. Causes (translated from Spanish): It is considered that the probable cause of the accident was a significant variation in the intensity and wind direction at the time of landing prompting a 4.11g vertical acceleration, however, with the weather information available, it could not be determined if there were objective conditions for the possibility of windshear during landing. A contributing factor was the maneuver made by the aircraft, which is not consistent with a standard maneuver, since it there were variations in pitch, from 84 ft radio altimeter and a decrease of the plane relative to the ILS glide slope combined with the performance of autothrotle at idle and possible variations of wind in the final phase of landing which would place the aircraft on a path other than the nominal.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIAIAC Report number: A-013/2005 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 years and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The en route part of the flight was uneventful. The flight crew established radio contact with DÃ¼sseldorf Radar at 05:43. The crew were told that runway 23L was in use.  Two minutes later the radar controller contacted flight 8995: ""I just talked to the tower and ah for the time being braking action on all parts of the runway is supposed to be good. They are measuring again right now because it started to snow again and I'll keep you advised."" The flight was then cleared to descend to FL80. The flight crew decided to set the autobrakes for landing on Medium, to account for the snow. At 05:50 the radar controller again contacted the flight about the current weather circumstances: ""...latest update on the weather situation ahm the friction tester has reported braking action to be good for the moment however as its continuing to snow they are ah afraid that it might worsen, so they are going to do another friction test right before you land."" In the following minutes the flight was given descent instructions and vectors for an approach to runway 23L. At 05:54 the controller radioed: ""weather update we now have a surface wind of three four zero degrees eleven knots, that's slight tail wind component by two knots. Visibility is down to one thousand five hundred meters, still in snow showers and ah cloud base is now five hundred feet only."" The flight was subsequently cleared for the approach. At 05:57 the radar controller instructed the crew to contact DÃ¼sseldorf Tower. The Tower controller stated: ""Good morning,... we are just waiting for the braking action values from the friction tester stand by a second. The surface wind is actually three three zero degrees one two knots."" Two minutes later the controller radioed: ""... the braking action was measured to be medium at all parts. And ah the visibility dropped right now due to the heavy snow showers at the field ah. The RVR value at the touch down zone is presently nine hundred meters, at the mid-point one thousand one hundred meters and ah stop end one thousand one hundred meters."" At that moment the flight was 3,5 nautical miles out. The flight was subsequently cleared to land. The airplane touched down about 1700 ft (518 m) past the runway threshold. Ground spoilers and thrust reversers deployed and the autobrakes activated. Still the airplane did not decelerate as expected and the pilot applied manual braking. The airplane failed to stop and overran the runway end. It collided with ILS aerials, which caused a fire in engines no. 2 and no. 3. The aircraft was withdrawn from use at DÃ¼sseldorf until being scrapped there in April 2006. Causes: The accident is attributable to the fact that the braking values transmitted to the crew did not meet the conditions that had arisen as a result of heavy snowfall since the last measurement on the runway. Contributing factors: - Fast changing weather - The lack of an in all weather conditions reliable measurement method for the determination of braking coefficient.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BFU Report number: BFU AX001-05 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 8 years and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) Felix Goetting; DÃ¼sseldorf Airport (DUS); 24 January 2005 photo (c) Felix Goetting; DÃ¼sseldorf Airport (DUS); 24 January 2005 photo (c) Felix Goetting; DÃ¼sseldorf Airport (DUS); 24 January 2005 photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Miami International Airport, FL (MIA); February 2000 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Night instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The flight was en route to MCI to pick up passengers and continue on as an on-demand charter but diverted to the Kansas City-Charles B. Wheeler Downtown Airport (MKC) following the closure of MCI. MCI was closed due to a McDonnell Douglas MD83 sliding off a taxiway during an after landing taxi on contaminated runway/taxiway conditions. MKC held a limited airport certificate that did not have a snow removal plan and was served by runway 19 (7,002 feet by 150 feet, grooved asphalt). Following a precision approach and landing on runway 19 at MKC, the Learjet 35A slid off the departure end of the runway and impacted airport property and terrain. The Learjet 35A was operated with inoperative thrust reversers as per the airplane's minimum equipment list at the time of the accident. About 1:05 hours before the accident, runway 19 Tapley values were recorded as 21-22-22 with 1/2 inch of wet snow. About 17 minutes before the accident, MKC began snow removal operations. About 7 minutes before the accident, the MKC air traffic control tower (TWR) instructed the snow removal vehicles to clear the runway for inbound traffic. TWR was advised by airport personnel that runway 19 was plowed and surface conditions were 1/4 inch of snow of snow; friction values were not taken or reported. While inbound, the Learjet 35A requested any braking action reports from TWR. The first airplane to land was a Cessna 210 Centurion, and the pilot reported braking action to the TWR as ""moderate"", which was then transmitted by TWR as ""fair"" from a Centurion in response to the Learjet 35A's query. The Cessna 210 Centurion pilot did not use brakes during landing and did not indicate this to TWR during his braking action report. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The contaminated runway conditions during landing. Contributing factors were the operation of the airplane without thrust reversers, flight to the planned alternate airport not performed by the flightcrew, and the insufficient runway information.

There were no injuries among the 22 passengers and three crew members. Danish Air Transport flight DTR54 was on a scheduled flight from Bergen to FlorÃ¸ (FRO). During takeoff the pilots experienced considerable control problems related to the elevator function. They declared an emergency situation and returned for landing. The landing was accomplished without further incident 7 minutes after takeoff. After landing it was found that the control problems were caused by the right elevator hanging below the horizontal stabiliser, attached only by the inboard of the three hinges that normally connect the elevator to the stabiliser. A bolt was missing from both the centre and outer hinges. Both of the bolts and one of the nuts that normally should connect the hinge assemblies together were found. One of the bolts was found on the runway, the other inside the elevator. Investigation indicates that the bolt belonging to the outer hinge assembly fell out during the takeoff in question, while the bolt in the centre hinge assembly had fallen out at an earlier point in time, without being discovered. The report concludes that the self-locking nuts cannot have been tightened with the required torque when the elevator was fitted. This error was most probably introduced after the aircraft was repainted in 1999. Significant investigation results: The control problems experienced by the crew during take-off and the rest of the flight began when the outboard of the three hinge bolts that attach the right elevator to the stabiliser loosened and fell out. As the centre bolt had fallen out at an earlier point in time without being discovered, the elevator was hanging in place only attached by the inboard hinge. The self-locking nuts that should hold the centre and outboard hinge bolts in place cannot have been tightened with the required torque.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIBN Report number: 8/2006 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) AIBN; Bergen-Flesland Airport (BGO); 31 January 2005; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft was owned by Nord-Flyg and operated under the name NTD Air Cargo. After landing, the pilot taxied to apron number four in the southeastern corner of the aerodrome and unloaded the cargo from Sweden. After having done that he left the airport and went to a suite the company reserves for the crew to rest before the return leg to Sweden, which was planned for the following afternoon. As per standard policy, the company operates the aircraft with a two person crew. On the day in question the co-pilot had taken ill and the pilot had flown alone. The return leg to Sweden was also planned as a one-person crew flight. The following morning the aircraft was refuelled with 420 l of Jet A-1, in accordance with the pilotÂs instructions. All in all ca. 725 kg of fuel was reserved for the return leg. It had been snowing at the airport until 11:20 and the temperature was hovering at around zero degrees Celsius. After having arrived at the airport at 16:30, the pilot began to brush the accumulated snow and frozen snow melt off the upper surfaces of the aircraft. As per his account, there was a great deal of snow and ice on the aircraft. He did not, however, manage to brush all of the impurities off of the surfaces of the aircraft. The cargo going to Sweden did not arrive in time for him to fly it to Skavsta, his primary destination. Therefore, he phoned in a change to the flight plan choosing Ãrebro instead as his destination.  At 18:52:45 the pilot acknowledged on Helsinki Control Tower (TWR) that he was taxiing to takeoff position runway 22L at intersection Y. At 16:54:40 TWR gave him takeoff clearance from that intersection and gave him the wind direction. The pilot later said that he executed a normal takeoff, using 10 degrees of flaps. The aircraft lifted off at the normal speed of 80-90 kts. All went well until he reached the height of 800-1000 ft (250-300 m) and retracted the trailing edge flaps. Immediately after flap retraction, the pilot lost control of the aircraft, which began turning to the right. The pilot attempted to fly the aircraft to the end section of runway 22R to make an emergency landing but the aircraft crashed into the terrain between the runways. DIRECT CAUSAL FACTORS: ""The chain of events can be regarded as having begun when the aeroplane stood overnight on the tarmac, exposed to the weather. Snowfall accumulated on the upper surfaces of the fuselage, wings and stabilizers during the night forming a thick coat of ice and snow as it partly melted during the day and refroze when the ambient temperature dropped towards the evening.  The pilot noticed the impurities when he performed a walkaround check. However, he did not order a de-icing. Instead, he tried to remove the ice with a brush. It is only possible to remove dry and loose snow by brushing. In this case the frozen water that had trickled down remained stuck to surfaces. The pilot executed a takeoff with an aircraft whose aerodynamic properties were fundamentally degraded due to impurities. During the initial climb, immediately after flap retraction, airflow separated from the surface of the wing and the pilot did not manage to regain control of the aircraft. The pilot did not recognize the stall for what is was and did not act in the required manner to recover or, then again, it could be that he had not received sufficient training for these kinds of situations."" cONTRIBUTING CAUSAL FACTORS: ""Several factors are considered to have affected the pilotÂs actions. He was either ignorant or negligent as to the effect of impurities on the aeroplaneÂs aerodynamic properties. Furthermore, the pressure of keeping to the schedule during the early preflight briefing activities may have affected his decision, even though a change in the flight plan eliminated the actual rush. It is the impression of the investigation commission that these factors were the principal ones that contributed to the omission of proper deicing. A probable contributing factor, albeit one difficult to verify, could have been the financial aspect. The company may have considered buying de-icing services from an external service provider as an additional expense. Investigations showed that the operator in question had ordered aeroplane de-icing at HelsinkiÂVantaa airport only once during the previous and ongoing winter season. The company regularly flew to this airport. Processes were in place for pre-flight briefing as well as for freight forwarding. However, the flight schedules with reference to the opening times of the companyÂs primary destination airport did not allow for long delays in ground operations. This may have partly put pressure on the pilot to complete the other pre-flight activities as soon as possible. As for the flap setting, the pilotÂs takeoff technique was not proper for the existing circumstances. Moreover, when the aeroplane stalled, the pilot did not execute any effective corrective action to regain control of the aircraft. These would have been, among other things: having reset the flaps to the position prior to the stall as well as having taken advantage of the engine power reserve. As per his account, the pilot did not utilize all available engine power. Instead, he stuck to the maximum value prescribed for normal operations as specified in the aircraft operations manual.

When takeoff speed was reached the pilot tried to lift the plane off the runway but, according to his statement the control wheel was stuck. He then aborted the takeoff, but the plane skidded off the runway. It went through the perimeter fence, crossed a highway and crashed into a building. About 15 people were injured, one critically, but nobody was killed, officials said. The injured included two people in cars along the highway. Preliminary investigation results indicate that the airplane's center of gravity (CG) was well forward of the allowable limit.  On December 16, 2003 another Challenger jet aborted takeoff at Teterboro when the flightcrew was unable to rotate the airplane. The aircraft overran the runway. In this case, the NTSB determined that the plane was above the maximum gross takeoff weight, and outside the forward center-of-gravity envelope. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of the accident was the flight crewÂs failure to ensure the airplane was loaded within weight and balance limits and their attempt to take off with the center of gravity well forward of the forward takeoff limit, which prevented the airplane from rotating at the intended rotation speed. Contributing to the accident were: 1) PJMÂs conduct of charter flights (using PJM pilots and airplanes) without proper FAA certification and its failure to ensure that all for-hire flights were conducted in accordance with 14  CFR Part 135 requirements; 2) Darby AviationÂs failure to maintain operational control over 14 CFR Part 135 flights being conducted under its certificate by PJM, which resulted in an environment conducive to the development of systemic patterns of flight crew performance deficiencies like those observed in this accident; 3) the failure of the Birmingham, Alabama, FAA Flight Standards District Office to provide adequate surveillance and oversight of operations conducted under DarbyÂs Part 135 certificate; and 4) the FAAÂs tacit approval of arrangements such as that between Darby and PJM.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NTSB/AAR-06/04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   AP  NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Teterboro Airport, NJ (TEB); February 2005; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Teterboro Airport, NJ (TEB); February 2005; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Teterboro Airport, NJ (TEB); February 2005; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All 105 on board were killed. The Boeing 737-242 aircraft, with Kyrgyz Republic registration EX-037, departed from Herat at 10:02 UTC. The estimated time of arrival (ETA) at Kabul International Airport was 10:55 UTC. The aircraft was cruising at flight level 270 when it contacted Bagram Radar Approach Control (""Bagram"") for descent and landing. The flight was normal until it failed to level at flight level 130 during the VOR/DME approach. At 10:43 UTC, Bagram cleared the flight to descend at its discretion and to expect the VOR approach to runway 29. The prevailing weather was also passed on to the aircraft. Visibility was reported 2 kilometers with snow, ceiling 2200 feet broken. wind calm and altimeter setting QNH 1016. When the aircraft was 35 miles west of the Kabul VOR, radar contact was established with Bagram. The aircraft was advised by Bagram to cross the VOR at or above flight level 130 and cleared it for the VOR/DME approach to runway 29 at Kabul Airport. At 10:48 UTC the aircraft reported flight level 130. Bagram again cleared the aircraft for the VOR approach to runway 29 and advised the aircraft to report procedure turn inbound. The crew replied that they would report proceeding inbound for the VOR approach to runway 29. This was the last transmission from the aircraft. Search for the aircraft was delayed and hampered due to a severe snowstorm in the region. The aircraft was located approximately three days later by an International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) helicopter The Flight Data Recorder (FDR) was recovered, but the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) could not be found. No data was found recorded on the FDR. Probable Cause: ""The accident occurred probably due to the premature descent by the Aircraft below its minimum assigned altitude of 13,000 feet during approach in weather conditions below VFR requirements.

The airplane was about 7 minutes from landing, and the flight attendant was completing his before landing checklist when turbulence was encountered.  After regaining consciousness a few seconds later, he was able to get to an empty passenger seat.  A deadheading flight attendant assumed the incapacitated flight attendant's duties.  Review and analysis of available weather data and forecast products showed that airman's meteorological information (AIRMET) Update 6 was issued by the National Weather Service (NWS) and in effect for the flight for occasional moderate turbulence below 12,000 feet.  A review of the meteorological data showed that the airplane was operating in conditions that would have supported at least moderate turbulence below 10,000 feet msl.  The weather packet included in the flight release provided to the flight crew by the airline's dispatch prior to the flight contained information for AIRMET Update 3; however, AIRMET Update 6 (valid for the accident flight) was not listed.  Information contained on the release indicated to the crew that no moderate or greater turbulence was present along the route of flight.  At the time of the accident, the airline's contract weather provider evaluated current meteorological data and staff meteorologists used their judgment of the weather to issue a SIGMEC (significant meteorological conditions, a company issued advisory) based on the current weather conditions.  NWS-issued SIGMET Yankee was canceled at 1630 because the current pilot reports (PIREPS) indicated that previously forecasted turbulent conditions had diminished.  Although an AIRMET was in effect at the time of the accident for moderate or greater turbulence, there were no other supporting indicators to the airline staff meteorologist that moderate or greater turbulence was present along the route of flight.  Due to the cancellation of the SIGMET and the lack of additional supporting information for moderate or greater turbulence, the meteorologist did not issue a SIGMEC.  Therefore, the turbulence information was not on the flight release provided to the flight crew.

Approximately nine minutes before the landing, the co-pilot activated the aircraft radio control of aerodrome lighting (ARCAL) and contacted the approach UNICOM at Bromont. The Bromont Airport dispatcher informed the crew that only the PAPI was operational. A NOTAM had been issued on 17 February 2005, indicating that the runway edge lights would be out of order until 22:00 UTC, 22 February 2005. The PAPI and the approach lights lit up when the co-pilot activated the ARCAL, because their switches had been left on. At approximately 1000 feet (300 m) asl and five miles (8 km) from the threshold, the flight crew had the approach lights and the PAPI in sight. It was not evident whether the PAPI was positioned on the right or the left side of the runway. The airport chart published by Jeppesen indicated ""PAPI L"" (left). In response to a query from the crew, the Bromont dispatcher indicated that the PAPI was on the right side of the runway. From his location facing the aircraft, the PAPI was to the dispatcher's right. The approach was continued visually, keeping to the left of the PAPI. At approximately two miles (3,2 km) from the runway threshold, the co-pilot noticed that the approach lights were at his right. He reported his observation to the captain, who paid little attention to it. Less than two seconds before the crash, the co-pilot asked the captain whether he had the runway in sight. The captain did not reply and continued the descent until the aircraft touched down 300 feet (90 m) to the left of runway 05L, 1800 feet (550 m) beyond the threshold. When the captain realized that he was not on the runway, he applied full power to execute a missed approach; however, the aircraft hit a ditch approximately four feet (1,20 m) deep that was perpendicular to the flight path. The nose wheel and right landing gear collapsed. The aircraft came to a stop facing back the way it had come, after travelling a distance of 1800 feet during which it made a full turn followed by a 180-degree turn. FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1. The flight crew attempted a night landing in the absence of runway edge lights. The aircraft touched down 300 feet to the left of Runway 05L and 1800 feet beyond the threshold. 2. The runway was not closed for night use despite the absence of runway edge lights. Nothing required it to be closed. 3. Poor flight planning, non-compliance with regulations and standard operating procedures (SOPs), and the lack of communications between the two pilots reveal a lack of airmanship on the part of the crew, which contributed to the accident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A05Q0024 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: TSB Report Number A05Q0024   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

As the captain continued to rotate the airplane, the tail section struck the ground, and the ""tail strike"" EICAS (Engine Indication and Crew Alerting System) message illuminated. The flight crew then completed the takeoff sequence, completed all checklists, jettisoned fuel, and returned to the airport where an uneventful landing was made. The winds recorded at the airport, about 1 minute after the accident, were from 280 degrees, at 21 knots, gusting to 28 knots. Review of the DFDR data revealed that at the time the takeoff roll began, the captain's control wheel was turned 25.5 degrees to the left, resulting in the upward deflection of the left wing outboard aileron, flaperon, and 6 of 7 spoilers, which was consistent with a correction for crosswind conditions. As the takeoff roll continued, the control wheel input varied between 19.6 degrees and 37.5 degrees to the left, and at the approximate point of rotation, the control wheel was turned to the left 38.4 degrees. The control column position also began to move aft at the point of rotation, with a force of 22.7 pounds, and the pitch of the airplane rose to 3 degrees nose up. As the pilot continued the rotation, he held the pitch control at a value consistent with previous recorded flights, before pulling the control column further aft, increasing the pitch angle to the tail strike attitude of approximately 13 degrees nose up. One second later, as both left and right main gear indicated no weight on wheels, the control column position reached its maximum value during the event, 9.2 degrees aft, and the pitch reached 17.8 degrees nose up. A Safety Board vehicle performance study compared the airspeed and groundspeed recorded during the accident, and determined that a wind gust caused an approximate 7 knot loss in airspeed, the lateral control wheel input during the rotation ranged from 24 to 37 degrees, and the maximum pitch rate during the rotation was approximately 6.0 degrees/second. Using these data in a Boeing estimation method, it was determined that three factors contributed to the reduced tail clearance during the takeoff. These factors were the loss of airspeed that resulted from a tailwind gust during the rotation, the loss of lift that resulted from the deflection of the lateral control surfaces, and a pitch rate in excess of that recommended. These factors combined for a total reduction in tail clearance of approximately 150-170 percent. It was concluded in the performance study that reducing the pitch rate to the Boeing recommended 2.5 degrees/second would have brought the tail clearance reduction to the 80 percent to 100 percent of nominal level, and from that point, a 1-knot increase in rotation speed would have provided about a 7 percent increase to the tail clearance margin. According to Boeing, the typical liftoff attitude was 8.5 degrees, the minimum tail clearance was 37 inches, and the tail strike pitch attitude was 12.1 degrees up. The operator's flight manual warned pilots to ""Avoid any tendency to rapidly rotate to a 10 degree pitch attitude and hold it until lift-off. This technique invites a tail strike."" In addition, neither Boeing, nor the operator, had procedures or policies for adding an increase in rotation speed to compensate for crosswind or tailwind conditions. Probable Cause: The captain's failure to follow company procedures, which resulted in a tail strike. Contributing were the gusty crosswind and tailwind conditions, and the manufacturer's failure to provide adequate performance planning data to account for gusty crosswinds during takeoff.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NYC05FA054 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 12 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB NYC05FA054 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates10-Oct-2022 16:47 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

After confirming no danger to their airplane, they discovered that one of the flight attendants had injured her elbow.  The captain returned the airplane to the gate, and the flight attendant was replaced.  Two additional flight attendants reported ""some bruising"" but felt able to continue the flight.  En route, one of the two flight attendants advised the captain of back pain, and the other felt sick to her stomach.   After landing, the two flight attendants were taken to a hospital for further evaluation.  One of the two flight attendants was released, but the other remained in the hospital in excess of 48 hours with a herniated disk.   According to the first officer, the reason he told the captain to stop was because another airplane was on the crossing runway.  The first officer thought it could be holding number one for takeoff, and wanted to ensure that his airplane was on the correct taxiway before crossing the runway.  Probable Cause: The first officer's misjudgment of a perceived threat, which resulted in the captain's excessive braking and subsequent injury to a flight attendant.

At the same time the reverser on the left engine was brought to maximum mode. The reverse thrust lever of the right engine was not used since the reverser was deactivated. After deceleration to a speed of 80 knots the reverse thrust lever of the left engine was brought to the intermediate position between maximum and minimum reverse thrust. As this was happening the throttle control lever of the right engine was brought from idle to the position of ~55 degrees according to FDR data. Further movement of the reverse thrust lever of the right engine was accompanied by the simultaneous shifting of the throttle control lever of the left engine practically as far as the nominal mode.  At this moment the airplane captain interfered in the control, shifted the throttle control lever of the right engine to idle and again activated maximum reverse of the left engine.

The two pilots and two passengers were not injured. Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight that departed Columbus-Port Columbus International Airport, Ohio. Prior to the day of the incident, the pilot and copilot had not flown together. In addition, the copilot spoke broken English. The copilot obtained the current ATIS information about 150 miles from the destination airport. Although the ATIS information reported thin slush on all surfaces, the captain had not asked about runway conditions, and the copilot did not relay the information regarding runway conditions.  The flightcrew continued the approach in moderate to severe turbulence, and performed pre-landing checks. Due to the turbulence, the flightcrew missed several radio transmissions, including the aircraft ahead them that reported a go-around, and later reported good braking action. The incident airplane turned onto final approach for runway 01; a 7,000-foot-long, 150-foot-wide, asphalt runway. During the final approach, the landing gear was down and flaps were in the 25-degree extended position. Air Traffic Control (ATC) relayed the good braking action report to the incident flightcrew, based upon the previous arrival aircraft. However, the previous arrival aircraft was equipped with thrust reversers, and the incident airplane was not. ATC also provided two wind checks to the incident airplane while on final approach. The wind checks were reported as 340 degrees at 15 knots, and 340 degrees at 20 knots, respectively. The pilot reported that due to the wind, he flew the final approach without full flaps, at Vref plus 20 (139 knots), and slowed to 134 knots over the runway threshold.  After touchdown the airplane failed to stop on the runway and overran.  The airplane came to rest approximately 230 feet beyond the departure end of runway 1. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The pilot in command's inadequate in-flight planning, which resulted in an overrun landing on a contaminated runway. Factors were inadequate crew coordination, gusty winds, and a slush covered runway.

During the flight, the #1 Hydraulic Low Pressure caution light illuminated. Due to this, the ground spoilers would not be available on landing and a 1.13 landing distance penalty was needed to be applied to the landing runway. The flight was cleared to land on runway 1L. The reported winds were 290 degrees at 10 knots, and the braking action was reported as fair. The captain reported the braking action was nil with no traction on the runway. The airplane departed the left side of the runway about 4,600 feet from the approach end of runway 1L. The airplane veered across the grass infield before crossing runway 07R/25L. The airplane traveled through the intersection of taxiways A, E, and T before crossing another snow-covered grass in-field where the aircraft went through a snow bank and back onto taxiway B. The airplane stopped near the intersection of taxiway B and M in front of concourse D. The captain reported that nothing appeared to be wrong with the airplane so the decision was made to taxi to gate E64.

The flight had departed LaGuardia International Airport en route to Milwaukee International Airport (MKE).  During climbout through Flight Level 20 (20,000 feet), the No. 1 Hydraulic Low Pressure caution light illuminated.  The flight crew ran the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) checklist for the caution message.  The procedures outlined in the QRH instructed the flight crew to: ""Land at the nearest suitable airport.""  The captain informed the airline's maintenance control about the caution message, but he did not inform flight dispatch about the caution message or the need to land at the nearest suitable airport.  The flight continued to its destination airport.  The flight was cleared to land on runway 1L.  The winds were 290 degrees at 10 knots.  The captain reported that the landing was normal until the airplane started to veer off the left side of the runway.  The post accident inspection of the airplane revealed no preexisting anomalies, other than the loss of the No. 1 Hydraulic system which resulted in the loss of ground spoilers.  The NTSB Aircraft Performance Study indicated that the airplane approached runway 1L crossing the threshold at about 2302:16 at a recorded radio altitude of about 50 feet above ground level, with an indicated airspeed of 139 knots (about 136 knots ground speed) and a pitch angle of about 4 degrees nose down.  The airplane began to drift right of centerline by about 20 feet, and touchdown occurred at a calculated distance of 2,400 feet beyond the runway threshold in a crab angle of about 5 degrees nose left relative to the ground track, and at a roll angle of about 1 degree left bank angle. The lateral load at touchdown was recorded at -0.2 G's. After touchdown, the airplane's ground track continued to drift right of centerline about 25 feet while the airplane nose remained to the left of the ground track. The airplane's ground track then began to turn left and departed off the side of the runway (veered off the runway) at about 2302:37 and approximately 4,200 feet beyond the threshold. The longitudinal acceleration from point of touchdown to when it veered off the runway was recorded between -0.12 and -0.15 G's.  An investigation of airport operations revealed that airport operations did not inspect Runway 1L/19R after a pilot report (PIREP) of NIL braking action by a Beech Jet at 2018.  Airport operations did not conduct or provide friction measurement reports and (Notices to Airmen) NOTAMS for Runway 1L/19R between March 10 at 1925 and the time of the accident on March 11 at 2302, when airport conditions were changing with significant snowfall accumulations.  The airport did not conduct a runway inspection or friction report of Runway 1L/19R after the airplane veered off the runway. Probable Cause: the captain's failure to adequately compensate for the crosswind conditions, and his failure to maintain directional control during landing.  Contributing factors include the captain's failure to land at the nearest suitable airport after an in-flight mechanical problem, the airport operation's failure to conduct runway friction tests and to issue NOTAMS in accordance with existing regulations, the crosswind, the snow-covered runway, the runway sign, and night conditions.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CHI05FA077 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB CHI05FA077 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  11 March 2005 N8932C Northwest Airlink, lsf Pinnacle Airlines 0 Milwaukee-General Mitchell International Airport, WI (MKE) sub Runway excursion Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates25-Mar-2024 09:35 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

CONCLUSIONS: ""The Aviation Accident Investigation Commission of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, determines on the probable cause(s) of the accident, as follows: The impact of the aircraft against the ground without loss of control due to the deficient dispatch, planning, execution of the Checklists and CRM of the crew allowing the takeoff and rotation run to start with overweight (25,798kgs) and 0Â° of flap since for a weight of 25,000kgs corresponded 15 Â° of flaps according to the Flight Manual of the aircraft. Likewise, the failure to abort the takeoff when the configuration alarm did not function.

The pilot allocated to the flight had not flown for 32 days; he was therefore required to complete a short flight at Glasgow to regain currency before landing to collect a paramedic for the flight to Campbeltown Airport. Poor weather at Campbeltown Airport necessitated an instrument approach. There was neither radar nor Air Traffic Control Service at the airport, so the pilot was receiving a Flight Information Service from a Flight Information Service Officer in accordance with authorised procedures. After arriving overhead Campbeltown Airport, the aircraft flew outbound on the approach procedure for runway 11 and began a descent. The pilot next transmitted that he had completed the Âbase turnÂ, indicating that he was inbound to the airport and commencing an approach. The airplane had gradually descended below the minimum altitude With a slight left wing low attitude, the airplane contacted the sea. It broke up after impact and sank. CAUSAL FACTORS:  ""1. The pilot allowed the aircraft to descend below the minimum altitude for the aircraftÂs position on the approach procedure, and this descent probably continued unchecked until the aircraft flew into the sea. 2. A combination of fatigue, workload and lack of recent flying practise probably contributed to the pilotÂs reduced performance. 3.

On the last leg of the flight, the pilots attempted a VFR approach, which was not permitted for this airport. The aircraft descended, below the glide slope as the crew mistook the motorway for the runway. They entered a sideslip for more than 20 seconds when the pilot tried to align with the 'runway' causing the aircraft to lose speed. A stall developed at a height of 26 metres and the left wing struck a sand heap 4217 metres before the runway threshold causing the aircraft to crash 30 metres further on. The Commission found that the cause of the crash was the collision of the aircraft with the ground at the final stage of the approach due to its exit to the overcritical angles of attack and the stalling regime (an off-flight flight regime) at low altitude. The deceleration of the aircraft to the stall speed was due to its withdrawal, as a result of the control actions of the commander of the aircraft, to the flight mode with slip and maintaining this mode for a long time (more than 20 seconds) with insufficient engine operation and lack of control by the crew of the airspeed. Possible errors in the indications of a number of instruments (speed indicators, angle of attack indicator) could make it difficult for crew members to control flight parameters.Sources: Aviatsiya.ru  Gazeta.ru  Michael Roch  Russian Ministry of Transport  RIA Novosti  ITAR-TASS   Location  Images: photo (c) Reynold Camilleri; Yakutsk Airport (YKS); 12 August 2003 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

A helicopter was called in the extinguish the fire. Since the fire spread rapidly, a second helicopter was ordered, but there were no helicopters available. The Department of Civil Protection was contacted to send a fire fighting airplane.  A Canadair CL-415 departed Roma-Ciampino Airport (CIA) at 16:28 on a fire fighting mission. It arrived at the scene of the fire at 17:20. After a survey of the scene the crew commenced their mission. At 18:04, immediately after releasing the water, the airplane contacted the cable guard of a power line. The right hand float separated from the wing and a fire erupted on the severed wing. The pilots lost control and the airplane came down in a residential area, crashing into an unoccupied house. PROBABLE CAUSES AND CAUSAL FACTORS (translated from Italian) The accident was triggered by the collision of the aircraft against the cable guard of a power line during a fire fighting mission. The collision was caused by an inadequate trajectory towards the front of the fire. The damage suffered as a result of the impact against the power line  seriously compromised the controllability of the aircraft, affecting a positive outcome of the emergency. The following causal factors may have contributed to the dynamics of the accident: - Poor decision making in attacking the fire, causing the crew to focus their attention on obstacles (pylons) of Power Line No 500, without considering the presence of the cable guard line n.550; - The reduced visibility of obstacles resulting from the smoke of the forest; - The inadequate reporting of electricity pylons and associated overhead lines; - Non-activation of the required radio links, so the crew could not receive reports on the presence of obstacles; - Short and discontinuous experience of the captain in that role, coming from the institution of the ""PIC Frozen""; - The combination of to similar qualified pilots (""PIC Frozen"") in the cockpit for the operation of a flight, one just rehabilitated to a high command function, the other still employed in the role of co-pilot: This condition could have a negative impact in terms of crew integration, obscuring decision making; - The existence of criticality in corporate manuals used at the date of the accident; - Reduced operational capacity of the crew in the last phase of flight, resulting from the strong heat of the fire under the left wing which penetrated the airplane through an opening created by the separation of a porthole.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ANSV Report number: - Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; January 2002 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The crew initially selected flaps 30% for the approach and then selected the landing gear down. The landing gear was reportedly slow to extend, however a 3-green gear down indication was eventually displayed. When the flaps were selected to 100% prior to landing, the gear unsafe aural warning sounded and the crew executed a missed approach. On the overshoot the gear was selected up, the 3 green indication remained and the landing gear unsafe light was illuminated. The crew chose to divert to Winnipeg where maintenance was available. While en route back to Winnipeg, the crew accomplished the relevant abnormal checklist (Landing with Landing Gear Unsafe), and declared an emergency. At no time did the 3 green indication extinguish. On arrival in Winnipeg after gear extension, the crew requested a fly-by, where ground personnel advised that the gear appeared to be down. The landing was accomplished successfully, however the aircraft was stopped on runway 36, in order to accomplish a visual inspection. At this time a crew member noticed that the nose gear was not fully extended, and attempted to move the gear into the locked position by pushing on it. The nose gear did move; however, the left main gear collapsed. Runway 36 was closed for about 5 hours while the aircraft was removed.Sources: CADORS 2005C0553  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane was to make scheduled refueling stops at Khartoum and Benghazi. The crew decided to take off from runway 30, heading towards Lake Victoria. The airplane was configured for a takeoff weight of 174 tons with the stabilizer set at -3.3 degrees. The actual weight was probably around 182 tons, which was still within limits. The aircraft lifted off the runway at 263 kph after rolling for about 2800 metres. It subsequently climbed to 29 m at which altitude it leveled off for 4.5 seconds. After that the airplane began to descend gradually. Four seconds into descent, the commander ordered the retraction of flaps. By this time the aircraft was already descending at the rate of 3.5 m/sec and the speed was increasing. At the last moment they noted that the descent and suddenly initiated a climb. The airplane then contacted the water and crashed. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The accident was caused by aircraft colliding with the water surface shortly after take off. While the aircraft had gathered sufficient energy to sustain climb, the crew failed to monitor altitude and react correctly in the short time that the aircraft was airborne. This resulted in the aircraft going into descent till it reached an altitude where recovery was not possible.

The aircraft operated on a round trip from Havana to Caracas and back. The first officer was pilot flying for the return leg. The initial part of the takeoff was performed by the captain. After reaching a speed of 150 km/h the captain handed over the flight controls to the first officer. After passing through 220-230 km/h, the pilot noticed that he had no control of the elevator and immediately reported the failure to the captain, who again took the controls to verify the anomaly. During this check, approximately 11 seconds passed and the airplane's speed reached 282 km/h, while covering some 693 meters. The aircraft now had covered a total runway distance of 2230 meters, leaving 815 meters of runway remaining for braking. The takeoff was aborted but the aircraft was not able to stop on the remaining runway. The landing gear separated after running over a channel located approximately 20 meters after the runway. The aircraft came to a stop on a downslope. CAUSES:  Human Factor, Material Factor and Physical Factor and taking into account the characteristics of the Accident and the evidence gathered during the course of the investigation, considers the Human Factor as the causal factor of this accident due to the following: - The flight crew did not perform the respective manual check of the flight controls (elevators). - The flight crew did not perform the visual check on the panel of the locked/red and unlocked/green warning lights of the flight control surfaces (ailerons, elevators, directional rudder). - There was no adequate Cockpit Management, or assertive behavior by the crew, in terms of decision making during the takeoff abort. - There were no accurate calculations for takeoff speed references (V1-Vr-V2) in analogy to takeoff weights. - The evacuation of the passengers was not efficient and correct, since it was evidenced that the exit of the passengers was carried out through the least convenient doors, due to the position of the aircraft, which had to be blocked by the cabin crew. - There was no deployment of the slides for evacuation, which resulted in some passengers suffering dislocated limbs when they had to jump.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JIAAC Venezuela Report number: 017/2005 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: Agencia Cubana de Noticias   Location  Images: photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Havana-JosÃ© MartÃ­ International Airport (HAV/MUHA); January 2004 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

During takeoff from Mukalla's runway 06, at the speed 225 km/h, the nose landing gear retracted. The captain decided to abort the takeoff. He steered the plane to the left to avoid a collision with a radio-technical equipment car. The aircraft failed to stop on the runway and ran onto rugged sand terrain, 2 m below the runway level. The aircraft hit a hill and tilted to the right as it came to rest 400m from the runway end and 30m left from extended runway center line. Conclusions: The reason of this occurrence is early retraction of landing gears without order of the Captain before aircraft airborne. Actions of flight engineer in violation of technology of standard operating procedures, by fixing of landing gear switch to ""retract position"" after that to ""neutral"" without report to the Captain leaded to rise and development of occurrence.Sources: Arab News  Accident investigation final report   Location  Images: photo (c) Gerry & Bonni; Mukalla-Al-Rayyan International Airport (MKX); November 2011; (CC:by) photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Sharjah Airport (SHJ); 22 February 2004 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The controller cleared them for the approach, reported wind calm, pressure 29.94 in. Hg, a temperature of 26 degrees and requested the crew to report on finals. At 09:54:29 the crew reported on finals and were cleared to land. The F-28 touched down 4,5 meters short of runway 15 and struck the raised lip of the runway threshold. It continued for 112 m before veering to the left off the runway. The airplane ran another 263 m before it skidded to a stop against the wall of a company building. Runway 15 is a 2000 m long asphalt runway. Investigation revealed that the pilots thought the Coca runway was short. To be able to stop the plane on the runway without excessive use of the brakes, they decided to touch down as close to the threshold as possible.

They turned to an agricultural field where an emergency landing was performed. On touchdown the airplane swung, sustaining substantial damage. Causes and contributing factors (translated from original Spanish report): 1. Operation with four consecutive flights made by the same crew to Chagual aerodrome (an aerodrome that demands a high alertness and situational awareness due to difficult topographical conditions), a long and exhausting day flying and working together with the multiple functions performed by the technical crew (dispatcher, payer, loader, cabin crew) probably decreased the performance and capacity of the technical crew and safety. 2. Poor planning on the part of the Operations and Sales Management of the Aero Condor Company Charter, by not providing the NOTAM which showed the lack of JET A1 fuel in Trujillo causing programming, operational and logistic difficulties.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIAA Report number: CIAA-ACCID-006-2005 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Images: photo (c) Capt.

He approached the airport from the northeast overflew the airport, and made a left turn to enter the downwind leg for runway 23. He saw some parachutes on the ground and some in the air. He saw a tandem jumper toward the southwest and believed he had accounted for all jumpers.  As he turned left, he saw a flash of colors, felt an impact and drag from the left wing. He got the airplane on the ground as soon as possible. Radar data indicated that the airplane was about 1,300 feet msl when it was approaching runway 5/23 from the northeast. The airplane flew over runway 23, near mid field, about 1,100 feet msl and was between 900 to 800 feet msl during the left bank entering the downwind for runway 23; last capture was at 300 feet as it approached runway 23. One jumper stated the parachute landing zone was located on the airport adjacent to the left side of runway 30. The video equipment that was carried by the cinematographer captured the collision. The cinematographer jumps with the last tandem jumpers. The tandem chute deploys at 3 minutes and 7 seconds into the video, 13 seconds later the cinematographer's chute deploys. During his descent, he removes the helmet-mounted camera and looks into the view making a few remarks about the jump. He places the camera back to its original position and continues to capture; the sky is overcast and visibility is good. The view pans to the right and captures three skydivers with chutes deployed at an altitude above him. At approximately 4 minutes and 54 seconds into the video, a sound similar to an airplane engine can be heard at an increasing level for 5 seconds. At 4 minutes and 59 seconds, the view pans slightly left and a sound similar to an impact is heard. The view becomes blurry and pans rapidly. At 5 minutes and 2 seconds, three frames capture what appears to be an aircraft in close proximity banking away and to the right of the camera's view. The view continues to pan rapidly for about 6 seconds showing shots of the ground, sky, and parachute. The camera stabilizes and records until impact with the ground at 5 minutes and 46 seconds. One of the master tandem jumpers on that jump stated that the pilot did not give a briefing on which runway or approach he was going to use. The norm is for the jumpers to avoid crossing runways below 1,000 feet and to stay away about 300 feet from the runways, and the pilot to avoid jumpers at all time. Due to the amount of jumps that are performed per day there is no briefing before each flight. Approaches and runway selection depends on the individual pilot. A representative of the operator stated that only verbal guidance is given to the pilots to follow the FAA rules and it up to their discretion for approaches and runway selection. The acting airport manager stated that there is no agreement for airport operations between the skydive operator and the city, only the lease agreement. The city did develop a voluntary noise abatement procedure outlining areas to avoid. The several pilots at the airport stated that for several years they communicated with the city regarding safety concerns with approaches and runway selection by the skydive operator. They stated the city did not correct the situation.  Probable Cause: The pilot's inadequate visual lookout.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: MIA05LA096 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB MIA05LA096 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  4 April 2019 N24HV Vertical Air Inc 0 DeLand Municipal Airport (KDED/DED), Volusia County, FL unk Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates10-Oct-2022 14:37 ASN Update Bot Added 18-Nov-2024 16:52 The2ndBaron Updated [Total fatalities, Other fatalities, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

On April 25 they left Verkhnyaya Khava and flew to an area 4 km north of the city for another crop spraying mission. The captain did not judge the wind direction adequately, so the airplane attempted to takeoff from the area with a tailwind component. Direction could not be maintained due to the wind. The pilot did not use the brakes to maintain directional control. The airplane did not achieve the speed necessary to lift off (99 km/h). The pilot pulled on the controls, but could not lift the An-2 off the ground. It ran onto a freshly ploughed field and overturned. A fire erupted in the engine but this was quickly contained by the crew with the aid of an onboard fire extinguisher.

On board the aircraft, a DHC-8-103 with registration LN-WIK, were a crew of two pilots and one cabin attendant, 26 passengers and one passive cabin attendant.  During the approach to Hammerfest the crew was informed about variable and occasional gusty wind from south-east. The wind direction favoured runway 23 and the crew planned the landing accordingly. The copilot was Pilot Flying (PF) and the commander was Pilot Not Flying (PNF). The copilot was newly hired and was flying under supervision. The crew was kept updated on the wind conditions by the AFIS operator, and at times the gusty wind conditions favoured runway 05. The copilot left the control to the commander who continued the approach to runway 05. Just before landing the wind direction veered to the right and increased in strength, resulting in a significant tail wind component. This resulted in a marked increase in the descent rate which the commander tried to stop by advancing to full power. However, the altitude was too low and the airplane touched down hard just inside the runway edge on runway 05. At touch down the right main landing gear leg failed. The airplane slid on the belly, right partly retracted main wheel and wing tip for some 650 m, and stopped just after the second (TWY B) turnoff to the apron. The fire and rescue vehicles were quickly at the scene and sprayed foam on the plane to prevent fire. The cabin attendant calmed the passengers who wanted to get out of the plane quickly due to smoke and burned smell in the cabin. It took 33 seconds from the commander's order to evacuate until this was actually initiated. The delay was mainly caused by the fact that the order did not get through the cabinÂs Public Address (PA) system. The investigations show that WiderÃ¸e permitted landings in up to the maximum demonstrated cross wind component of 36 kt and in up to 10 kt tail wind during short field operations.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIBN Report number: AIBN SL 2009/22 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 years and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Aftenposten  WiderÃ¸e   Location  Images: photo (c) AIBN; Hammerfest Airport (HFT); 01 May 2005; (publicdomain) photo (c) AIBN; Hammerfest Airport (HFT); 01 May 2005; (publicdomain) photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Oslo-Gardermoen Airport (OSL/ENGM); 08 August 2004 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The payload comprised 1790 kilograms (kg) of courier packs and parcel mail. Loading of the freight was delayed, being completed at about 21:15. The crew ordered 570 litres (about 1000 pounds or 450 kg) of additional fuel and instructed the refueller to put it all into the left wing tank, rather than put half of the ordered amount into each tank, as was company practice. Refuelling was completed at 21:30. Two minutes later the flight taxied out to runway 23R. Takeoff was performed at 21:36. The aircraft climbed to an altitude of FL220 with the autopilot engaged for the climb and cruise. At cruise altitude the climb power remained set for about 15 minutes in order to make up some of the delay caused by the late departure. At about 22:12:28, after power was reduced to a cruise setting and the cruise checks had been completed, the captain noted some fuel imbalance and decided to carry out further fuel balancing. He said, ""WeÂll just open the crossflow again ..sit on left ball and trim it accordingly"". The captain repeated the instruction 5 times in a period of 19 seconds, by telling the first officer to, ""Step on the left pedal, and just trim it to take the pressure off"" and ""Get the ball out to the right as far as you can ..and just trim it"". The first officer sought confirmation of the procedure and said, ""I was being a bit cautious"" to which the captain replied, ""DonÂt be cautious mate, itÂll do it good"". These instructions resulted in the aircraft being flown at a large sideslip angle by the use of the rudder trim control while the autopilot was engaged. Forty-seven seconds after opening the crossflow, the captain said, ""DoesnÂt like that one mate.. youÂd better grab it."" Within one second there was the aural alert ""Bank angle"", followed by a chime tone, probably the selected altitude deviation warning. Both pilots exclaimed surprise. The autopilot had probably disengaged automatically because a servo reached its torque limit, allowing the aircraft to roll and dive abruptly as a result of the applied rudder trim. The crew was unable to recover control from the ensuing spiral dive before airspeed and g limits were grossly exceeded, resulting in the structural failure and in-flight break-up of the aircraft. The flying conditions of a dark night with cloud cover below probably made it more difficult to notice the developing upset at an early stage. The break-up probably started when the aircraft was quite high, perhaps FL199. The wreckage was scattered over a large area of at least two to three square km of rural farmland.

The flight was operated by Transair but conducted on behalf of Aero-Tropics Air Services. Aero-Tropics would provide ground handling, pilot briefing facilities and marketing services. Transair provided the airplane and crew. The Metro 23 aircraft departed Cairns at 08:31. During the descent to Lockhart River on the northbound flight, the crew intended to perform a runway 30 RNAV (GNSS) approach. Late in the approach, the crew appropriately manoeuvred the aircraft to land on runway 12. The engines were shutdown at 09:50. The aircraft departed Lockhart River at 09:58 and arrived at Bamaga at 10:39. The aircraft was refuelled at Bamaga for the return flight to Cairns via Lockhart River to collect two passengers. The pilot in command commented to the ground agent prior to departing Bamaga that the weather was 'bad' at Lockhart River and it may not be possible to land there. The forecast conditions at the aerodrome included a broken10 cloud base 1,000 ft above the aerodrome for periods of up to 60 minutes. The aircraft departed Bamaga at 11:07 and climbed to the cruising altitude of FL170. Descent was commenced at 11:32. Three minutes later the copilot advised Brisbane ATC that the aircraft was on descent, passing 10,000 ft AMSL with an estimated time of arrival at Lockhart River of 11:38. At 11:39 the copilot broadcast on the CTAF (Common Traffic Advisory Frequency) that the crew was conducting the runway 12 RNAV (GNSS) approach, and that the aircraft was at the 'Whisky Golf' (LHRWG) waypoint and tracking for the 'Whisky India' (LHRWI) waypoint. At 11:41 the airplane was over the LHRWI intermediate fix and descent was recommenced at 4.8 NM from the LHRWF waypoint. This was 3.1 NM before the descent point specified on the approach chart for the 3.49 degree constant angle approach path to the missed approach point. After levelling briefly at 3000 feet 18 degrees of flaps were selected. The aircraft then commenced descent 1.4 NM before the final approach fix (FAF). This was 0.3 NM (approximately 7 seconds) after the descent point specified for the constant angle approach path. The average rate of descent was 1000 ft/min, increasing to 1700 ft/min. At 11:43 the Metro was over the FAF at an altitude of 2379 feet. The altitude at this stage should have been 2860 feet. The flight descended then through the segment minimum safe altitude of 2,060 ft. It continued to descend until it flew into the side of a heavily timbered ridge in the Iron Range National Park. The height of the initial impact with trees was 1,210 ft, which was about 90 ft below the crest of the ridge. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS RELATING TO OCCURRENCE EVENTS AND INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS - The crew commenced the Lockhart River Runway 12 RNAV (GNSS) approach, even though the crew were aware that the copilot did not have the appropriate endorsement and had limited experience to conduct this type of instrument approach. - The descent speeds, approach speeds and rate of descent were greater than those specified for the aircraft in the Transair Operations Manual. The speeds and rate of descent also exceeded those appropriate for establishing a stabilised approach. - During the approach, the aircraft descended below the segment minimum safe altitude for the aircraft's position on the approach. - The aircraft's high rate of descent, and the descent below the segment minimum safe altitude, were not detected and/or corrected by the crew before the aircraft collided with terrain. - The accident was almost certainly the result of controlled flight into terrain. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS RELATING TO LOCAL CONDITIONS - The crew probably experienced a very high workload during the approach. - The crew probably lost situational awareness about the aircraft's position along the approach. - The pilot in command had a previous history of conducting RNAV (GNSS) approaches with crew without appropriate endorsements, and operating the aircraft at speeds higher than those specified in the Transair Operations Manual. - The Lockhart River Runway 12 RNAV (GNSS) approach probably created higher pilot workload and reduced position situational awareness for the crew compared with most other instrument approaches. This was due to the lack of distance referencing to the missed approach point throughout the approach, and the longer than optimum final approach segment with three altitude limiting steps. - The copilot had no formal training and limited experience to act effectively as a crew member during a Lockhart River Runway 12 RNAV (GNSS) approach. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS RELATING TO TRANSAIR PROCESSES - Transair's flight crew training program had significant limitations, such as superficial or incomplete ground-based instruction during endorsement training, no formal training for new pilots in the operational use of GPS, no structured training on minimising the risk of controlled flight into terrain, and no structured training in crew resource management and operating effectively in a multi-crew environment. (Safety Issue) - Transair's processes for supervising the standard of flight operations at the Cairns base had significant limitations, such as not using an independent approved check pilot to review operations, reliance on passive measures to detect problems, and no defined processes for selecting and monitoring the performance of the base manager. (Safety Issue) - Transair's standard operating procedures for conducting instrument approaches had significant limitations, such as not providing clear guidance on approach speeds, not providing guidance for when to select aircraft configuration changes during an approach, no clear criteria for a stabilised approach, and no standardised phraseology for challenging safety-critical decisions and actions by other crew members. (Safety Issue) - Transair had not installed a terrain awareness and warning system, such as an enhanced ground proximity warning system, in VH-TFU. - Transair's organisational structure, and the limited responsibilities given to non-management personnel, resulted in high work demands on the chief pilot. It also resulted in a lack of independent evaluation of training and checking, and created disincentives and restricted opportunities within Transair to report safety concerns with management decision making. (Safety Issue) - Transair did not have a structured process for proactively managing safetyrelated risks associated with its flight operations. (Safety Issue) - Transair's chief pilot did not demonstrate a high level of commitment to safety.

The flight was carried out by DC-9-51 N763NC. After takeoff, at some point below 4,000 feet altitude, when the slats were retracted, the MASTER CAUTION light illuminated. The co-pilot, who was pilot flying, observed the RUDDER CONTROL MANUAL annunciator light and then saw that the right hydraulic system pressure was about 1,000 pounds per square inch (PSI). The right engine hydraulic pump switch was selected to 'off' and the flight was continued while the captain referred to the NWA DC-9 Cockpit Operating Manual (COM) to complete the procedures. He also discussed the problem with maintenance control on the ground. The approach and landing at Minneapolis were briefed thoroughly. Approximately 18:50, the captain contacted dispatch to request that they ""call out the trucks"" for their arrival. At 19:01 the captain radioed to MSP center ""ah we got a hydraulic problem, we're gonna go ahead and declare an emergency. ah everything should be okay but just gonna have to land a little faster and we're gonna have the trucks standing and everything."" The landing gear was extended early in the approach because the crew was uncertain if they would have to use the Emergency Gear Extension Handle. This was not necessary as the gear extended successfully. The first officer flew a long slow downwind from Farmington to a downwind leg to runway 22. He turned onto the localizer course at an altitude about 3,000 feet. The flight was then cleared for the approach to runway 22. A safe landing was carried out at 19:23. After landing the flaps were retracted and the After Landing checklist was completed. The crew received taxi instructions, and after crossing runway 30L, he made a right turn onto taxiway A. They made a slight gradual turn into the gate area. He had just started to turn into the gate from taxiway A when the nose wheel steering failed. The first officer then advised Ground Control that they were experiencing steering problems and would probably have to be towed to the gate. He then called MAINT and told them the same thing. Then the captain  lost the brakes. The first officer stated that he saw the captain's hands ""come up"" and apply reverse thrust. The airplane came to a stop. The first officer stated that he called maintenance again and told them that they had lost steering and brakes and that they needed to have the airplane chocked. maintenance asked if they would shut down the engines and the captain said, no, he needed them first officer the reversers. The first officer stressed that they needed to get somebody out there right away; they were in a very precarious situation. maintenance said they would have somebody out as soon as they could.

While taxiing westbound to the gate, airport operations requested him to hold on the taxiway between A4 and A5, to give a Delta Air Lines pushback crew some room to move another airplane. After stopping, he set the brakes, and made a passenger announcement. Approximately 3 minutes later, the airplane was struck from the left rear by a snowplow. The force of the impact pushed the left main landing gear forward approximately 10 feet, turning the airplane to the right as it rotated about its right main landing gear. The captain stated that he shut down the engines, requested an assessment from the flight attendants, and told the first officer to call for fire equipment. He then surveyed the damage from the cockpit window and aft galley service door window. By that time, the snowplow had backed off to the east approximately 50 yards. The captain stated that the airport visibility was reported at 2 miles. However, he could see the Western State ""W"" on a hill, approximately 2.5 miles south of the airport. After an assessment of the damage and confirmation from the fire crew that it was safe, the airplane was towed to the ramp and the passengers were deplaned with the airstairs. The snow plow operator stated visibility was poor.  He said he was unsure of where the airplane was.  As he was plowing the taxiway ""out of nowhere was the 737.""  The driver applied brakes, but it was too late.  Following the accident, the airport made several changes to its operating procedures with respect to snowplow operations and radio communications with airport vehicles.  Probable Cause: the snowplow driver's failure to see the airplane during plowing operations.  Factors contributing to the accident were the snowplow driver's excessive speed and the snow.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DEN05LA048 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DEN05LA048 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates10-Oct-2022 18:27 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

Gelabert Airport towards the threshold of runway 36 for a flight to ChitrÃ©. During taxiing, the captain noticed that the nose wheel steering lever was stiffer than normal. Despite this, he continued to taxi, but because the lever remained stiff, he decided to contact the company operations and the Control Tower to return to the platform. On returning, at the turn between taxiways echo and alpha, the captain lost the effectiveness of the brakes and steering, causing the aircraft to crash into the hangar of the Mapiex company, damaging the aircraft and the wall of the hangar. CONCLUSIONS: The cause of the accident was due to a failure in the hydraulic system's pump pressure, which made it impossible for the crew to control the aircraft's braking and steering.

Weather at Manchester however was foggy and the pilot was unable to land there. The pilot then requested to proceed to his alternate destination, Burlington. During the flight to Burlington, the pilot was contacted by company dispatch and it was agreed that Bennington would be a better destination because it was 45 miles closer than Burlington. As the flight progressed towards Bennington, the pilot contacted ATC and requested to change his destination to Keene. Weather at Keene included winds from 350 degrees at 3 knots; 1 statute mile of visibility; an overcast cloud layer at 100 feet agl. The Bandeirante flew an ILS approach to runway 02. When the airplane broke out of the clouds, it was not stable. Approaching the runway, at full flaps and exceeding the 25 percent maximum for a go-around, the pilot added full power to the left engine. The high power setting, slow airspeed, and full flaps combination resulted in a minimum control speed (Vmc) roll. No determination could be made as to why the right engine was inoperative, and there were no mechanical or fuel-related anomalies found that would have precluded normal operation. The airplane came to rest inverted on runway 02, about 90 feet from the approach end. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The pilot's improper decision to attempt a single-engine missed approach with the airplane in a slow airspeed, full flap configuration, which resulted in a minimum control speed (Vmc) roll. Contributing factors included an inoperative engine for undetermined reasons, the pilot's in-flight decision to divert to an airport with low ceilings and visibility while better conditions existed elsewhere, the pilot's failure to advise or seek assistance from air traffic control or his company, and the low cloud ceilings, fog, and night lighting conditions.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NYC05FA042 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, TX (DFW); May 1989 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft had earlier departed the aerodrome on a charter flight with one pilot and seven passengers on board. The pilot had elected to return to the airport after detecting a problem during the retraction of the aircraft's landing gear. He attempted to manually extend the landing gear, but was unable to confirm that the landing gear had locked in position for the subsequent precautionary landing. The main landing gear collapsed as the aircraft touched down. Examination of the aircraft landing gear by the aircraft operator revealed an incorrectly installed thrust bearing in the hydraulic actuator for the left main landing gear. The result was that the axial loads normally carried by the thrust bearing were transferred to the actuator's pinion gears which fractured under abnormal operational loads. That damage seized the actuator and prevented the manual extension of the aircraft's landing gear by the pilot.Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  9 April 2007 VH-SGT Network Aviation Australia 0 Perth Airport, WA (PER) sub Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Estimated flying time was 1 hour and 29 minutes. The copilot was Pilot Flying. Weather at the destination, Oviedo-Asturias Airport, was poor with rain, fog and a cloud base of 300 ft. The flight crew decided to hold at FL100 over the Asturias VOR. The captain assumed the role of Pilot Flying at this time. Once the weather improved, approaches to runway 29 resumed. Two aircraft landed before flight JK5811 without reporting any problems. Since the cloud base was between 200 and 400 ft, the flight was force to make an ILS approach to runway 29, which meant a landing with a tail wind as winds were reported from 050Â° at 10 kt with gusts to 18 kt. The tail wind component was calculated to be 5-9,5 knots and the aircraft's tail wind limit was 10 knots. When the aircraft was at 270 ft, the crew reported runway in sight. Nine seconds later and twelve seconds before touchdown, the captain disconnected the autopilot. The autothrottle system remained active. Descent rate fluctuated, at times reaching 1000 ft/min. The pilot stated that at about 50 ft he observed an uncommanded descent of the aircraft and tried to compensate by increasing the engine thrust. On touchdown the vertical acceleration reached 4.11g. The aircraft bounced and touched down again, with one of the wheels hitting a runway edge light on the right hand side. Spoilers then extended and the thrust reversers were activated by the crew. The aircraft decellerated normally and taxied to the platform. Substantial damage to the airframe was noted. The captain sustained serious spinal injuries. He was briefly incapacitated after the first touchdown, forcing the copilot to take control during the bounce. Causes (translated from Spanish): It is considered that the probable cause of the accident was a significant variation in the intensity and wind direction at the time of landing prompting a 4.11g vertical acceleration, however, with the weather information available, it could not be determined if there were objective conditions for the possibility of windshear during landing. A contributing factor was the maneuver made by the aircraft, which is not consistent with a standard maneuver, since it there were variations in pitch, from 84 ft radio altimeter and a decrease of the plane relative to the ILS glide slope combined with the performance of autothrotle at idle and possible variations of wind in the final phase of landing which would place the aircraft on a path other than the nominal.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIAIAC Report number: A-013/2005 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 years and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The en route part of the flight was uneventful. The flight crew established radio contact with DÃ¼sseldorf Radar at 05:43. The crew were told that runway 23L was in use.  Two minutes later the radar controller contacted flight 8995: ""I just talked to the tower and ah for the time being braking action on all parts of the runway is supposed to be good. They are measuring again right now because it started to snow again and I'll keep you advised."" The flight was then cleared to descend to FL80. The flight crew decided to set the autobrakes for landing on Medium, to account for the snow. At 05:50 the radar controller again contacted the flight about the current weather circumstances: ""...latest update on the weather situation ahm the friction tester has reported braking action to be good for the moment however as its continuing to snow they are ah afraid that it might worsen, so they are going to do another friction test right before you land."" In the following minutes the flight was given descent instructions and vectors for an approach to runway 23L. At 05:54 the controller radioed: ""weather update we now have a surface wind of three four zero degrees eleven knots, that's slight tail wind component by two knots. Visibility is down to one thousand five hundred meters, still in snow showers and ah cloud base is now five hundred feet only."" The flight was subsequently cleared for the approach. At 05:57 the radar controller instructed the crew to contact DÃ¼sseldorf Tower. The Tower controller stated: ""Good morning,... we are just waiting for the braking action values from the friction tester stand by a second. The surface wind is actually three three zero degrees one two knots."" Two minutes later the controller radioed: ""... the braking action was measured to be medium at all parts. And ah the visibility dropped right now due to the heavy snow showers at the field ah. The RVR value at the touch down zone is presently nine hundred meters, at the mid-point one thousand one hundred meters and ah stop end one thousand one hundred meters."" At that moment the flight was 3,5 nautical miles out. The flight was subsequently cleared to land. The airplane touched down about 1700 ft (518 m) past the runway threshold. Ground spoilers and thrust reversers deployed and the autobrakes activated. Still the airplane did not decelerate as expected and the pilot applied manual braking. The airplane failed to stop and overran the runway end. It collided with ILS aerials, which caused a fire in engines no. 2 and no. 3. The aircraft was withdrawn from use at DÃ¼sseldorf until being scrapped there in April 2006. Causes: The accident is attributable to the fact that the braking values transmitted to the crew did not meet the conditions that had arisen as a result of heavy snowfall since the last measurement on the runway. Contributing factors: - Fast changing weather - The lack of an in all weather conditions reliable measurement method for the determination of braking coefficient.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BFU Report number: BFU AX001-05 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 8 years and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) Felix Goetting; DÃ¼sseldorf Airport (DUS); 24 January 2005 photo (c) Felix Goetting; DÃ¼sseldorf Airport (DUS); 24 January 2005 photo (c) Felix Goetting; DÃ¼sseldorf Airport (DUS); 24 January 2005 photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Miami International Airport, FL (MIA); February 2000 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Night instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The flight was en route to MCI to pick up passengers and continue on as an on-demand charter but diverted to the Kansas City-Charles B. Wheeler Downtown Airport (MKC) following the closure of MCI. MCI was closed due to a McDonnell Douglas MD83 sliding off a taxiway during an after landing taxi on contaminated runway/taxiway conditions. MKC held a limited airport certificate that did not have a snow removal plan and was served by runway 19 (7,002 feet by 150 feet, grooved asphalt). Following a precision approach and landing on runway 19 at MKC, the Learjet 35A slid off the departure end of the runway and impacted airport property and terrain. The Learjet 35A was operated with inoperative thrust reversers as per the airplane's minimum equipment list at the time of the accident. About 1:05 hours before the accident, runway 19 Tapley values were recorded as 21-22-22 with 1/2 inch of wet snow. About 17 minutes before the accident, MKC began snow removal operations. About 7 minutes before the accident, the MKC air traffic control tower (TWR) instructed the snow removal vehicles to clear the runway for inbound traffic. TWR was advised by airport personnel that runway 19 was plowed and surface conditions were 1/4 inch of snow of snow; friction values were not taken or reported. While inbound, the Learjet 35A requested any braking action reports from TWR. The first airplane to land was a Cessna 210 Centurion, and the pilot reported braking action to the TWR as ""moderate"", which was then transmitted by TWR as ""fair"" from a Centurion in response to the Learjet 35A's query. The Cessna 210 Centurion pilot did not use brakes during landing and did not indicate this to TWR during his braking action report. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The contaminated runway conditions during landing.

There were no injuries among the 22 passengers and three crew members. Danish Air Transport flight DTR54 was on a scheduled flight from Bergen to FlorÃ¸ (FRO). During takeoff the pilots experienced considerable control problems related to the elevator function. They declared an emergency situation and returned for landing. The landing was accomplished without further incident 7 minutes after takeoff. After landing it was found that the control problems were caused by the right elevator hanging below the horizontal stabiliser, attached only by the inboard of the three hinges that normally connect the elevator to the stabiliser. A bolt was missing from both the centre and outer hinges. Both of the bolts and one of the nuts that normally should connect the hinge assemblies together were found. One of the bolts was found on the runway, the other inside the elevator. Investigation indicates that the bolt belonging to the outer hinge assembly fell out during the takeoff in question, while the bolt in the centre hinge assembly had fallen out at an earlier point in time, without being discovered. The report concludes that the self-locking nuts cannot have been tightened with the required torque when the elevator was fitted. This error was most probably introduced after the aircraft was repainted in 1999. Significant investigation results: The control problems experienced by the crew during take-off and the rest of the flight began when the outboard of the three hinge bolts that attach the right elevator to the stabiliser loosened and fell out. As the centre bolt had fallen out at an earlier point in time without being discovered, the elevator was hanging in place only attached by the inboard hinge. The self-locking nuts that should hold the centre and outboard hinge bolts in place cannot have been tightened with the required torque.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIBN Report number: 8/2006 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) AIBN; Bergen-Flesland Airport (BGO); 31 January 2005; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft was owned by Nord-Flyg and operated under the name NTD Air Cargo. After landing, the pilot taxied to apron number four in the southeastern corner of the aerodrome and unloaded the cargo from Sweden. After having done that he left the airport and went to a suite the company reserves for the crew to rest before the return leg to Sweden, which was planned for the following afternoon. As per standard policy, the company operates the aircraft with a two person crew. On the day in question the co-pilot had taken ill and the pilot had flown alone. The return leg to Sweden was also planned as a one-person crew flight. The following morning the aircraft was refuelled with 420 l of Jet A-1, in accordance with the pilotÂs instructions. All in all ca. 725 kg of fuel was reserved for the return leg. It had been snowing at the airport until 11:20 and the temperature was hovering at around zero degrees Celsius. After having arrived at the airport at 16:30, the pilot began to brush the accumulated snow and frozen snow melt off the upper surfaces of the aircraft. As per his account, there was a great deal of snow and ice on the aircraft. He did not, however, manage to brush all of the impurities off of the surfaces of the aircraft. The cargo going to Sweden did not arrive in time for him to fly it to Skavsta, his primary destination. Therefore, he phoned in a change to the flight plan choosing Ãrebro instead as his destination.  At 18:52:45 the pilot acknowledged on Helsinki Control Tower (TWR) that he was taxiing to takeoff position runway 22L at intersection Y. At 16:54:40 TWR gave him takeoff clearance from that intersection and gave him the wind direction. The pilot later said that he executed a normal takeoff, using 10 degrees of flaps. The aircraft lifted off at the normal speed of 80-90 kts. All went well until he reached the height of 800-1000 ft (250-300 m) and retracted the trailing edge flaps. Immediately after flap retraction, the pilot lost control of the aircraft, which began turning to the right. The pilot attempted to fly the aircraft to the end section of runway 22R to make an emergency landing but the aircraft crashed into the terrain between the runways. DIRECT CAUSAL FACTORS: ""The chain of events can be regarded as having begun when the aeroplane stood overnight on the tarmac, exposed to the weather. Snowfall accumulated on the upper surfaces of the fuselage, wings and stabilizers during the night forming a thick coat of ice and snow as it partly melted during the day and refroze when the ambient temperature dropped towards the evening.  The pilot noticed the impurities when he performed a walkaround check. However, he did not order a de-icing. Instead, he tried to remove the ice with a brush. It is only possible to remove dry and loose snow by brushing. In this case the frozen water that had trickled down remained stuck to surfaces. The pilot executed a takeoff with an aircraft whose aerodynamic properties were fundamentally degraded due to impurities. During the initial climb, immediately after flap retraction, airflow separated from the surface of the wing and the pilot did not manage to regain control of the aircraft. The pilot did not recognize the stall for what is was and did not act in the required manner to recover or, then again, it could be that he had not received sufficient training for these kinds of situations."" cONTRIBUTING CAUSAL FACTORS: ""Several factors are considered to have affected the pilotÂs actions. He was either ignorant or negligent as to the effect of impurities on the aeroplaneÂs aerodynamic properties. Furthermore, the pressure of keeping to the schedule during the early preflight briefing activities may have affected his decision, even though a change in the flight plan eliminated the actual rush. It is the impression of the investigation commission that these factors were the principal ones that contributed to the omission of proper deicing. A probable contributing factor, albeit one difficult to verify, could have been the financial aspect. The company may have considered buying de-icing services from an external service provider as an additional expense. Investigations showed that the operator in question had ordered aeroplane de-icing at HelsinkiÂVantaa airport only once during the previous and ongoing winter season. The company regularly flew to this airport. Processes were in place for pre-flight briefing as well as for freight forwarding. However, the flight schedules with reference to the opening times of the companyÂs primary destination airport did not allow for long delays in ground operations. This may have partly put pressure on the pilot to complete the other pre-flight activities as soon as possible. As for the flap setting, the pilotÂs takeoff technique was not proper for the existing circumstances. Moreover, when the aeroplane stalled, the pilot did not execute any effective corrective action to regain control of the aircraft. These would have been, among other things: having reset the flaps to the position prior to the stall as well as having taken advantage of the engine power reserve. As per his account, the pilot did not utilize all available engine power. Instead, he stuck to the maximum value prescribed for normal operations as specified in the aircraft operations manual. The fact that the said flight was flown, contrary to normal operations with only a one person crew, can be considered a contributing factor.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIB Finland Report number: B2/2005L Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ    Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

When takeoff speed was reached the pilot tried to lift the plane off the runway but, according to his statement the control wheel was stuck. He then aborted the takeoff, but the plane skidded off the runway. It went through the perimeter fence, crossed a highway and crashed into a building. About 15 people were injured, one critically, but nobody was killed, officials said. The injured included two people in cars along the highway. Preliminary investigation results indicate that the airplane's center of gravity (CG) was well forward of the allowable limit.  On December 16, 2003 another Challenger jet aborted takeoff at Teterboro when the flightcrew was unable to rotate the airplane. The aircraft overran the runway. In this case, the NTSB determined that the plane was above the maximum gross takeoff weight, and outside the forward center-of-gravity envelope. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of the accident was the flight crewÂs failure to ensure the airplane was loaded within weight and balance limits and their attempt to take off with the center of gravity well forward of the forward takeoff limit, which prevented the airplane from rotating at the intended rotation speed. Contributing to the accident were: 1) PJMÂs conduct of charter flights (using PJM pilots and airplanes) without proper FAA certification and its failure to ensure that all for-hire flights were conducted in accordance with 14  CFR Part 135 requirements; 2) Darby AviationÂs failure to maintain operational control over 14 CFR Part 135 flights being conducted under its certificate by PJM, which resulted in an environment conducive to the development of systemic patterns of flight crew performance deficiencies like those observed in this accident; 3) the failure of the Birmingham, Alabama, FAA Flight Standards District Office to provide adequate surveillance and oversight of operations conducted under DarbyÂs Part 135 certificate; and 4) the FAAÂs tacit approval of arrangements such as that between Darby and PJM.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NTSB/AAR-06/04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ   AP  NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Teterboro Airport, NJ (TEB); February 2005; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Teterboro Airport, NJ (TEB); February 2005; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Teterboro Airport, NJ (TEB); February 2005; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All 105 on board were killed. The Boeing 737-242 aircraft, with Kyrgyz Republic registration EX-037, departed from Herat at 10:02 UTC. The estimated time of arrival (ETA) at Kabul International Airport was 10:55 UTC. The aircraft was cruising at flight level 270 when it contacted Bagram Radar Approach Control (""Bagram"") for descent and landing. The flight was normal until it failed to level at flight level 130 during the VOR/DME approach. At 10:43 UTC, Bagram cleared the flight to descend at its discretion and to expect the VOR approach to runway 29. The prevailing weather was also passed on to the aircraft. Visibility was reported 2 kilometers with snow, ceiling 2200 feet broken. wind calm and altimeter setting QNH 1016. When the aircraft was 35 miles west of the Kabul VOR, radar contact was established with Bagram. The aircraft was advised by Bagram to cross the VOR at or above flight level 130 and cleared it for the VOR/DME approach to runway 29 at Kabul Airport. At 10:48 UTC the aircraft reported flight level 130. Bagram again cleared the aircraft for the VOR approach to runway 29 and advised the aircraft to report procedure turn inbound. The crew replied that they would report proceeding inbound for the VOR approach to runway 29. This was the last transmission from the aircraft. Search for the aircraft was delayed and hampered due to a severe snowstorm in the region. The aircraft was located approximately three days later by an International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) helicopter The Flight Data Recorder (FDR) was recovered, but the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) could not be found. No data was found recorded on the FDR. Probable Cause: ""The accident occurred probably due to the premature descent by the Aircraft below its minimum assigned altitude of 13,000 feet during approach in weather conditions below VFR requirements.

The airplane was about 7 minutes from landing, and the flight attendant was completing his before landing checklist when turbulence was encountered.  After regaining consciousness a few seconds later, he was able to get to an empty passenger seat.  A deadheading flight attendant assumed the incapacitated flight attendant's duties.  Review and analysis of available weather data and forecast products showed that airman's meteorological information (AIRMET) Update 6 was issued by the National Weather Service (NWS) and in effect for the flight for occasional moderate turbulence below 12,000 feet.  A review of the meteorological data showed that the airplane was operating in conditions that would have supported at least moderate turbulence below 10,000 feet msl.  The weather packet included in the flight release provided to the flight crew by the airline's dispatch prior to the flight contained information for AIRMET Update 3; however, AIRMET Update 6 (valid for the accident flight) was not listed.  Information contained on the release indicated to the crew that no moderate or greater turbulence was present along the route of flight.  At the time of the accident, the airline's contract weather provider evaluated current meteorological data and staff meteorologists used their judgment of the weather to issue a SIGMEC (significant meteorological conditions, a company issued advisory) based on the current weather conditions.  NWS-issued SIGMET Yankee was canceled at 1630 because the current pilot reports (PIREPS) indicated that previously forecasted turbulent conditions had diminished.  Although an AIRMET was in effect at the time of the accident for moderate or greater turbulence, there were no other supporting indicators to the airline staff meteorologist that moderate or greater turbulence was present along the route of flight.  Due to the cancellation of the SIGMET and the lack of additional supporting information for moderate or greater turbulence, the meteorologist did not issue a SIGMEC.  Therefore, the turbulence information was not on the flight release provided to the flight crew. Probable Cause: the in-flight encounter with turbulence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: LAX05LA105 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB LAX05LA105 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  10 January 2001 N394AE American Eagle Airlines 0 San Antonio, TX non Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates25-Mar-2024 09:36 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

Approximately nine minutes before the landing, the co-pilot activated the aircraft radio control of aerodrome lighting (ARCAL) and contacted the approach UNICOM at Bromont. The Bromont Airport dispatcher informed the crew that only the PAPI was operational. A NOTAM had been issued on 17 February 2005, indicating that the runway edge lights would be out of order until 22:00 UTC, 22 February 2005. The PAPI and the approach lights lit up when the co-pilot activated the ARCAL, because their switches had been left on. At approximately 1000 feet (300 m) asl and five miles (8 km) from the threshold, the flight crew had the approach lights and the PAPI in sight. It was not evident whether the PAPI was positioned on the right or the left side of the runway. The airport chart published by Jeppesen indicated ""PAPI L"" (left). In response to a query from the crew, the Bromont dispatcher indicated that the PAPI was on the right side of the runway. From his location facing the aircraft, the PAPI was to the dispatcher's right. The approach was continued visually, keeping to the left of the PAPI. At approximately two miles (3,2 km) from the runway threshold, the co-pilot noticed that the approach lights were at his right. He reported his observation to the captain, who paid little attention to it. Less than two seconds before the crash, the co-pilot asked the captain whether he had the runway in sight. The captain did not reply and continued the descent until the aircraft touched down 300 feet (90 m) to the left of runway 05L, 1800 feet (550 m) beyond the threshold. When the captain realized that he was not on the runway, he applied full power to execute a missed approach; however, the aircraft hit a ditch approximately four feet (1,20 m) deep that was perpendicular to the flight path. The nose wheel and right landing gear collapsed. The aircraft came to a stop facing back the way it had come, after travelling a distance of 1800 feet during which it made a full turn followed by a 180-degree turn. FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1. The flight crew attempted a night landing in the absence of runway edge lights. The aircraft touched down 300 feet to the left of Runway 05L and 1800 feet beyond the threshold. 2. The runway was not closed for night use despite the absence of runway edge lights. Nothing required it to be closed. 3. Poor flight planning, non-compliance with regulations and standard operating procedures (SOPs), and the lack of communications between the two pilots reveal a lack of airmanship on the part of the crew, which contributed to the accident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A05Q0024 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: TSB Report Number A05Q0024   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

As the captain continued to rotate the airplane, the tail section struck the ground, and the ""tail strike"" EICAS (Engine Indication and Crew Alerting System) message illuminated. The flight crew then completed the takeoff sequence, completed all checklists, jettisoned fuel, and returned to the airport where an uneventful landing was made. The winds recorded at the airport, about 1 minute after the accident, were from 280 degrees, at 21 knots, gusting to 28 knots. Review of the DFDR data revealed that at the time the takeoff roll began, the captain's control wheel was turned 25.5 degrees to the left, resulting in the upward deflection of the left wing outboard aileron, flaperon, and 6 of 7 spoilers, which was consistent with a correction for crosswind conditions. As the takeoff roll continued, the control wheel input varied between 19.6 degrees and 37.5 degrees to the left, and at the approximate point of rotation, the control wheel was turned to the left 38.4 degrees. The control column position also began to move aft at the point of rotation, with a force of 22.7 pounds, and the pitch of the airplane rose to 3 degrees nose up. As the pilot continued the rotation, he held the pitch control at a value consistent with previous recorded flights, before pulling the control column further aft, increasing the pitch angle to the tail strike attitude of approximately 13 degrees nose up. One second later, as both left and right main gear indicated no weight on wheels, the control column position reached its maximum value during the event, 9.2 degrees aft, and the pitch reached 17.8 degrees nose up. A Safety Board vehicle performance study compared the airspeed and groundspeed recorded during the accident, and determined that a wind gust caused an approximate 7 knot loss in airspeed, the lateral control wheel input during the rotation ranged from 24 to 37 degrees, and the maximum pitch rate during the rotation was approximately 6.0 degrees/second. Using these data in a Boeing estimation method, it was determined that three factors contributed to the reduced tail clearance during the takeoff. These factors were the loss of airspeed that resulted from a tailwind gust during the rotation, the loss of lift that resulted from the deflection of the lateral control surfaces, and a pitch rate in excess of that recommended. These factors combined for a total reduction in tail clearance of approximately 150-170 percent. It was concluded in the performance study that reducing the pitch rate to the Boeing recommended 2.5 degrees/second would have brought the tail clearance reduction to the 80 percent to 100 percent of nominal level, and from that point, a 1-knot increase in rotation speed would have provided about a 7 percent increase to the tail clearance margin. According to Boeing, the typical liftoff attitude was 8.5 degrees, the minimum tail clearance was 37 inches, and the tail strike pitch attitude was 12.1 degrees up. The operator's flight manual warned pilots to ""Avoid any tendency to rapidly rotate to a 10 degree pitch attitude and hold it until lift-off. This technique invites a tail strike."" In addition, neither Boeing, nor the operator, had procedures or policies for adding an increase in rotation speed to compensate for crosswind or tailwind conditions. Probable Cause: The captain's failure to follow company procedures, which resulted in a tail strike. Contributing were the gusty crosswind and tailwind conditions, and the manufacturer's failure to provide adequate performance planning data to account for gusty crosswinds during takeoff.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NYC05FA054 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 12 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB NYC05FA054 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates10-Oct-2022 16:47 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

After confirming no danger to their airplane, they discovered that one of the flight attendants had injured her elbow.  The captain returned the airplane to the gate, and the flight attendant was replaced.  Two additional flight attendants reported ""some bruising"" but felt able to continue the flight.  En route, one of the two flight attendants advised the captain of back pain, and the other felt sick to her stomach.   After landing, the two flight attendants were taken to a hospital for further evaluation.  One of the two flight attendants was released, but the other remained in the hospital in excess of 48 hours with a herniated disk.   According to the first officer, the reason he told the captain to stop was because another airplane was on the crossing runway.  The first officer thought it could be holding number one for takeoff, and wanted to ensure that his airplane was on the correct taxiway before crossing the runway.  Probable Cause: The first officer's misjudgment of a perceived threat, which resulted in the captain's excessive braking and subsequent injury to a flight attendant.

The two pilots and two passengers were not injured. Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight that departed Columbus-Port Columbus International Airport, Ohio. Prior to the day of the incident, the pilot and copilot had not flown together. In addition, the copilot spoke broken English. The copilot obtained the current ATIS information about 150 miles from the destination airport. Although the ATIS information reported thin slush on all surfaces, the captain had not asked about runway conditions, and the copilot did not relay the information regarding runway conditions.  The flightcrew continued the approach in moderate to severe turbulence, and performed pre-landing checks. Due to the turbulence, the flightcrew missed several radio transmissions, including the aircraft ahead them that reported a go-around, and later reported good braking action. The incident airplane turned onto final approach for runway 01; a 7,000-foot-long, 150-foot-wide, asphalt runway. During the final approach, the landing gear was down and flaps were in the 25-degree extended position. Air Traffic Control (ATC) relayed the good braking action report to the incident flightcrew, based upon the previous arrival aircraft. However, the previous arrival aircraft was equipped with thrust reversers, and the incident airplane was not. ATC also provided two wind checks to the incident airplane while on final approach. The wind checks were reported as 340 degrees at 15 knots, and 340 degrees at 20 knots, respectively. The pilot reported that due to the wind, he flew the final approach without full flaps, at Vref plus 20 (139 knots), and slowed to 134 knots over the runway threshold.  After touchdown the airplane failed to stop on the runway and overran.  The airplane came to rest approximately 230 feet beyond the departure end of runway 1. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The pilot in command's inadequate in-flight planning, which resulted in an overrun landing on a contaminated runway. Factors were inadequate crew coordination, gusty winds, and a slush covered runway.

During climbout through Flight Level 20 (20,000 feet), the No. 1 Hydraulic Low Pressure caution light illuminated.  The flight crew ran the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) checklist for the caution message.  The procedures outlined in the QRH instructed the flight crew to: ""Land at the nearest suitable airport.""  The captain informed the airline's maintenance control about the caution message, but he did not inform flight dispatch about the caution message or the need to land at the nearest suitable airport.

The captain reported that the landing was normal until the airplane started to veer off the left side of the runway.  The post accident inspection of the airplane revealed no preexisting anomalies, other than the loss of the No. 1 Hydraulic system which resulted in the loss of ground spoilers.  The NTSB Aircraft Performance Study indicated that the airplane approached runway 1L crossing the threshold at about 2302:16 at a recorded radio altitude of about 50 feet above ground level, with an indicated airspeed of 139 knots (about 136 knots ground speed) and a pitch angle of about 4 degrees nose down.

The airplane's ground track then began to turn left and departed off the side of the runway (veered off the runway) at about 2302:37 and approximately 4,200 feet beyond the threshold. The longitudinal acceleration from point of touchdown to when it veered off the runway was recorded between -0.12 and -0.15 G's.  An investigation of airport operations revealed that airport operations did not inspect Runway 1L/19R after a pilot report (PIREP) of NIL braking action by a Beech Jet at 2018.  Airport operations did not conduct or provide friction measurement reports and (Notices to Airmen) NOTAMS for Runway 1L/19R between March 10 at 1925 and the time of the accident on March 11 at 2302, when airport conditions were changing with significant snowfall accumulations.  The airport did not conduct a runway inspection or friction report of Runway 1L/19R after the airplane veered off the runway. Probable Cause: the captain's failure to adequately compensate for the crosswind conditions, and his failure to maintain directional control during landing.  Contributing factors include the captain's failure to land at the nearest suitable airport after an in-flight mechanical problem, the airport operation's failure to conduct runway friction tests and to issue NOTAMS in accordance with existing regulations, the crosswind, the snow-covered runway, the runway sign, and night conditions.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CHI05FA077 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB CHI05FA077 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  11 March 2005 N8932C Northwest Airlink, lsf Pinnacle Airlines 0 Milwaukee-General Mitchell International Airport, WI (MKE) sub Runway excursion Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates25-Mar-2024 09:35 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

CONCLUSIONS: ""The Aviation Accident Investigation Commission of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, determines on the probable cause(s) of the accident, as follows: The impact of the aircraft against the ground without loss of control due to the deficient dispatch, planning, execution of the Checklists and CRM of the crew allowing the takeoff and rotation run to start with overweight (25,798kgs) and 0Â° of flap since for a weight of 25,000kgs corresponded 15 Â° of flaps according to the Flight Manual of the aircraft. Likewise, the failure to abort the takeoff when the configuration alarm did not function. CONTRIBUTING CAUSES: - The overweight of the aircraft, which was due to the deficient procedure used by the same crew member who performed the functions of dispatcher and navigator in Lima, by not complying with the provisions of the ATSA company's MGO. - The Checklists that do not conform to the order indicated in the Flight Manual (Annex 3) of the aircraft.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIAA Report number: CIAA-ACCID-004-2005 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  29 September 2021 UR-UZE Constanta Airline 0 Aden Adde International Airport (MGQ/HCMM) min Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot allocated to the flight had not flown for 32 days; he was therefore required to complete a short flight at Glasgow to regain currency before landing to collect a paramedic for the flight to Campbeltown Airport. Poor weather at Campbeltown Airport necessitated an instrument approach. There was neither radar nor Air Traffic Control Service at the airport, so the pilot was receiving a Flight Information Service from a Flight Information Service Officer in accordance with authorised procedures. After arriving overhead Campbeltown Airport, the aircraft flew outbound on the approach procedure for runway 11 and began a descent. The pilot next transmitted that he had completed the Âbase turnÂ, indicating that he was inbound to the airport and commencing an approach. The airplane had gradually descended below the minimum altitude With a slight left wing low attitude, the airplane contacted the sea. It broke up after impact and sank. CAUSAL FACTORS:  ""1. The pilot allowed the aircraft to descend below the minimum altitude for the aircraftÂs position on the approach procedure, and this descent probably continued unchecked until the aircraft flew into the sea. 2. A combination of fatigue, workload and lack of recent flying practise probably contributed to the pilotÂs reduced performance. 3.

On the last leg of the flight, the pilots attempted a VFR approach, which was not permitted for this airport. The aircraft descended, below the glide slope as the crew mistook the motorway for the runway. They entered a sideslip for more than 20 seconds when the pilot tried to align with the 'runway' causing the aircraft to lose speed. A stall developed at a height of 26 metres and the left wing struck a sand heap 4217 metres before the runway threshold causing the aircraft to crash 30 metres further on. The Commission found that the cause of the crash was the collision of the aircraft with the ground at the final stage of the approach due to its exit to the overcritical angles of attack and the stalling regime (an off-flight flight regime) at low altitude. The deceleration of the aircraft to the stall speed was due to its withdrawal, as a result of the control actions of the commander of the aircraft, to the flight mode with slip and maintaining this mode for a long time (more than 20 seconds) with insufficient engine operation and lack of control by the crew of the airspeed. Possible errors in the indications of a number of instruments (speed indicators, angle of attack indicator) could make it difficult for crew members to control flight parameters.Sources: Aviatsiya.ru  Gazeta.ru  Michael Roch  Russian Ministry of Transport  RIA Novosti  ITAR-TASS   Location  Images: photo (c) Reynold Camilleri; Yakutsk Airport (YKS); 12 August 2003 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

A helicopter was called in the extinguish the fire. Since the fire spread rapidly, a second helicopter was ordered, but there were no helicopters available. The Department of Civil Protection was contacted to send a fire fighting airplane.  A Canadair CL-415 departed Roma-Ciampino Airport (CIA) at 16:28 on a fire fighting mission. It arrived at the scene of the fire at 17:20. After a survey of the scene the crew commenced their mission. At 18:04, immediately after releasing the water, the airplane contacted the cable guard of a power line. The right hand float separated from the wing and a fire erupted on the severed wing. The pilots lost control and the airplane came down in a residential area, crashing into an unoccupied house. PROBABLE CAUSES AND CAUSAL FACTORS (translated from Italian) The accident was triggered by the collision of the aircraft against the cable guard of a power line during a fire fighting mission. The collision was caused by an inadequate trajectory towards the front of the fire. The damage suffered as a result of the impact against the power line  seriously compromised the controllability of the aircraft, affecting a positive outcome of the emergency. The following causal factors may have contributed to the dynamics of the accident: - Poor decision making in attacking the fire, causing the crew to focus their attention on obstacles (pylons) of Power Line No 500, without considering the presence of the cable guard line n.550; - The reduced visibility of obstacles resulting from the smoke of the forest; - The inadequate reporting of electricity pylons and associated overhead lines; - Non-activation of the required radio links, so the crew could not receive reports on the presence of obstacles; - Short and discontinuous experience of the captain in that role, coming from the institution of the ""PIC Frozen""; - The combination of to similar qualified pilots (""PIC Frozen"") in the cockpit for the operation of a flight, one just rehabilitated to a high command function, the other still employed in the role of co-pilot: This condition could have a negative impact in terms of crew integration, obscuring decision making; - The existence of criticality in corporate manuals used at the date of the accident; - Reduced operational capacity of the crew in the last phase of flight, resulting from the strong heat of the fire under the left wing which penetrated the airplane through an opening created by the separation of a porthole.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ANSV Report number: - Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; January 2002 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The landing gear was reportedly slow to extend, however a 3-green gear down indication was eventually displayed. When the flaps were selected to 100% prior to landing, the gear unsafe aural warning sounded and the crew executed a missed approach. On the overshoot the gear was selected up, the 3 green indication remained and the landing gear unsafe light was illuminated. The crew chose to divert to Winnipeg where maintenance was available. While en route back to Winnipeg, the crew accomplished the relevant abnormal checklist (Landing with Landing Gear Unsafe), and declared an emergency. At no time did the 3 green indication extinguish. On arrival in Winnipeg after gear extension, the crew requested a fly-by, where ground personnel advised that the gear appeared to be down. The landing was accomplished successfully, however the aircraft was stopped on runway 36, in order to accomplish a visual inspection.

The aircraft operated on a round trip from Havana to Caracas and back. The first officer was pilot flying for the return leg. The initial part of the takeoff was performed by the captain. After reaching a speed of 150 km/h the captain handed over the flight controls to the first officer. After passing through 220-230 km/h, the pilot noticed that he had no control of the elevator and immediately reported the failure to the captain, who again took the controls to verify the anomaly. During this check, approximately 11 seconds passed and the airplane's speed reached 282 km/h, while covering some 693 meters. The aircraft now had covered a total runway distance of 2230 meters, leaving 815 meters of runway remaining for braking. The takeoff was aborted but the aircraft was not able to stop on the remaining runway. The landing gear separated after running over a channel located approximately 20 meters after the runway. The aircraft came to a stop on a downslope. CAUSES:  Human Factor, Material Factor and Physical Factor and taking into account the characteristics of the Accident and the evidence gathered during the course of the investigation, considers the Human Factor as the causal factor of this accident due to the following: - The flight crew did not perform the respective manual check of the flight controls (elevators). - The flight crew did not perform the visual check on the panel of the locked/red and unlocked/green warning lights of the flight control surfaces (ailerons, elevators, directional rudder). - There was no adequate Cockpit Management, or assertive behavior by the crew, in terms of decision making during the takeoff abort. - There were no accurate calculations for takeoff speed references (V1-Vr-V2) in analogy to takeoff weights. - The evacuation of the passengers was not efficient and correct, since it was evidenced that the exit of the passengers was carried out through the least convenient doors, due to the position of the aircraft, which had to be blocked by the cabin crew. - There was no deployment of the slides for evacuation, which resulted in some passengers suffering dislocated limbs when they had to jump.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JIAAC Venezuela Report number: 017/2005 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: Agencia Cubana de Noticias   Location  Images: photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Havana-JosÃ© MartÃ­ International Airport (HAV/MUHA); January 2004 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

During takeoff from Mukalla's runway 06, at the speed 225 km/h, the nose landing gear retracted. The captain decided to abort the takeoff. He steered the plane to the left to avoid a collision with a radio-technical equipment car. The aircraft failed to stop on the runway and ran onto rugged sand terrain, 2 m below the runway level. The aircraft hit a hill and tilted to the right as it came to rest 400m from the runway end and 30m left from extended runway center line. Conclusions: The reason of this occurrence is early retraction of landing gears without order of the Captain before aircraft airborne.

The planes were flying 300 feet above the mountainous terrain when 87-0127 was approaching a ridge. The airplane was not able to clear the ridge and stalled as the crew attempted to climb away. The accident investigation board determined that the crew's loss of situational awareness placed the aircraft in too low a climb with respect to the surrounding mountainous terrain. Responding to the situation, the crew did not use all available power and stalled the aircraft during a turning climb. This resulted in a loss of aircraft control and almost immediate crash.Sources: AP  U.S. EUCOM, AFPN   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

The airplane was vectored onto the final approach course for the ILS 19 approach at Teterboro, New Jersey, and the captain configured the airplane to land.  He flew the approach at Vref plus 30 knots because of turbulence and reported wind gusts.  As he initiated a flare to land on runway 19, the airplane encountered windshear.  It touched down hard on the main landing gear, bounced, and then touched down again on the nose wheel.  The captain stabilized the airplane, slowed to taxi speed, and exited the runway.  Examination of the airplane revealed substantial damage to the pressure bulkhead in the vicinity of the nose gear box.

At 09:50 the crew contacted the Coca controller, reported 20 miles out at FL60, requesting a visual approach to runway 15. The controller cleared them for the approach, reported wind calm, pressure 29.94 in. Hg, a temperature of 26 degrees and requested the crew to report on finals. At 09:54:29 the crew reported on finals and were cleared to land. The F-28 touched down 4,5 meters short of runway 15 and struck the raised lip of the runway threshold. It continued for 112 m before veering to the left off the runway. The airplane ran another 263 m before it skidded to a stop against the wall of a company building. Runway 15 is a 2000 m long asphalt runway. Investigation revealed that the pilots thought the Coca runway was short. To be able to stop the plane on the runway without excessive use of the brakes, they decided to touch down as close to the threshold as possible. The correct procedure would be to pass over the threshold at 50 feet (15 m). The AFM showed a landing distance of 930 m needed at maximum landing weight considering 42Â° of flaps, speed brakes out, lift dumpers armed, antiskid operative.

At 25 miles from Lima the crew there was a low fuel pressure warning. Approximately 22 miles from Lima the left engine was shut down. Within 3 miles of Lima the right engine lost power, and was also shut down. The crew declared an emergency. The pilot perform a 180 degrees turn due to the presence of gas tanks nearby. They turned to an agricultural field where an emergency landing was performed. On touchdown the airplane swung, sustaining substantial damage. Causes and contributing factors (translated from original Spanish report): 1. Operation with four consecutive flights made by the same crew to Chagual aerodrome (an aerodrome that demands a high alertness and situational awareness due to difficult topographical conditions), a long and exhausting day flying and working together with the multiple functions performed by the technical crew (dispatcher, payer, loader, cabin crew) probably decreased the performance and capacity of the technical crew and safety. 2.

He approached the airport from the northeast overflew the airport, and made a left turn to enter the downwind leg for runway 23. He saw some parachutes on the ground and some in the air. He saw a tandem jumper toward the southwest and believed he had accounted for all jumpers.  As he turned left, he saw a flash of colors, felt an impact and drag from the left wing. He got the airplane on the ground as soon as possible. Radar data indicated that the airplane was about 1,300 feet msl when it was approaching runway 5/23 from the northeast. The airplane flew over runway 23, near mid field, about 1,100 feet msl and was between 900 to 800 feet msl during the left bank entering the downwind for runway 23; last capture was at 300 feet as it approached runway 23. One jumper stated the parachute landing zone was located on the airport adjacent to the left side of runway 30. The video equipment that was carried by the cinematographer captured the collision. The cinematographer jumps with the last tandem jumpers. The tandem chute deploys at 3 minutes and 7 seconds into the video, 13 seconds later the cinematographer's chute deploys. During his descent, he removes the helmet-mounted camera and looks into the view making a few remarks about the jump. He places the camera back to its original position and continues to capture; the sky is overcast and visibility is good. The view pans to the right and captures three skydivers with chutes deployed at an altitude above him. At approximately 4 minutes and 54 seconds into the video, a sound similar to an airplane engine can be heard at an increasing level for 5 seconds. At 4 minutes and 59 seconds, the view pans slightly left and a sound similar to an impact is heard. The view becomes blurry and pans rapidly. At 5 minutes and 2 seconds, three frames capture what appears to be an aircraft in close proximity banking away and to the right of the camera's view. The view continues to pan rapidly for about 6 seconds showing shots of the ground, sky, and parachute. The camera stabilizes and records until impact with the ground at 5 minutes and 46 seconds. One of the master tandem jumpers on that jump stated that the pilot did not give a briefing on which runway or approach he was going to use. The norm is for the jumpers to avoid crossing runways below 1,000 feet and to stay away about 300 feet from the runways, and the pilot to avoid jumpers at all time. Due to the amount of jumps that are performed per day there is no briefing before each flight. Approaches and runway selection depends on the individual pilot. A representative of the operator stated that only verbal guidance is given to the pilots to follow the FAA rules and it up to their discretion for approaches and runway selection. The acting airport manager stated that there is no agreement for airport operations between the skydive operator and the city, only the lease agreement. The city did develop a voluntary noise abatement procedure outlining areas to avoid. The several pilots at the airport stated that for several years they communicated with the city regarding safety concerns with approaches and runway selection by the skydive operator. They stated the city did not correct the situation.

Because of delays in the payment of wages, planned crew members refused to fly. The airplane departed with a captain and copilot. On April 25 they left Verkhnyaya Khava and flew to an area 4 km north of the city for another crop spraying mission. The captain did not judge the wind direction adequately, so the airplane attempted to takeoff from the area with a tailwind component. Direction could not be maintained due to the wind. The pilot did not use the brakes to maintain directional control. The airplane did not achieve the speed necessary to lift off (99 km/h). The pilot pulled on the controls, but could not lift the An-2 off the ground. It ran onto a freshly ploughed field and overturned. A fire erupted in the engine but this was quickly contained by the crew with the aid of an onboard fire extinguisher. PROBABLE CAUSE: The attempt of the captain to carry out a takeoff with a tailwind, which led to the loss of directional on takeoff and the rolling of aircraft beyond the limits of the takeoff area, and incompetent actions on the continuation of takeoff.Sources: Dmitriy Yertsov  Ministry of Emergency Situations (MChS) of Russia  Scramble 313  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

On board the aircraft, a DHC-8-103 with registration LN-WIK, were a crew of two pilots and one cabin attendant, 26 passengers and one passive cabin attendant.  During the approach to Hammerfest the crew was informed about variable and occasional gusty wind from south-east. The wind direction favoured runway 23 and the crew planned the landing accordingly. The copilot was Pilot Flying (PF) and the commander was Pilot Not Flying (PNF). The copilot was newly hired and was flying under supervision. The crew was kept updated on the wind conditions by the AFIS operator, and at times the gusty wind conditions favoured runway 05. The copilot left the control to the commander who continued the approach to runway 05. Just before landing the wind direction veered to the right and increased in strength, resulting in a significant tail wind component. This resulted in a marked increase in the descent rate which the commander tried to stop by advancing to full power. However, the altitude was too low and the airplane touched down hard just inside the runway edge on runway 05. At touch down the right main landing gear leg failed. The airplane slid on the belly, right partly retracted main wheel and wing tip for some 650 m, and stopped just after the second (TWY B) turnoff to the apron. The fire and rescue vehicles were quickly at the scene and sprayed foam on the plane to prevent fire. The cabin attendant calmed the passengers who wanted to get out of the plane quickly due to smoke and burned smell in the cabin. It took 33 seconds from the commander's order to evacuate until this was actually initiated. The delay was mainly caused by the fact that the order did not get through the cabinÂs Public Address (PA) system. The investigations show that WiderÃ¸e permitted landings in up to the maximum demonstrated cross wind component of 36 kt and in up to 10 kt tail wind during short field operations.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIBN Report number: AIBN SL 2009/22 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 years and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Aftenposten  WiderÃ¸e   Location  Images: photo (c) AIBN; Hammerfest Airport (HFT); 01 May 2005; (publicdomain) photo (c) AIBN; Hammerfest Airport (HFT); 01 May 2005; (publicdomain) photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Oslo-Gardermoen Airport (OSL/ENGM); 08 August 2004 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The payload comprised 1790 kilograms (kg) of courier packs and parcel mail. Loading of the freight was delayed, being completed at about 21:15. The crew ordered 570 litres (about 1000 pounds or 450 kg) of additional fuel and instructed the refueller to put it all into the left wing tank, rather than put half of the ordered amount into each tank, as was company practice. Refuelling was completed at 21:30. Two minutes later the flight taxied out to runway 23R. Takeoff was performed at 21:36. The aircraft climbed to an altitude of FL220 with the autopilot engaged for the climb and cruise. At cruise altitude the climb power remained set for about 15 minutes in order to make up some of the delay caused by the late departure. At about 22:12:28, after power was reduced to a cruise setting and the cruise checks had been completed, the captain noted some fuel imbalance and decided to carry out further fuel balancing. He said, ""WeÂll just open the crossflow again ..sit on left ball and trim it accordingly"". The captain repeated the instruction 5 times in a period of 19 seconds, by telling the first officer to, ""Step on the left pedal, and just trim it to take the pressure off"" and ""Get the ball out to the right as far as you can ..and just trim it"". The first officer sought confirmation of the procedure and said, ""I was being a bit cautious"" to which the captain replied, ""DonÂt be cautious mate, itÂll do it good"". These instructions resulted in the aircraft being flown at a large sideslip angle by the use of the rudder trim control while the autopilot was engaged. Forty-seven seconds after opening the crossflow, the captain said, ""DoesnÂt like that one mate.. youÂd better grab it."" Within one second there was the aural alert ""Bank angle"", followed by a chime tone, probably the selected altitude deviation warning. Both pilots exclaimed surprise. The autopilot had probably disengaged automatically because a servo reached its torque limit, allowing the aircraft to roll and dive abruptly as a result of the applied rudder trim. The crew was unable to recover control from the ensuing spiral dive before airspeed and g limits were grossly exceeded, resulting in the structural failure and in-flight break-up of the aircraft. The flying conditions of a dark night with cloud cover below probably made it more difficult to notice the developing upset at an early stage. The break-up probably started when the aircraft was quite high, perhaps FL199. The wreckage was scattered over a large area of at least two to three square km of rural farmland.

The flight was operated by Transair but conducted on behalf of Aero-Tropics Air Services. Aero-Tropics would provide ground handling, pilot briefing facilities and marketing services. Transair provided the airplane and crew. The Metro 23 aircraft departed Cairns at 08:31. During the descent to Lockhart River on the northbound flight, the crew intended to perform a runway 30 RNAV (GNSS) approach. Late in the approach, the crew appropriately manoeuvred the aircraft to land on runway 12. The engines were shutdown at 09:50. The aircraft departed Lockhart River at 09:58 and arrived at Bamaga at 10:39. The aircraft was refuelled at Bamaga for the return flight to Cairns via Lockhart River to collect two passengers. The pilot in command commented to the ground agent prior to departing Bamaga that the weather was 'bad' at Lockhart River and it may not be possible to land there. The forecast conditions at the aerodrome included a broken10 cloud base 1,000 ft above the aerodrome for periods of up to 60 minutes. The aircraft departed Bamaga at 11:07 and climbed to the cruising altitude of FL170. Descent was commenced at 11:32. Three minutes later the copilot advised Brisbane ATC that the aircraft was on descent, passing 10,000 ft AMSL with an estimated time of arrival at Lockhart River of 11:38. At 11:39 the copilot broadcast on the CTAF (Common Traffic Advisory Frequency) that the crew was conducting the runway 12 RNAV (GNSS) approach, and that the aircraft was at the 'Whisky Golf' (LHRWG) waypoint and tracking for the 'Whisky India' (LHRWI) waypoint. At 11:41 the airplane was over the LHRWI intermediate fix and descent was recommenced at 4.8 NM from the LHRWF waypoint. This was 3.1 NM before the descent point specified on the approach chart for the 3.49 degree constant angle approach path to the missed approach point. After levelling briefly at 3000 feet 18 degrees of flaps were selected. The aircraft then commenced descent 1.4 NM before the final approach fix (FAF). This was 0.3 NM (approximately 7 seconds) after the descent point specified for the constant angle approach path. The average rate of descent was 1000 ft/min, increasing to 1700 ft/min. At 11:43 the Metro was over the FAF at an altitude of 2379 feet. The altitude at this stage should have been 2860 feet. The flight descended then through the segment minimum safe altitude of 2,060 ft. It continued to descend until it flew into the side of a heavily timbered ridge in the Iron Range National Park. The height of the initial impact with trees was 1,210 ft, which was about 90 ft below the crest of the ridge. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS RELATING TO OCCURRENCE EVENTS AND INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS - The crew commenced the Lockhart River Runway 12 RNAV (GNSS) approach, even though the crew were aware that the copilot did not have the appropriate endorsement and had limited experience to conduct this type of instrument approach. - The descent speeds, approach speeds and rate of descent were greater than those specified for the aircraft in the Transair Operations Manual. The speeds and rate of descent also exceeded those appropriate for establishing a stabilised approach. - During the approach, the aircraft descended below the segment minimum safe altitude for the aircraft's position on the approach. - The aircraft's high rate of descent, and the descent below the segment minimum safe altitude, were not detected and/or corrected by the crew before the aircraft collided with terrain. - The accident was almost certainly the result of controlled flight into terrain. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS RELATING TO LOCAL CONDITIONS - The crew probably experienced a very high workload during the approach. - The crew probably lost situational awareness about the aircraft's position along the approach. - The pilot in command had a previous history of conducting RNAV (GNSS) approaches with crew without appropriate endorsements, and operating the aircraft at speeds higher than those specified in the Transair Operations Manual. - The Lockhart River Runway 12 RNAV (GNSS) approach probably created higher pilot workload and reduced position situational awareness for the crew compared with most other instrument approaches. This was due to the lack of distance referencing to the missed approach point throughout the approach, and the longer than optimum final approach segment with three altitude limiting steps. - The copilot had no formal training and limited experience to act effectively as a crew member during a Lockhart River Runway 12 RNAV (GNSS) approach. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS RELATING TO TRANSAIR PROCESSES - Transair's flight crew training program had significant limitations, such as superficial or incomplete ground-based instruction during endorsement training, no formal training for new pilots in the operational use of GPS, no structured training on minimising the risk of controlled flight into terrain, and no structured training in crew resource management and operating effectively in a multi-crew environment. (Safety Issue) - Transair's processes for supervising the standard of flight operations at the Cairns base had significant limitations, such as not using an independent approved check pilot to review operations, reliance on passive measures to detect problems, and no defined processes for selecting and monitoring the performance of the base manager. (Safety Issue) - Transair's standard operating procedures for conducting instrument approaches had significant limitations, such as not providing clear guidance on approach speeds, not providing guidance for when to select aircraft configuration changes during an approach, no clear criteria for a stabilised approach, and no standardised phraseology for challenging safety-critical decisions and actions by other crew members. (Safety Issue) - Transair had not installed a terrain awareness and warning system, such as an enhanced ground proximity warning system, in VH-TFU. - Transair's organisational structure, and the limited responsibilities given to non-management personnel, resulted in high work demands on the chief pilot. It also resulted in a lack of independent evaluation of training and checking, and created disincentives and restricted opportunities within Transair to report safety concerns with management decision making. (Safety Issue) - Transair did not have a structured process for proactively managing safetyrelated risks associated with its flight operations. (Safety Issue) - Transair's chief pilot did not demonstrate a high level of commitment to safety.

The flight was carried out by DC-9-51 N763NC. After takeoff, at some point below 4,000 feet altitude, when the slats were retracted, the MASTER CAUTION light illuminated. The co-pilot, who was pilot flying, observed the RUDDER CONTROL MANUAL annunciator light and then saw that the right hydraulic system pressure was about 1,000 pounds per square inch (PSI). The right engine hydraulic pump switch was selected to 'off' and the flight was continued while the captain referred to the NWA DC-9 Cockpit Operating Manual (COM) to complete the procedures. He also discussed the problem with maintenance control on the ground. The approach and landing at Minneapolis were briefed thoroughly. Approximately 18:50, the captain contacted dispatch to request that they ""call out the trucks"" for their arrival. At 19:01 the captain radioed to MSP center ""ah we got a hydraulic problem, we're gonna go ahead and declare an emergency. ah everything should be okay but just gonna have to land a little faster and we're gonna have the trucks standing and everything."" The landing gear was extended early in the approach because the crew was uncertain if they would have to use the Emergency Gear Extension Handle. This was not necessary as the gear extended successfully. The first officer flew a long slow downwind from Farmington to a downwind leg to runway 22. He turned onto the localizer course at an altitude about 3,000 feet. The flight was then cleared for the approach to runway 22. A safe landing was carried out at 19:23. After landing the flaps were retracted and the After Landing checklist was completed. The crew received taxi instructions, and after crossing runway 30L, he made a right turn onto taxiway A. They made a slight gradual turn into the gate area. He had just started to turn into the gate from taxiway A when the nose wheel steering failed. The first officer then advised Ground Control that they were experiencing steering problems and would probably have to be towed to the gate. He then called MAINT and told them the same thing. Then the captain  lost the brakes. The first officer stated that he saw the captain's hands ""come up"" and apply reverse thrust. The airplane came to a stop. The first officer stated that he called maintenance again and told them that they had lost steering and brakes and that they needed to have the airplane chocked. maintenance asked if they would shut down the engines and the captain said, no, he needed them first officer the reversers. The first officer stressed that they needed to get somebody out there right away; they were in a very precarious situation. maintenance said they would have somebody out as soon as they could. The first officer made a PA announcement to the passengers telling them that the airplane was experiencing a system malfunction; they were going to stay put and then be towed to the gate. At 19:36 they began to slowly roll first officer ward. The captain He tried using the engine reverse thrust to stop the airplane, but the thrust reversers did not deploy. As the DC-9 started moving towards a Northwest Airlines A.319 (N368NB) and impacted the A319 with a speed of approximately 16 mph.

While taxiing westbound to the gate, airport operations requested him to hold on the taxiway between A4 and A5, to give a Delta Air Lines pushback crew some room to move another airplane. After stopping, he set the brakes, and made a passenger announcement. Approximately 3 minutes later, the airplane was struck from the left rear by a snowplow. The force of the impact pushed the left main landing gear forward approximately 10 feet, turning the airplane to the right as it rotated about its right main landing gear. The captain stated that he shut down the engines, requested an assessment from the flight attendants, and told the first officer to call for fire equipment. He then surveyed the damage from the cockpit window and aft galley service door window. By that time, the snowplow had backed off to the east approximately 50 yards. The captain stated that the airport visibility was reported at 2 miles. However, he could see the Western State ""W"" on a hill, approximately 2.5 miles south of the airport. After an assessment of the damage and confirmation from the fire crew that it was safe, the airplane was towed to the ramp and the passengers were deplaned with the airstairs. The snow plow operator stated visibility was poor.  He said he was unsure of where the airplane was.  As he was plowing the taxiway ""out of nowhere was the 737.""  The driver applied brakes, but it was too late.  Following the accident, the airport made several changes to its operating procedures with respect to snowplow operations and radio communications with airport vehicles.  Probable Cause: the snowplow driver's failure to see the airplane during plowing operations.  Factors contributing to the accident were the snowplow driver's excessive speed and the snow.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DEN05LA048 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DEN05LA048 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates10-Oct-2022 18:27 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

Night instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. There were no injuries. The cross-country flight originated at Kansas City (MKC), Missouri, approximately 17:30. According to a written statement submitted by the captain, they had flown the GPS approach to runway 35. When they did not see the runway or runway environment they initiated a missed approach. During the missed approach procedure, they were able to see the first 4 to 5 thousand feet on the approach end of runway 17. They ""elected to circle to the north west to set up for a visual approach to runway 17."" The captain stated that the approach was ""slightly high and as a result, the flare was a bit higher than normal."" The airplane entered the fog layer just prior to touchdown. The captain stated that during the landing flare the airplane drifted to the left and ""the aircraft settled onto the runway to the left of centerline and shortly thereafter the left main gear impacted a snow berm."" The airplane turned hard to the left and departed the runway. The nose gear separated, the radome was crushed and the cockpit pressure bulkhead was compromised. An examination of the airplane's systems, conducted by the FAA, revealed no anomalies.

Despite this, he continued to taxi, but because the lever remained stiff, he decided to contact the company operations and the Control Tower to return to the platform. On returning, at the turn between taxiways echo and alpha, the captain lost the effectiveness of the brakes and steering, causing the aircraft to crash into the hangar of the Mapiex company, damaging the aircraft and the wall of the hangar. CONCLUSIONS: The cause of the accident was due to a failure in the hydraulic system's pump pressure, which made it impossible for the crew to control the aircraft's braking and steering.

Weather at Manchester however was foggy and the pilot was unable to land there. The pilot then requested to proceed to his alternate destination, Burlington. During the flight to Burlington, the pilot was contacted by company dispatch and it was agreed that Bennington would be a better destination because it was 45 miles closer than Burlington. As the flight progressed towards Bennington, the pilot contacted ATC and requested to change his destination to Keene. Weather at Keene included winds from 350 degrees at 3 knots; 1 statute mile of visibility; an overcast cloud layer at 100 feet agl. The Bandeirante flew an ILS approach to runway 02. When the airplane broke out of the clouds, it was not stable. Approaching the runway, at full flaps and exceeding the 25 percent maximum for a go-around, the pilot added full power to the left engine. The high power setting, slow airspeed, and full flaps combination resulted in a minimum control speed (Vmc) roll. No determination could be made as to why the right engine was inoperative, and there were no mechanical or fuel-related anomalies found that would have precluded normal operation. The airplane came to rest inverted on runway 02, about 90 feet from the approach end. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The pilot's improper decision to attempt a single-engine missed approach with the airplane in a slow airspeed, full flap configuration, which resulted in a minimum control speed (Vmc) roll. Contributing factors included an inoperative engine for undetermined reasons, the pilot's in-flight decision to divert to an airport with low ceilings and visibility while better conditions existed elsewhere, the pilot's failure to advise or seek assistance from air traffic control or his company, and the low cloud ceilings, fog, and night lighting conditions.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NYC05FA042 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, TX (DFW); May 1989 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft had earlier departed the aerodrome on a charter flight with one pilot and seven passengers on board. The pilot had elected to return to the airport after detecting a problem during the retraction of the aircraft's landing gear. He attempted to manually extend the landing gear, but was unable to confirm that the landing gear had locked in position for the subsequent precautionary landing. The main landing gear collapsed as the aircraft touched down. Examination of the aircraft landing gear by the aircraft operator revealed an incorrectly installed thrust bearing in the hydraulic actuator for the left main landing gear. The result was that the axial loads normally carried by the thrust bearing were transferred to the actuator's pinion gears which fractured under abnormal operational loads. That damage seized the actuator and prevented the manual extension of the aircraft's landing gear by the pilot.Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  9 April 2007 VH-SGT Network Aviation Australia 0 Perth Airport, WA (PER) sub Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Estimated flying time was 1 hour and 29 minutes. The copilot was Pilot Flying. Weather at the destination, Oviedo-Asturias Airport, was poor with rain, fog and a cloud base of 300 ft. The flight crew decided to hold at FL100 over the Asturias VOR. The captain assumed the role of Pilot Flying at this time. Once the weather improved, approaches to runway 29 resumed. Two aircraft landed before flight JK5811 without reporting any problems. Since the cloud base was between 200 and 400 ft, the flight was force to make an ILS approach to runway 29, which meant a landing with a tail wind as winds were reported from 050Â° at 10 kt with gusts to 18 kt. The tail wind component was calculated to be 5-9,5 knots and the aircraft's tail wind limit was 10 knots. When the aircraft was at 270 ft, the crew reported runway in sight. Nine seconds later and twelve seconds before touchdown, the captain disconnected the autopilot. The autothrottle system remained active. Descent rate fluctuated, at times reaching 1000 ft/min. The pilot stated that at about 50 ft he observed an uncommanded descent of the aircraft and tried to compensate by increasing the engine thrust. On touchdown the vertical acceleration reached 4.11g. The aircraft bounced and touched down again, with one of the wheels hitting a runway edge light on the right hand side. Spoilers then extended and the thrust reversers were activated by the crew. The aircraft decellerated normally and taxied to the platform. Substantial damage to the airframe was noted. The captain sustained serious spinal injuries. He was briefly incapacitated after the first touchdown, forcing the copilot to take control during the bounce. Causes (translated from Spanish): It is considered that the probable cause of the accident was a significant variation in the intensity and wind direction at the time of landing prompting a 4.11g vertical acceleration, however, with the weather information available, it could not be determined if there were objective conditions for the possibility of windshear during landing. A contributing factor was the maneuver made by the aircraft, which is not consistent with a standard maneuver, since it there were variations in pitch, from 84 ft radio altimeter and a decrease of the plane relative to the ILS glide slope combined with the performance of autothrotle at idle and possible variations of wind in the final phase of landing which would place the aircraft on a path other than the nominal.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIAIAC Report number: A-013/2005 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 years and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The en route part of the flight was uneventful. The flight crew established radio contact with DÃ¼sseldorf Radar at 05:43. The crew were told that runway 23L was in use.  Two minutes later the radar controller contacted flight 8995: ""I just talked to the tower and ah for the time being braking action on all parts of the runway is supposed to be good. They are measuring again right now because it started to snow again and I'll keep you advised."" The flight was then cleared to descend to FL80. The flight crew decided to set the autobrakes for landing on Medium, to account for the snow. At 05:50 the radar controller again contacted the flight about the current weather circumstances: ""...latest update on the weather situation ahm the friction tester has reported braking action to be good for the moment however as its continuing to snow they are ah afraid that it might worsen, so they are going to do another friction test right before you land."" In the following minutes the flight was given descent instructions and vectors for an approach to runway 23L. At 05:54 the controller radioed: ""weather update we now have a surface wind of three four zero degrees eleven knots, that's slight tail wind component by two knots. Visibility is down to one thousand five hundred meters, still in snow showers and ah cloud base is now five hundred feet only."" The flight was subsequently cleared for the approach. At 05:57 the radar controller instructed the crew to contact DÃ¼sseldorf Tower. The Tower controller stated: ""Good morning,... we are just waiting for the braking action values from the friction tester stand by a second. The surface wind is actually three three zero degrees one two knots."" Two minutes later the controller radioed: ""... the braking action was measured to be medium at all parts. And ah the visibility dropped right now due to the heavy snow showers at the field ah. The RVR value at the touch down zone is presently nine hundred meters, at the mid-point one thousand one hundred meters and ah stop end one thousand one hundred meters."" At that moment the flight was 3,5 nautical miles out. The flight was subsequently cleared to land. The airplane touched down about 1700 ft (518 m) past the runway threshold. Ground spoilers and thrust reversers deployed and the autobrakes activated. Still the airplane did not decelerate as expected and the pilot applied manual braking. The airplane failed to stop and overran the runway end. It collided with ILS aerials, which caused a fire in engines no. 2 and no. 3. The aircraft was withdrawn from use at DÃ¼sseldorf until being scrapped there in April 2006. Causes: The accident is attributable to the fact that the braking values transmitted to the crew did not meet the conditions that had arisen as a result of heavy snowfall since the last measurement on the runway. Contributing factors: - Fast changing weather - The lack of an in all weather conditions reliable measurement method for the determination of braking coefficient.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BFU Report number: BFU AX001-05 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 8 years and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) Felix Goetting; DÃ¼sseldorf Airport (DUS); 24 January 2005 photo (c) Felix Goetting; DÃ¼sseldorf Airport (DUS); 24 January 2005 photo (c) Felix Goetting; DÃ¼sseldorf Airport (DUS); 24 January 2005 photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Miami International Airport, FL (MIA); February 2000 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Night instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The flight was en route to MCI to pick up passengers and continue on as an on-demand charter but diverted to the Kansas City-Charles B. Wheeler Downtown Airport (MKC) following the closure of MCI. MCI was closed due to a McDonnell Douglas MD83 sliding off a taxiway during an after landing taxi on contaminated runway/taxiway conditions. MKC held a limited airport certificate that did not have a snow removal plan and was served by runway 19 (7,002 feet by 150 feet, grooved asphalt). Following a precision approach and landing on runway 19 at MKC, the Learjet 35A slid off the departure end of the runway and impacted airport property and terrain. The Learjet 35A was operated with inoperative thrust reversers as per the airplane's minimum equipment list at the time of the accident. About 1:05 hours before the accident, runway 19 Tapley values were recorded as 21-22-22 with 1/2 inch of wet snow. About 17 minutes before the accident, MKC began snow removal operations. About 7 minutes before the accident, the MKC air traffic control tower (TWR) instructed the snow removal vehicles to clear the runway for inbound traffic. TWR was advised by airport personnel that runway 19 was plowed and surface conditions were 1/4 inch of snow of snow; friction values were not taken or reported. While inbound, the Learjet 35A requested any braking action reports from TWR. The first airplane to land was a Cessna 210 Centurion, and the pilot reported braking action to the TWR as ""moderate"", which was then transmitted by TWR as ""fair"" from a Centurion in response to the Learjet 35A's query. The Cessna 210 Centurion pilot did not use brakes during landing and did not indicate this to TWR during his braking action report. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The contaminated runway conditions during landing. Contributing factors were the operation of the airplane without thrust reversers, flight to the planned alternate airport not performed by the flightcrew, and the insufficient runway information.

There were no injuries among the 22 passengers and three crew members. Danish Air Transport flight DTR54 was on a scheduled flight from Bergen to FlorÃ¸ (FRO). During takeoff the pilots experienced considerable control problems related to the elevator function. They declared an emergency situation and returned for landing. The landing was accomplished without further incident 7 minutes after takeoff. After landing it was found that the control problems were caused by the right elevator hanging below the horizontal stabiliser, attached only by the inboard of the three hinges that normally connect the elevator to the stabiliser. A bolt was missing from both the centre and outer hinges. Both of the bolts and one of the nuts that normally should connect the hinge assemblies together were found. One of the bolts was found on the runway, the other inside the elevator. Investigation indicates that the bolt belonging to the outer hinge assembly fell out during the takeoff in question, while the bolt in the centre hinge assembly had fallen out at an earlier point in time, without being discovered. The report concludes that the self-locking nuts cannot have been tightened with the required torque when the elevator was fitted. This error was most probably introduced after the aircraft was repainted in 1999. Significant investigation results: The control problems experienced by the crew during take-off and the rest of the flight began when the outboard of the three hinge bolts that attach the right elevator to the stabiliser loosened and fell out. As the centre bolt had fallen out at an earlier point in time without being discovered, the elevator was hanging in place only attached by the inboard hinge. The self-locking nuts that should hold the centre and outboard hinge bolts in place cannot have been tightened with the required torque.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIBN Report number: 8/2006 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) AIBN; Bergen-Flesland Airport (BGO); 31 January 2005; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft was owned by Nord-Flyg and operated under the name NTD Air Cargo. After landing, the pilot taxied to apron number four in the southeastern corner of the aerodrome and unloaded the cargo from Sweden. After having done that he left the airport and went to a suite the company reserves for the crew to rest before the return leg to Sweden, which was planned for the following afternoon. As per standard policy, the company operates the aircraft with a two person crew. On the day in question the co-pilot had taken ill and the pilot had flown alone. The return leg to Sweden was also planned as a one-person crew flight. The following morning the aircraft was refuelled with 420 l of Jet A-1, in accordance with the pilotÂs instructions. All in all ca. 725 kg of fuel was reserved for the return leg. It had been snowing at the airport until 11:20 and the temperature was hovering at around zero degrees Celsius. After having arrived at the airport at 16:30, the pilot began to brush the accumulated snow and frozen snow melt off the upper surfaces of the aircraft. As per his account, there was a great deal of snow and ice on the aircraft. He did not, however, manage to brush all of the impurities off of the surfaces of the aircraft. The cargo going to Sweden did not arrive in time for him to fly it to Skavsta, his primary destination. Therefore, he phoned in a change to the flight plan choosing Ãrebro instead as his destination.  At 18:52:45 the pilot acknowledged on Helsinki Control Tower (TWR) that he was taxiing to takeoff position runway 22L at intersection Y. At 16:54:40 TWR gave him takeoff clearance from that intersection and gave him the wind direction. The pilot later said that he executed a normal takeoff, using 10 degrees of flaps. The aircraft lifted off at the normal speed of 80-90 kts. All went well until he reached the height of 800-1000 ft (250-300 m) and retracted the trailing edge flaps. Immediately after flap retraction, the pilot lost control of the aircraft, which began turning to the right. The pilot attempted to fly the aircraft to the end section of runway 22R to make an emergency landing but the aircraft crashed into the terrain between the runways. DIRECT CAUSAL FACTORS: ""The chain of events can be regarded as having begun when the aeroplane stood overnight on the tarmac, exposed to the weather. Snowfall accumulated on the upper surfaces of the fuselage, wings and stabilizers during the night forming a thick coat of ice and snow as it partly melted during the day and refroze when the ambient temperature dropped towards the evening.  The pilot noticed the impurities when he performed a walkaround check. However, he did not order a de-icing. Instead, he tried to remove the ice with a brush. It is only possible to remove dry and loose snow by brushing. In this case the frozen water that had trickled down remained stuck to surfaces. The pilot executed a takeoff with an aircraft whose aerodynamic properties were fundamentally degraded due to impurities. During the initial climb, immediately after flap retraction, airflow separated from the surface of the wing and the pilot did not manage to regain control of the aircraft. The pilot did not recognize the stall for what is was and did not act in the required manner to recover or, then again, it could be that he had not received sufficient training for these kinds of situations."" cONTRIBUTING CAUSAL FACTORS: ""Several factors are considered to have affected the pilotÂs actions. He was either ignorant or negligent as to the effect of impurities on the aeroplaneÂs aerodynamic properties. Furthermore, the pressure of keeping to the schedule during the early preflight briefing activities may have affected his decision, even though a change in the flight plan eliminated the actual rush. It is the impression of the investigation commission that these factors were the principal ones that contributed to the omission of proper deicing. A probable contributing factor, albeit one difficult to verify, could have been the financial aspect. The company may have considered buying de-icing services from an external service provider as an additional expense. Investigations showed that the operator in question had ordered aeroplane de-icing at HelsinkiÂVantaa airport only once during the previous and ongoing winter season. The company regularly flew to this airport. Processes were in place for pre-flight briefing as well as for freight forwarding. However, the flight schedules with reference to the opening times of the companyÂs primary destination airport did not allow for long delays in ground operations. This may have partly put pressure on the pilot to complete the other pre-flight activities as soon as possible. As for the flap setting, the pilotÂs takeoff technique was not proper for the existing circumstances. Moreover, when the aeroplane stalled, the pilot did not execute any effective corrective action to regain control of the aircraft. These would have been, among other things: having reset the flaps to the position prior to the stall as well as having taken advantage of the engine power reserve. As per his account, the pilot did not utilize all available engine power. Instead, he stuck to the maximum value prescribed for normal operations as specified in the aircraft operations manual. The fact that the said flight was flown, contrary to normal operations with only a one person crew, can be considered a contributing factor.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIB Finland Report number: B2/2005L Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ    Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

When takeoff speed was reached the pilot tried to lift the plane off the runway but, according to his statement the control wheel was stuck. He then aborted the takeoff, but the plane skidded off the runway. It went through the perimeter fence, crossed a highway and crashed into a building. About 15 people were injured, one critically, but nobody was killed, officials said. The injured included two people in cars along the highway. Preliminary investigation results indicate that the airplane's center of gravity (CG) was well forward of the allowable limit.  On December 16, 2003 another Challenger jet aborted takeoff at Teterboro when the flightcrew was unable to rotate the airplane. The aircraft overran the runway. In this case, the NTSB determined that the plane was above the maximum gross takeoff weight, and outside the forward center-of-gravity envelope. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of the accident was the flight crewÂs failure to ensure the airplane was loaded within weight and balance limits and their attempt to take off with the center of gravity well forward of the forward takeoff limit, which prevented the airplane from rotating at the intended rotation speed.

Visibility was reported 2 kilometers with snow, ceiling 2200 feet broken. wind calm and altimeter setting QNH 1016. When the aircraft was 35 miles west of the Kabul VOR, radar contact was established with Bagram. The aircraft was advised by Bagram to cross the VOR at or above flight level 130 and cleared it for the VOR/DME approach to runway 29 at Kabul Airport. At 10:48 UTC the aircraft reported flight level 130. Bagram again cleared the aircraft for the VOR approach to runway 29 and advised the aircraft to report procedure turn inbound. The crew replied that they would report proceeding inbound for the VOR approach to runway 29. This was the last transmission from the aircraft. Search for the aircraft was delayed and hampered due to a severe snowstorm in the region. The aircraft was located approximately three days later by an International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) helicopter The Flight Data Recorder (FDR) was recovered, but the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) could not be found. No data was found recorded on the FDR. Probable Cause: ""The accident occurred probably due to the premature descent by the Aircraft below its minimum assigned altitude of 13,000 feet during approach in weather conditions below VFR requirements. The reason for descending below the minimum altitude could not be determined due to inadequate evidence.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CAO Afghanistan Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 12 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  Reuters   Location  Images: photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Sharjah Airport (SHJ); January 2005 photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Miami International Airport, FL (MIA); February 2000 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates02-Jan-2025 10:35 ASN Updated [Destination airport, Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane touched down hard and went off the left side of the runway. It ran over a trench, causing the left hand main undercarriage leg to collapse. The airplane came to rest on uneven terrain at the side of the runway. Probable cause of the accident (translated from French): - Poor weight and balance assessment reported to the Pilot-in-command prior to take-off. During the flight from Dakar to Tambacounda this was not felt because the autopilot was engaged. On approach, the autopilot disengaged and induced an alteration of the speed parameters. To maintain the altitude, the pilot was obliged to increase the power resulting in a speed higher than that recommended, with poor control of the airplane in short final. - After the runway excursion,  the plane's contact with the trenches and sand piles caused by works, contributed to the degradation of certain parts of the aircraft.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ANACS Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  22 November 2024 RA-67261 Polar Airlines 0 Yakutsk Airport (YKS/UEEE) min 10 January 2025 RA-67261 Polar Airlines 0 near Yakutsk airport (YKS/UEEE), Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) non Location  Images: photo (c) anonymous; Tambacounda Airport (TUD); 06 February 2005 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane was about 7 minutes from landing, and the flight attendant was completing his before landing checklist when turbulence was encountered.  After regaining consciousness a few seconds later, he was able to get to an empty passenger seat.  A deadheading flight attendant assumed the incapacitated flight attendant's duties.  Review and analysis of available weather data and forecast products showed that airman's meteorological information (AIRMET) Update 6 was issued by the National Weather Service (NWS) and in effect for the flight for occasional moderate turbulence below 12,000 feet.  A review of the meteorological data showed that the airplane was operating in conditions that would have supported at least moderate turbulence below 10,000 feet msl.  The weather packet included in the flight release provided to the flight crew by the airline's dispatch prior to the flight contained information for AIRMET Update 3; however, AIRMET Update 6 (valid for the accident flight) was not listed.  Information contained on the release indicated to the crew that no moderate or greater turbulence was present along the route of flight.  At the time of the accident, the airline's contract weather provider evaluated current meteorological data and staff meteorologists used their judgment of the weather to issue a SIGMEC (significant meteorological conditions, a company issued advisory) based on the current weather conditions.  NWS-issued SIGMET Yankee was canceled at 1630 because the current pilot reports (PIREPS) indicated that previously forecasted turbulent conditions had diminished.  Although an AIRMET was in effect at the time of the accident for moderate or greater turbulence, there were no other supporting indicators to the airline staff meteorologist that moderate or greater turbulence was present along the route of flight.  Due to the cancellation of the SIGMET and the lack of additional supporting information for moderate or greater turbulence, the meteorologist did not issue a SIGMEC.  Therefore, the turbulence information was not on the flight release provided to the flight crew. Probable Cause: the in-flight encounter with turbulence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: LAX05LA105 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB LAX05LA105 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  10 January 2001 N394AE American Eagle Airlines 0 San Antonio, TX non Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates25-Mar-2024 09:36 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

Approximately nine minutes before the landing, the co-pilot activated the aircraft radio control of aerodrome lighting (ARCAL) and contacted the approach UNICOM at Bromont. The Bromont Airport dispatcher informed the crew that only the PAPI was operational. A NOTAM had been issued on 17 February 2005, indicating that the runway edge lights would be out of order until 22:00 UTC, 22 February 2005. The PAPI and the approach lights lit up when the co-pilot activated the ARCAL, because their switches had been left on. At approximately 1000 feet (300 m) asl and five miles (8 km) from the threshold, the flight crew had the approach lights and the PAPI in sight. It was not evident whether the PAPI was positioned on the right or the left side of the runway. The airport chart published by Jeppesen indicated ""PAPI L"" (left). In response to a query from the crew, the Bromont dispatcher indicated that the PAPI was on the right side of the runway. From his location facing the aircraft, the PAPI was to the dispatcher's right. The approach was continued visually, keeping to the left of the PAPI. At approximately two miles (3,2 km) from the runway threshold, the co-pilot noticed that the approach lights were at his right. He reported his observation to the captain, who paid little attention to it. Less than two seconds before the crash, the co-pilot asked the captain whether he had the runway in sight. The captain did not reply and continued the descent until the aircraft touched down 300 feet (90 m) to the left of runway 05L, 1800 feet (550 m) beyond the threshold. When the captain realized that he was not on the runway, he applied full power to execute a missed approach; however, the aircraft hit a ditch approximately four feet (1,20 m) deep that was perpendicular to the flight path. The nose wheel and right landing gear collapsed. The aircraft came to a stop facing back the way it had come, after travelling a distance of 1800 feet during which it made a full turn followed by a 180-degree turn. FINDINGS AS TO CAUSES AND CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: 1. The flight crew attempted a night landing in the absence of runway edge lights. The aircraft touched down 300 feet to the left of Runway 05L and 1800 feet beyond the threshold. 2. The runway was not closed for night use despite the absence of runway edge lights. Nothing required it to be closed. 3. Poor flight planning, non-compliance with regulations and standard operating procedures (SOPs), and the lack of communications between the two pilots reveal a lack of airmanship on the part of the crew, which contributed to the accident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A05Q0024 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: TSB Report Number A05Q0024   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

As the captain continued to rotate the airplane, the tail section struck the ground, and the ""tail strike"" EICAS (Engine Indication and Crew Alerting System) message illuminated. The flight crew then completed the takeoff sequence, completed all checklists, jettisoned fuel, and returned to the airport where an uneventful landing was made. The winds recorded at the airport, about 1 minute after the accident, were from 280 degrees, at 21 knots, gusting to 28 knots. Review of the DFDR data revealed that at the time the takeoff roll began, the captain's control wheel was turned 25.5 degrees to the left, resulting in the upward deflection of the left wing outboard aileron, flaperon, and 6 of 7 spoilers, which was consistent with a correction for crosswind conditions. As the takeoff roll continued, the control wheel input varied between 19.6 degrees and 37.5 degrees to the left, and at the approximate point of rotation, the control wheel was turned to the left 38.4 degrees. The control column position also began to move aft at the point of rotation, with a force of 22.7 pounds, and the pitch of the airplane rose to 3 degrees nose up. As the pilot continued the rotation, he held the pitch control at a value consistent with previous recorded flights, before pulling the control column further aft, increasing the pitch angle to the tail strike attitude of approximately 13 degrees nose up. One second later, as both left and right main gear indicated no weight on wheels, the control column position reached its maximum value during the event, 9.2 degrees aft, and the pitch reached 17.8 degrees nose up. A Safety Board vehicle performance study compared the airspeed and groundspeed recorded during the accident, and determined that a wind gust caused an approximate 7 knot loss in airspeed, the lateral control wheel input during the rotation ranged from 24 to 37 degrees, and the maximum pitch rate during the rotation was approximately 6.0 degrees/second. Using these data in a Boeing estimation method, it was determined that three factors contributed to the reduced tail clearance during the takeoff. These factors were the loss of airspeed that resulted from a tailwind gust during the rotation, the loss of lift that resulted from the deflection of the lateral control surfaces, and a pitch rate in excess of that recommended. These factors combined for a total reduction in tail clearance of approximately 150-170 percent. It was concluded in the performance study that reducing the pitch rate to the Boeing recommended 2.5 degrees/second would have brought the tail clearance reduction to the 80 percent to 100 percent of nominal level, and from that point, a 1-knot increase in rotation speed would have provided about a 7 percent increase to the tail clearance margin. According to Boeing, the typical liftoff attitude was 8.5 degrees, the minimum tail clearance was 37 inches, and the tail strike pitch attitude was 12.1 degrees up. The operator's flight manual warned pilots to ""Avoid any tendency to rapidly rotate to a 10 degree pitch attitude and hold it until lift-off. This technique invites a tail strike."" In addition, neither Boeing, nor the operator, had procedures or policies for adding an increase in rotation speed to compensate for crosswind or tailwind conditions. Probable Cause: The captain's failure to follow company procedures, which resulted in a tail strike. Contributing were the gusty crosswind and tailwind conditions, and the manufacturer's failure to provide adequate performance planning data to account for gusty crosswinds during takeoff.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NYC05FA054 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 12 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB NYC05FA054 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates10-Oct-2022 16:47 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

After confirming no danger to their airplane, they discovered that one of the flight attendants had injured her elbow.  The captain returned the airplane to the gate, and the flight attendant was replaced.  Two additional flight attendants reported ""some bruising"" but felt able to continue the flight.  En route, one of the two flight attendants advised the captain of back pain, and the other felt sick to her stomach.   After landing, the two flight attendants were taken to a hospital for further evaluation.  One of the two flight attendants was released, but the other remained in the hospital in excess of 48 hours with a herniated disk.   According to the first officer, the reason he told the captain to stop was because another airplane was on the crossing runway.  The first officer thought it could be holding number one for takeoff, and wanted to ensure that his airplane was on the correct taxiway before crossing the runway.  Probable Cause: The first officer's misjudgment of a perceived threat, which resulted in the captain's excessive braking and subsequent injury to a flight attendant.

The airplane landed normally on runway 29L at Tehran-Mehrabad. After compression of the main struts of the landing gear, the spoilers were extended. At the same time the reverser on the left engine was brought to maximum mode. The reverse thrust lever of the right engine was not used since the reverser was deactivated. After deceleration to a speed of 80 knots the reverse thrust lever of the left engine was brought to the intermediate position between maximum and minimum reverse thrust. As this was happening the throttle control lever of the right engine was brought from idle to the position of ~55 degrees according to FDR data. Further movement of the reverse thrust lever of the right engine was accompanied by the simultaneous shifting of the throttle control lever of the left engine practically as far as the nominal mode.  At this moment the airplane captain interfered in the control, shifted the throttle control lever of the right engine to idle and again activated maximum reverse of the left engine. However, in spite of the actions taken, the airplane overshot the runway at a speed of about 40 knots.Sources: Final Report on the accident on 8 July 2006 in Irkutsk, to the Airbus 310-324 registered F-OGYP, operated by OAO Aviakompania Sibir / Interstate Aviation Committee   Location  Images: photo (c) anon.; Tehran-Mehrabad Airport (THR); 07 March 2005 photo (c) anon.; Tehran-Mehrabad Airport (THR); 07 March 2005 photo (c) anon.; Tehran-Mehrabad Airport (THR); 07 March 2005 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The two pilots and two passengers were not injured. Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight that departed Columbus-Port Columbus International Airport, Ohio. Prior to the day of the incident, the pilot and copilot had not flown together. In addition, the copilot spoke broken English. The copilot obtained the current ATIS information about 150 miles from the destination airport. Although the ATIS information reported thin slush on all surfaces, the captain had not asked about runway conditions, and the copilot did not relay the information regarding runway conditions.  The flightcrew continued the approach in moderate to severe turbulence, and performed pre-landing checks. Due to the turbulence, the flightcrew missed several radio transmissions, including the aircraft ahead them that reported a go-around, and later reported good braking action. The incident airplane turned onto final approach for runway 01; a 7,000-foot-long, 150-foot-wide, asphalt runway. During the final approach, the landing gear was down and flaps were in the 25-degree extended position. Air Traffic Control (ATC) relayed the good braking action report to the incident flightcrew, based upon the previous arrival aircraft. However, the previous arrival aircraft was equipped with thrust reversers, and the incident airplane was not. ATC also provided two wind checks to the incident airplane while on final approach. The wind checks were reported as 340 degrees at 15 knots, and 340 degrees at 20 knots, respectively. The pilot reported that due to the wind, he flew the final approach without full flaps, at Vref plus 20 (139 knots), and slowed to 134 knots over the runway threshold.  After touchdown the airplane failed to stop on the runway and overran.  The airplane came to rest approximately 230 feet beyond the departure end of runway 1. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The pilot in command's inadequate in-flight planning, which resulted in an overrun landing on a contaminated runway. Factors were inadequate crew coordination, gusty winds, and a slush covered runway.

During the flight, the #1 Hydraulic Low Pressure caution light illuminated. Due to this, the ground spoilers would not be available on landing and a 1.13 landing distance penalty was needed to be applied to the landing runway. The flight was cleared to land on runway 1L. The reported winds were 290 degrees at 10 knots, and the braking action was reported as fair. The captain reported the braking action was nil with no traction on the runway. The airplane departed the left side of the runway about 4,600 feet from the approach end of runway 1L. The airplane veered across the grass infield before crossing runway 07R/25L. The airplane traveled through the intersection of taxiways A, E, and T before crossing another snow-covered grass in-field where the aircraft went through a snow bank and back onto taxiway B. The airplane stopped near the intersection of taxiway B and M in front of concourse D. The captain reported that nothing appeared to be wrong with the airplane so the decision was made to taxi to gate E64. An examination of the airplane revealed that the forward pressure bulkhead at Fuselage Station 202.75 was compromised.

The flight had departed LaGuardia International Airport en route to Milwaukee International Airport (MKE).  During climbout through Flight Level 20 (20,000 feet), the No. 1 Hydraulic Low Pressure caution light illuminated.  The flight crew ran the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) checklist for the caution message.  The procedures outlined in the QRH instructed the flight crew to: ""Land at the nearest suitable airport.""  The captain informed the airline's maintenance control about the caution message, but he did not inform flight dispatch about the caution message or the need to land at the nearest suitable airport.  The flight continued to its destination airport.  The flight was cleared to land on runway 1L.  The winds were 290 degrees at 10 knots.  The captain reported that the landing was normal until the airplane started to veer off the left side of the runway.  The post accident inspection of the airplane revealed no preexisting anomalies, other than the loss of the No. 1 Hydraulic system which resulted in the loss of ground spoilers.  The NTSB Aircraft Performance Study indicated that the airplane approached runway 1L crossing the threshold at about 2302:16 at a recorded radio altitude of about 50 feet above ground level, with an indicated airspeed of 139 knots (about 136 knots ground speed) and a pitch angle of about 4 degrees nose down.  The airplane began to drift right of centerline by about 20 feet, and touchdown occurred at a calculated distance of 2,400 feet beyond the runway threshold in a crab angle of about 5 degrees nose left relative to the ground track, and at a roll angle of about 1 degree left bank angle. The lateral load at touchdown was recorded at -0.2 G's. After touchdown, the airplane's ground track continued to drift right of centerline about 25 feet while the airplane nose remained to the left of the ground track. The airplane's ground track then began to turn left and departed off the side of the runway (veered off the runway) at about 2302:37 and approximately 4,200 feet beyond the threshold. The longitudinal acceleration from point of touchdown to when it veered off the runway was recorded between -0.12 and -0.15 G's.  An investigation of airport operations revealed that airport operations did not inspect Runway 1L/19R after a pilot report (PIREP) of NIL braking action by a Beech Jet at 2018.  Airport operations did not conduct or provide friction measurement reports and (Notices to Airmen) NOTAMS for Runway 1L/19R between March 10 at 1925 and the time of the accident on March 11 at 2302, when airport conditions were changing with significant snowfall accumulations.  The airport did not conduct a runway inspection or friction report of Runway 1L/19R after the airplane veered off the runway. Probable Cause: the captain's failure to adequately compensate for the crosswind conditions, and his failure to maintain directional control during landing.  Contributing factors include the captain's failure to land at the nearest suitable airport after an in-flight mechanical problem, the airport operation's failure to conduct runway friction tests and to issue NOTAMS in accordance with existing regulations, the crosswind, the snow-covered runway, the runway sign, and night conditions.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CHI05FA077 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB CHI05FA077 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  11 March 2005 N8932C Northwest Airlink, lsf Pinnacle Airlines 0 Milwaukee-General Mitchell International Airport, WI (MKE) sub Runway excursion Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates25-Mar-2024 09:35 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

CONCLUSIONS: ""The Aviation Accident Investigation Commission of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, determines on the probable cause(s) of the accident, as follows: The impact of the aircraft against the ground without loss of control due to the deficient dispatch, planning, execution of the Checklists and CRM of the crew allowing the takeoff and rotation run to start with overweight (25,798kgs) and 0Â° of flap since for a weight of 25,000kgs corresponded 15 Â° of flaps according to the Flight Manual of the aircraft. Likewise, the failure to abort the takeoff when the configuration alarm did not function.

The pilot allocated to the flight had not flown for 32 days; he was therefore required to complete a short flight at Glasgow to regain currency before landing to collect a paramedic for the flight to Campbeltown Airport. Poor weather at Campbeltown Airport necessitated an instrument approach. There was neither radar nor Air Traffic Control Service at the airport, so the pilot was receiving a Flight Information Service from a Flight Information Service Officer in accordance with authorised procedures. After arriving overhead Campbeltown Airport, the aircraft flew outbound on the approach procedure for runway 11 and began a descent. The pilot next transmitted that he had completed the Âbase turnÂ, indicating that he was inbound to the airport and commencing an approach. The airplane had gradually descended below the minimum altitude With a slight left wing low attitude, the airplane contacted the sea. It broke up after impact and sank. CAUSAL FACTORS:  ""1. The pilot allowed the aircraft to descend below the minimum altitude for the aircraftÂs position on the approach procedure, and this descent probably continued unchecked until the aircraft flew into the sea. 2.

On the last leg of the flight, the pilots attempted a VFR approach, which was not permitted for this airport. The aircraft descended, below the glide slope as the crew mistook the motorway for the runway. They entered a sideslip for more than 20 seconds when the pilot tried to align with the 'runway' causing the aircraft to lose speed. A stall developed at a height of 26 metres and the left wing struck a sand heap 4217 metres before the runway threshold causing the aircraft to crash 30 metres further on. The Commission found that the cause of the crash was the collision of the aircraft with the ground at the final stage of the approach due to its exit to the overcritical angles of attack and the stalling regime (an off-flight flight regime) at low altitude. The deceleration of the aircraft to the stall speed was due to its withdrawal, as a result of the control actions of the commander of the aircraft, to the flight mode with slip and maintaining this mode for a long time (more than 20 seconds) with insufficient engine operation and lack of control by the crew of the airspeed. Possible errors in the indications of a number of instruments (speed indicators, angle of attack indicator) could make it difficult for crew members to control flight parameters.Sources: Aviatsiya.ru  Gazeta.ru  Michael Roch  Russian Ministry of Transport  RIA Novosti  ITAR-TASS   Location  Images: photo (c) Reynold Camilleri; Yakutsk Airport (YKS); 12 August 2003 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

A helicopter was called in the extinguish the fire. Since the fire spread rapidly, a second helicopter was ordered, but there were no helicopters available. The Department of Civil Protection was contacted to send a fire fighting airplane.  A Canadair CL-415 departed Roma-Ciampino Airport (CIA) at 16:28 on a fire fighting mission. It arrived at the scene of the fire at 17:20. After a survey of the scene the crew commenced their mission. At 18:04, immediately after releasing the water, the airplane contacted the cable guard of a power line. The right hand float separated from the wing and a fire erupted on the severed wing. The pilots lost control and the airplane came down in a residential area, crashing into an unoccupied house. PROBABLE CAUSES AND CAUSAL FACTORS (translated from Italian) The accident was triggered by the collision of the aircraft against the cable guard of a power line during a fire fighting mission. The collision was caused by an inadequate trajectory towards the front of the fire. The damage suffered as a result of the impact against the power line  seriously compromised the controllability of the aircraft, affecting a positive outcome of the emergency. The following causal factors may have contributed to the dynamics of the accident: - Poor decision making in attacking the fire, causing the crew to focus their attention on obstacles (pylons) of Power Line No 500, without considering the presence of the cable guard line n.550; - The reduced visibility of obstacles resulting from the smoke of the forest; - The inadequate reporting of electricity pylons and associated overhead lines; - Non-activation of the required radio links, so the crew could not receive reports on the presence of obstacles; - Short and discontinuous experience of the captain in that role, coming from the institution of the ""PIC Frozen""; - The combination of to similar qualified pilots (""PIC Frozen"") in the cockpit for the operation of a flight, one just rehabilitated to a high command function, the other still employed in the role of co-pilot: This condition could have a negative impact in terms of crew integration, obscuring decision making; - The existence of criticality in corporate manuals used at the date of the accident; - Reduced operational capacity of the crew in the last phase of flight, resulting from the strong heat of the fire under the left wing which penetrated the airplane through an opening created by the separation of a porthole.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ANSV Report number: - Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; January 2002 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The crew initially selected flaps 30% for the approach and then selected the landing gear down. The landing gear was reportedly slow to extend, however a 3-green gear down indication was eventually displayed. When the flaps were selected to 100% prior to landing, the gear unsafe aural warning sounded and the crew executed a missed approach. On the overshoot the gear was selected up, the 3 green indication remained and the landing gear unsafe light was illuminated. The crew chose to divert to Winnipeg where maintenance was available. While en route back to Winnipeg, the crew accomplished the relevant abnormal checklist (Landing with Landing Gear Unsafe), and declared an emergency. At no time did the 3 green indication extinguish. On arrival in Winnipeg after gear extension, the crew requested a fly-by, where ground personnel advised that the gear appeared to be down. The landing was accomplished successfully, however the aircraft was stopped on runway 36, in order to accomplish a visual inspection. At this time a crew member noticed that the nose gear was not fully extended, and attempted to move the gear into the locked position by pushing on it. The nose gear did move; however, the left main gear collapsed. Runway 36 was closed for about 5 hours while the aircraft was removed.Sources: CADORS 2005C0553  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane was to make scheduled refueling stops at Khartoum and Benghazi. The crew decided to take off from runway 30, heading towards Lake Victoria. The airplane was configured for a takeoff weight of 174 tons with the stabilizer set at -3.3 degrees. The actual weight was probably around 182 tons, which was still within limits. The aircraft lifted off the runway at 263 kph after rolling for about 2800 metres. It subsequently climbed to 29 m at which altitude it leveled off for 4.5 seconds. After that the airplane began to descend gradually. Four seconds into descent, the commander ordered the retraction of flaps. By this time the aircraft was already descending at the rate of 3.5 m/sec and the speed was increasing. At the last moment they noted that the descent and suddenly initiated a climb. The airplane then contacted the water and crashed. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The accident was caused by aircraft colliding with the water surface shortly after take off. While the aircraft had gathered sufficient energy to sustain climb, the crew failed to monitor altitude and react correctly in the short time that the aircraft was airborne. This resulted in the aircraft going into descent till it reached an altitude where recovery was not possible.

The aircraft operated on a round trip from Havana to Caracas and back. The first officer was pilot flying for the return leg. The initial part of the takeoff was performed by the captain. After reaching a speed of 150 km/h the captain handed over the flight controls to the first officer. After passing through 220-230 km/h, the pilot noticed that he had no control of the elevator and immediately reported the failure to the captain, who again took the controls to verify the anomaly. During this check, approximately 11 seconds passed and the airplane's speed reached 282 km/h, while covering some 693 meters. The aircraft now had covered a total runway distance of 2230 meters, leaving 815 meters of runway remaining for braking. The takeoff was aborted but the aircraft was not able to stop on the remaining runway. The landing gear separated after running over a channel located approximately 20 meters after the runway. The aircraft came to a stop on a downslope. CAUSES:  Human Factor, Material Factor and Physical Factor and taking into account the characteristics of the Accident and the evidence gathered during the course of the investigation, considers the Human Factor as the causal factor of this accident due to the following: - The flight crew did not perform the respective manual check of the flight controls (elevators). - The flight crew did not perform the visual check on the panel of the locked/red and unlocked/green warning lights of the flight control surfaces (ailerons, elevators, directional rudder). - There was no adequate Cockpit Management, or assertive behavior by the crew, in terms of decision making during the takeoff abort. - There were no accurate calculations for takeoff speed references (V1-Vr-V2) in analogy to takeoff weights. - The evacuation of the passengers was not efficient and correct, since it was evidenced that the exit of the passengers was carried out through the least convenient doors, due to the position of the aircraft, which had to be blocked by the cabin crew. - There was no deployment of the slides for evacuation, which resulted in some passengers suffering dislocated limbs when they had to jump.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JIAAC Venezuela Report number: 017/2005 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: Agencia Cubana de Noticias   Location  Images: photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Havana-JosÃ© MartÃ­ International Airport (HAV/MUHA); January 2004 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

During takeoff from Mukalla's runway 06, at the speed 225 km/h, the nose landing gear retracted. The captain decided to abort the takeoff. He steered the plane to the left to avoid a collision with a radio-technical equipment car. The aircraft failed to stop on the runway and ran onto rugged sand terrain, 2 m below the runway level. The aircraft hit a hill and tilted to the right as it came to rest 400m from the runway end and 30m left from extended runway center line. Conclusions: The reason of this occurrence is early retraction of landing gears without order of the Captain before aircraft airborne. Actions of flight engineer in violation of technology of standard operating procedures, by fixing of landing gear switch to ""retract position"" after that to ""neutral"" without report to the Captain leaded to rise and development of occurrence.Sources: Arab News  Accident investigation final report   Location  Images: photo (c) Gerry & Bonni; Mukalla-Al-Rayyan International Airport (MKX); November 2011; (CC:by) photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Sharjah Airport (SHJ); 22 February 2004 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane was vectored onto the final approach course for the ILS 19 approach at Teterboro, New Jersey, and the captain configured the airplane to land.  He flew the approach at Vref plus 30 knots because of turbulence and reported wind gusts.  As he initiated a flare to land on runway 19, the airplane encountered windshear.  It touched down hard on the main landing gear, bounced, and then touched down again on the nose wheel.  The captain stabilized the airplane, slowed to taxi speed, and exited the runway.  Examination of the airplane revealed substantial damage to the pressure bulkhead in the vicinity of the nose gear box.

The controller cleared them for the approach, reported wind calm, pressure 29.94 in. Hg, a temperature of 26 degrees and requested the crew to report on finals. At 09:54:29 the crew reported on finals and were cleared to land. The F-28 touched down 4,5 meters short of runway 15 and struck the raised lip of the runway threshold. It continued for 112 m before veering to the left off the runway. The airplane ran another 263 m before it skidded to a stop against the wall of a company building. Runway 15 is a 2000 m long asphalt runway. Investigation revealed that the pilots thought the Coca runway was short. To be able to stop the plane on the runway without excessive use of the brakes, they decided to touch down as close to the threshold as possible. The correct procedure would be to pass over the threshold at 50 feet (15 m).

At 25 miles from Lima the crew there was a low fuel pressure warning. Approximately 22 miles from Lima the left engine was shut down. Within 3 miles of Lima the right engine lost power, and was also shut down. The crew declared an emergency. The pilot perform a 180 degrees turn due to the presence of gas tanks nearby. They turned to an agricultural field where an emergency landing was performed. On touchdown the airplane swung, sustaining substantial damage. Causes and contributing factors (translated from original Spanish report): 1. Operation with four consecutive flights made by the same crew to Chagual aerodrome (an aerodrome that demands a high alertness and situational awareness due to difficult topographical conditions), a long and exhausting day flying and working together with the multiple functions performed by the technical crew (dispatcher, payer, loader, cabin crew) probably decreased the performance and capacity of the technical crew and safety. 2. Poor planning on the part of the Operations and Sales Management of the Aero Condor Company Charter, by not providing the NOTAM which showed the lack of JET A1 fuel in Trujillo causing programming, operational and logistic difficulties.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIAA Report number: CIAA-ACCID-006-2005 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Images: photo (c) Capt.

He approached the airport from the northeast overflew the airport, and made a left turn to enter the downwind leg for runway 23. He saw some parachutes on the ground and some in the air. He saw a tandem jumper toward the southwest and believed he had accounted for all jumpers.  As he turned left, he saw a flash of colors, felt an impact and drag from the left wing. He got the airplane on the ground as soon as possible. Radar data indicated that the airplane was about 1,300 feet msl when it was approaching runway 5/23 from the northeast. The airplane flew over runway 23, near mid field, about 1,100 feet msl and was between 900 to 800 feet msl during the left bank entering the downwind for runway 23; last capture was at 300 feet as it approached runway 23. One jumper stated the parachute landing zone was located on the airport adjacent to the left side of runway 30. The video equipment that was carried by the cinematographer captured the collision. The cinematographer jumps with the last tandem jumpers. The tandem chute deploys at 3 minutes and 7 seconds into the video, 13 seconds later the cinematographer's chute deploys. During his descent, he removes the helmet-mounted camera and looks into the view making a few remarks about the jump. He places the camera back to its original position and continues to capture; the sky is overcast and visibility is good. The view pans to the right and captures three skydivers with chutes deployed at an altitude above him. At approximately 4 minutes and 54 seconds into the video, a sound similar to an airplane engine can be heard at an increasing level for 5 seconds. At 4 minutes and 59 seconds, the view pans slightly left and a sound similar to an impact is heard. The view becomes blurry and pans rapidly. At 5 minutes and 2 seconds, three frames capture what appears to be an aircraft in close proximity banking away and to the right of the camera's view. The view continues to pan rapidly for about 6 seconds showing shots of the ground, sky, and parachute. The camera stabilizes and records until impact with the ground at 5 minutes and 46 seconds. One of the master tandem jumpers on that jump stated that the pilot did not give a briefing on which runway or approach he was going to use. The norm is for the jumpers to avoid crossing runways below 1,000 feet and to stay away about 300 feet from the runways, and the pilot to avoid jumpers at all time. Due to the amount of jumps that are performed per day there is no briefing before each flight. Approaches and runway selection depends on the individual pilot. A representative of the operator stated that only verbal guidance is given to the pilots to follow the FAA rules and it up to their discretion for approaches and runway selection. The acting airport manager stated that there is no agreement for airport operations between the skydive operator and the city, only the lease agreement. The city did develop a voluntary noise abatement procedure outlining areas to avoid. The several pilots at the airport stated that for several years they communicated with the city regarding safety concerns with approaches and runway selection by the skydive operator. They stated the city did not correct the situation.  Probable Cause: The pilot's inadequate visual lookout.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: MIA05LA096 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB MIA05LA096 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  4 April 2019 N24HV Vertical Air Inc 0 DeLand Municipal Airport (KDED/DED), Volusia County, FL unk Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates10-Oct-2022 14:37 ASN Update Bot Added 18-Nov-2024 16:52 The2ndBaron Updated [Total fatalities, Other fatalities, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

On April 25 they left Verkhnyaya Khava and flew to an area 4 km north of the city for another crop spraying mission. The captain did not judge the wind direction adequately, so the airplane attempted to takeoff from the area with a tailwind component. Direction could not be maintained due to the wind. The pilot did not use the brakes to maintain directional control. The airplane did not achieve the speed necessary to lift off (99 km/h). The pilot pulled on the controls, but could not lift the An-2 off the ground. It ran onto a freshly ploughed field and overturned. A fire erupted in the engine but this was quickly contained by the crew with the aid of an onboard fire extinguisher.

On board the aircraft, a DHC-8-103 with registration LN-WIK, were a crew of two pilots and one cabin attendant, 26 passengers and one passive cabin attendant.  During the approach to Hammerfest the crew was informed about variable and occasional gusty wind from south-east. The wind direction favoured runway 23 and the crew planned the landing accordingly. The copilot was Pilot Flying (PF) and the commander was Pilot Not Flying (PNF). The copilot was newly hired and was flying under supervision. The crew was kept updated on the wind conditions by the AFIS operator, and at times the gusty wind conditions favoured runway 05. The copilot left the control to the commander who continued the approach to runway 05. Just before landing the wind direction veered to the right and increased in strength, resulting in a significant tail wind component. This resulted in a marked increase in the descent rate which the commander tried to stop by advancing to full power. However, the altitude was too low and the airplane touched down hard just inside the runway edge on runway 05. At touch down the right main landing gear leg failed. The airplane slid on the belly, right partly retracted main wheel and wing tip for some 650 m, and stopped just after the second (TWY B) turnoff to the apron. The fire and rescue vehicles were quickly at the scene and sprayed foam on the plane to prevent fire. The cabin attendant calmed the passengers who wanted to get out of the plane quickly due to smoke and burned smell in the cabin. It took 33 seconds from the commander's order to evacuate until this was actually initiated. The delay was mainly caused by the fact that the order did not get through the cabinÂs Public Address (PA) system. The investigations show that WiderÃ¸e permitted landings in up to the maximum demonstrated cross wind component of 36 kt and in up to 10 kt tail wind during short field operations.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIBN Report number: AIBN SL 2009/22 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 years and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Aftenposten  WiderÃ¸e   Location  Images: photo (c) AIBN; Hammerfest Airport (HFT); 01 May 2005; (publicdomain) photo (c) AIBN; Hammerfest Airport (HFT); 01 May 2005; (publicdomain) photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Oslo-Gardermoen Airport (OSL/ENGM); 08 August 2004 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The crew ordered 570 litres (about 1000 pounds or 450 kg) of additional fuel and instructed the refueller to put it all into the left wing tank, rather than put half of the ordered amount into each tank, as was company practice. Refuelling was completed at 21:30. Two minutes later the flight taxied out to runway 23R. Takeoff was performed at 21:36. The aircraft climbed to an altitude of FL220 with the autopilot engaged for the climb and cruise. At cruise altitude the climb power remained set for about 15 minutes in order to make up some of the delay caused by the late departure. At about 22:12:28, after power was reduced to a cruise setting and the cruise checks had been completed, the captain noted some fuel imbalance and decided to carry out further fuel balancing. He said, ""WeÂll just open the crossflow again ..sit on left ball and trim it accordingly"". The captain repeated the instruction 5 times in a period of 19 seconds, by telling the first officer to, ""Step on the left pedal, and just trim it to take the pressure off"" and ""Get the ball out to the right as far as you can ..and just trim it"". The first officer sought confirmation of the procedure and said, ""I was being a bit cautious"" to which the captain replied, ""DonÂt be cautious mate, itÂll do it good"". These instructions resulted in the aircraft being flown at a large sideslip angle by the use of the rudder trim control while the autopilot was engaged. Forty-seven seconds after opening the crossflow, the captain said, ""DoesnÂt like that one mate.. youÂd better grab it."" Within one second there was the aural alert ""Bank angle"", followed by a chime tone, probably the selected altitude deviation warning. Both pilots exclaimed surprise. The autopilot had probably disengaged automatically because a servo reached its torque limit, allowing the aircraft to roll and dive abruptly as a result of the applied rudder trim. The crew was unable to recover control from the ensuing spiral dive before airspeed and g limits were grossly exceeded, resulting in the structural failure and in-flight break-up of the aircraft. The flying conditions of a dark night with cloud cover below probably made it more difficult to notice the developing upset at an early stage. The break-up probably started when the aircraft was quite high, perhaps FL199. The wreckage was scattered over a large area of at least two to three square km of rural farmland.

The flight was operated by Transair but conducted on behalf of Aero-Tropics Air Services. Aero-Tropics would provide ground handling, pilot briefing facilities and marketing services. Transair provided the airplane and crew. The Metro 23 aircraft departed Cairns at 08:31. During the descent to Lockhart River on the northbound flight, the crew intended to perform a runway 30 RNAV (GNSS) approach. Late in the approach, the crew appropriately manoeuvred the aircraft to land on runway 12. The engines were shutdown at 09:50. The aircraft departed Lockhart River at 09:58 and arrived at Bamaga at 10:39. The aircraft was refuelled at Bamaga for the return flight to Cairns via Lockhart River to collect two passengers. The pilot in command commented to the ground agent prior to departing Bamaga that the weather was 'bad' at Lockhart River and it may not be possible to land there. The forecast conditions at the aerodrome included a broken10 cloud base 1,000 ft above the aerodrome for periods of up to 60 minutes. The aircraft departed Bamaga at 11:07 and climbed to the cruising altitude of FL170. Descent was commenced at 11:32. Three minutes later the copilot advised Brisbane ATC that the aircraft was on descent, passing 10,000 ft AMSL with an estimated time of arrival at Lockhart River of 11:38. At 11:39 the copilot broadcast on the CTAF (Common Traffic Advisory Frequency) that the crew was conducting the runway 12 RNAV (GNSS) approach, and that the aircraft was at the 'Whisky Golf' (LHRWG) waypoint and tracking for the 'Whisky India' (LHRWI) waypoint. At 11:41 the airplane was over the LHRWI intermediate fix and descent was recommenced at 4.8 NM from the LHRWF waypoint. This was 3.1 NM before the descent point specified on the approach chart for the 3.49 degree constant angle approach path to the missed approach point. After levelling briefly at 3000 feet 18 degrees of flaps were selected. The aircraft then commenced descent 1.4 NM before the final approach fix (FAF). This was 0.3 NM (approximately 7 seconds) after the descent point specified for the constant angle approach path. The average rate of descent was 1000 ft/min, increasing to 1700 ft/min. At 11:43 the Metro was over the FAF at an altitude of 2379 feet. The altitude at this stage should have been 2860 feet. The flight descended then through the segment minimum safe altitude of 2,060 ft. It continued to descend until it flew into the side of a heavily timbered ridge in the Iron Range National Park. The height of the initial impact with trees was 1,210 ft, which was about 90 ft below the crest of the ridge. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS RELATING TO OCCURRENCE EVENTS AND INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS - The crew commenced the Lockhart River Runway 12 RNAV (GNSS) approach, even though the crew were aware that the copilot did not have the appropriate endorsement and had limited experience to conduct this type of instrument approach. - The descent speeds, approach speeds and rate of descent were greater than those specified for the aircraft in the Transair Operations Manual. The speeds and rate of descent also exceeded those appropriate for establishing a stabilised approach. - During the approach, the aircraft descended below the segment minimum safe altitude for the aircraft's position on the approach. - The aircraft's high rate of descent, and the descent below the segment minimum safe altitude, were not detected and/or corrected by the crew before the aircraft collided with terrain. - The accident was almost certainly the result of controlled flight into terrain. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS RELATING TO LOCAL CONDITIONS - The crew probably experienced a very high workload during the approach. - The crew probably lost situational awareness about the aircraft's position along the approach. - The pilot in command had a previous history of conducting RNAV (GNSS) approaches with crew without appropriate endorsements, and operating the aircraft at speeds higher than those specified in the Transair Operations Manual. - The Lockhart River Runway 12 RNAV (GNSS) approach probably created higher pilot workload and reduced position situational awareness for the crew compared with most other instrument approaches. This was due to the lack of distance referencing to the missed approach point throughout the approach, and the longer than optimum final approach segment with three altitude limiting steps. - The copilot had no formal training and limited experience to act effectively as a crew member during a Lockhart River Runway 12 RNAV (GNSS) approach. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS RELATING TO TRANSAIR PROCESSES - Transair's flight crew training program had significant limitations, such as superficial or incomplete ground-based instruction during endorsement training, no formal training for new pilots in the operational use of GPS, no structured training on minimising the risk of controlled flight into terrain, and no structured training in crew resource management and operating effectively in a multi-crew environment. (Safety Issue) - Transair's processes for supervising the standard of flight operations at the Cairns base had significant limitations, such as not using an independent approved check pilot to review operations, reliance on passive measures to detect problems, and no defined processes for selecting and monitoring the performance of the base manager. (Safety Issue) - Transair's standard operating procedures for conducting instrument approaches had significant limitations, such as not providing clear guidance on approach speeds, not providing guidance for when to select aircraft configuration changes during an approach, no clear criteria for a stabilised approach, and no standardised phraseology for challenging safety-critical decisions and actions by other crew members. (Safety Issue) - Transair had not installed a terrain awareness and warning system, such as an enhanced ground proximity warning system, in VH-TFU. - Transair's organisational structure, and the limited responsibilities given to non-management personnel, resulted in high work demands on the chief pilot. It also resulted in a lack of independent evaluation of training and checking, and created disincentives and restricted opportunities within Transair to report safety concerns with management decision making. (Safety Issue) - Transair did not have a structured process for proactively managing safetyrelated risks associated with its flight operations. (Safety Issue) - Transair's chief pilot did not demonstrate a high level of commitment to safety.

The flight was carried out by DC-9-51 N763NC. After takeoff, at some point below 4,000 feet altitude, when the slats were retracted, the MASTER CAUTION light illuminated. The co-pilot, who was pilot flying, observed the RUDDER CONTROL MANUAL annunciator light and then saw that the right hydraulic system pressure was about 1,000 pounds per square inch (PSI). The right engine hydraulic pump switch was selected to 'off' and the flight was continued while the captain referred to the NWA DC-9 Cockpit Operating Manual (COM) to complete the procedures. He also discussed the problem with maintenance control on the ground. The approach and landing at Minneapolis were briefed thoroughly. Approximately 18:50, the captain contacted dispatch to request that they ""call out the trucks"" for their arrival. At 19:01 the captain radioed to MSP center ""ah we got a hydraulic problem, we're gonna go ahead and declare an emergency. ah everything should be okay but just gonna have to land a little faster and we're gonna have the trucks standing and everything."" The landing gear was extended early in the approach because the crew was uncertain if they would have to use the Emergency Gear Extension Handle. This was not necessary as the gear extended successfully. The first officer flew a long slow downwind from Farmington to a downwind leg to runway 22. He turned onto the localizer course at an altitude about 3,000 feet. The flight was then cleared for the approach to runway 22. A safe landing was carried out at 19:23. After landing the flaps were retracted and the After Landing checklist was completed. The crew received taxi instructions, and after crossing runway 30L, he made a right turn onto taxiway A. They made a slight gradual turn into the gate area. He had just started to turn into the gate from taxiway A when the nose wheel steering failed. The first officer then advised Ground Control that they were experiencing steering problems and would probably have to be towed to the gate. He then called MAINT and told them the same thing. Then the captain  lost the brakes. The first officer stated that he saw the captain's hands ""come up"" and apply reverse thrust. The airplane came to a stop. The first officer stated that he called maintenance again and told them that they had lost steering and brakes and that they needed to have the airplane chocked. maintenance asked if they would shut down the engines and the captain said, no, he needed them first officer the reversers. The first officer stressed that they needed to get somebody out there right away; they were in a very precarious situation. maintenance said they would have somebody out as soon as they could. The first officer made a PA announcement to the passengers telling them that the airplane was experiencing a system malfunction; they were going to stay put and then be towed to the gate.
