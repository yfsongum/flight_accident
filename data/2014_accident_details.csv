According to the operator, the captain was the pilot flying and the first officer (FO) was the pilot monitoring. Both pilots indicated that takeoff through the initial descent was uneventful. The aircraft was configured for a flaps 30 landing. During the ILS approach to runway 25L, the captain used the Heads-up Guidance System (HGS) in the IMC mode.  During the decent below 100 feet, the FO indicated that the runway environment was dark and sensed the runway was ""coming close fast"". He noted a slightly increased descent rate and before he could make a callout, the captain had begun to take corrective action.  During the descent, the captain stated he was hand flying the airplane (autopilot and autothrottles were off) and used the localizer, glideslope and flare cues from the HGS. At approximately 30 feet, he transitioned from the HGS to the runway environment, noting it appeared ""pitch black."" He then noticed the runway edge lights and what appeared to be an increased sink rate. Both pilots indicated the airplane touched down firm, then bounced, and the second touch down was harder than the first. Neither were aware that they had struck the tail. The captain did not recall seeing a tail strike warning indication from the HGS. Post flight inspection revealed that the tail strike indicator was compressed and deep scrapes and wear damage to the lower aft fuselage skin. Further investigation revealed multiple fractured frames and buckled stringers, shear ties and straps. The airplane was ferried unpressurized from Las Vegas to Phoenix, AZ (PHX) on January 13 and continued the next day to Seattle-Paine Field, WA. The airplane was repaired and back in service on February 27.

Flight 890 was a domestic service from Imphal to Guwahati and Delhi in India. The aircraft landed at Guwahati at 11:15 UTC and departed for Delhi at 12:05 UTC with 12.7 tonnes of fuel on board. The filed alternates for the sector were Lucknow and Jaipur in that order.  Overhead Lucknow, the crew received the Lucknow weather and when the aircraft was in range the Delhi ATIS weather was also copied. While in contact with Delhi ATC, the flight was advised to join the hold as the runway 28 RVR at Delhi had dropped to the lower end of CAT I operations. At this point runway 29 was below minima. AI890 was number twelve in sequence and continued to remain in the holding pattern for the next 20-25 minutes. During this period there was no attempt on the part of flight crew to seek Lucknow weather. Air India Flight dispatch also did not given any advice to the flight about Jaipur or Lucknow weather. The weather (visibility / RVR) reported on runway 29 was below CAT I conditions so runway was not available for this flight at that moment as the First Officer was only Cat I qualified. The aircraft flew 3 holds before intercepting the localizer runway 28 at 35 miles. RVR runway 28 also dropped below Cat. I minimas, therefore the crew discontinued approach and climbed to 8000 feet on runway heading before going on heading 180. Though the first planned diversion alternate was Lucknow, which had visibility of 2000 m (above minima), the captain elected to divert to Jaipur. Reason was that they were closer to Jaipur and they had inquired about the visibility from Dispatch for Jaipur, which was provided as 2000 m. At this stage the crew did not check complete weather of Jaipur. Minimum diversion fuel to Jaipur was 2.9 tonnes. AI890 commenced diversion to Jaipur with Fuel on Board of 3.1 tonnes.  The aircraft came in contact with Jaipur for the first time when it was at 68 DME from Jaipur. At that time the crew came to know of the complete weather of Jaipur from the ATIS, which read: visibility of 900 m, dew point 13Â°C, temperature 13Â°C, and RVR 1000m. At 60 miles and passing flight level 138, the crew informed Jaipur that the aircraft was descending for flight level 100 as cleared by Delhi control. The aircraft again informed Jaipur ATC its position at 55 miles, 50 miles and 42 miles from Jaipur which were also acknowledged by Jaipur ATC. During these contacts, weather of Jaipur was neither asked by the crew nor provided by ATC. When the aircraft was at flight level 83, the crew asked ATC Jaipur to confirm that they could carry out an ILS approach for runway 27 via the 10 DME arc. While confirming the requested approach, Jaipur ATC informed all the stations about the weather at that moment as visibility 400 m and RVR 1000 m. When the aircraft was at 30 miles from Jaipur, Jaipur ATC passed weather as visibility 400 m, RVR 1000 m and trend visibility becoming 350 m. At 28 DME from Jaipur, the aircraft was maintaining 6000 feet and on request was cleared by Jaipur ATC to descend to 5000 feet. When the aircraft was at 25 DME, from Jaipur, ATC advised that the weather was deteriorating rapidly and visibility was 400 meters. The crew however informed ATC that they were committed to land at Jaipur due to the aircraft fuel state. The fuel on board at that point of time was approx 2.6 tonnes and approach was commenced for Jaipur with a visibility of 500 m with trend reducing. The aircraft was no. 2 in approach at Jaipur and was cleared for the VOR/DME arc ILS approach runway 27 at 25 nm.  Due to reducing visibility, Jaipur ATC asked all the aircraft inbound for Jaipur to come over head and join the JJP hold. The crew of AI890 asked for the weather which was provided as visibility 400 m and RVR 1000 m though RVR deteriorating to 550 m. The flight continued and flew the VOR/DME arc for an ILS runway 27 approach. ATC transmitted the RVR as 200 m and visibility as 50 m with trend reducing. Another scheduled flight ahead of AI890 carried out a missed approach and diverted to Ahmedabad. When the aircraft was above MDA (1480 feet AGL), ATC reported RVR 50 m and cleared the aircraft to land subject to minima. Both the flight crew maintained that they had seen the runway lights. The ILS approach was performed with dual auto pilot until 200ft Radio Altitude. After descending below MDA on auto pilot, the commander disconnected the auto pilot. The captain performed the final approach manually. The aircraft deviated to the left of the runway centre line and touched down on soft ground (in kutcha) on the left hand side of the runway. During touchdown and landing roll, the visibility was zero and crew were unable to see any of the reference cues. The crew had heard rumbling sound during landing roll. The commander stated that he did the manual landing as he was not sure if he could do an auto-land on a ground facility which is CAT I certified airfield in actual zero visibility. The aircraft continued to roll/ skid on the unpaved surface and during this period the left wing impacted trees causing damage to the left wing. Thereafter aircraft turned right and entered the runway finally coming to a halt on the left hand side of runway. There was no fire. The aircraft was disabled on the runway, forcing the following flight (a SpiceJet Boeing 737-800, flight SG256) to carry out a missed approach. That flight was already low on fuel after diverting from Delhi to Jaipur, just like AI890. The captain of SG256 then decided to return to Delhi irrespective of reported visibility and RVR. After diverting to Delhi, the aircraft came in contact with ATC Delhi, declared a MAYDAY due fuel with a request for straight and short vector for ILS 28. During the ILS approach for runway 28, the tower had reported RVR for runway 28 as 375m/900m/50m. A dual channel auto land was carried out.  Fuel remaining at that time was 400 kgs. Fuel remaining during engine shut down was 150 kgs. PROBABLE CAUSE: The cause below has been given considering events as a combination of organizational factors and human error. - The flight crew made an erroneous decision of diverting & continuing to an airfield with reducing visibility. - The flight crew attempted a manual landing in below minima conditions. - Lack of operational supervision and desired ground support to flight. - Internal quality assurance not capturing the hazards which slipped through due complacency - Lack of oversight of the flight operations.METAR: 14:30 UTC / 20:00 local time: VIDP 051430Z 00000KT 0050 R28/0800 R29/0200 FG VV/// 11/11 Q1013 NOSIGDelhi14:30 UTC / 20:00 local time: VIJP 051430Z VRB00KT 0900 R27/1500D MIFG NSC 13/13 Q1014 BECMG 0800Jaipur15:30 UTC / 21:00 local time: VIDP 051530Z 00000KT 0000 R28/0450 R10/0050 R29/0000 R11/0050 FG VV/// 09/09 Q1014 NOSIGDelhi16:00 UTC / 21:30 local time: VIDP 051600Z 00000KT R28/0450 R29/0000 R10/0040 R11/0000 FG VV/// 08/08 Q1014 NOSIGDelhi16:30 UTC / 22:00 local time: VIJP 051630Z 00000KT 0000 R27/0150 FG NSC 13/13 Q1015 NOSIGJaipurAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB India Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Singapore-Changi International Airport (SIN/WSSS); 24 December 2005 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The copilot was fatally injured; the captain and the passenger received serious injuries. The flight originated from the Tucson International Airport (TUS), Arizona, at 10:04 and was bound for Aspen. The departure and en route portions of the flight were uneventful. As the flight neared its destination, a high-altitude, terrain-limited airport, air traffic control (ATC) provided vectors to the localizer/distance measuring equipment (LOC/DME)-E approach to runway 15. About 12:10, the local controller informed the flight crew that the wind was from 290Âº at 19 knots (kts) with gusts to 25 kts. About 12:11, the flight crew reported that they were executing a missed approach and then requested vectors for a second approach. ATC vectored the airplane for a second LOC/DME-E approach to runway 15. About 12:21, the local controller informed the flight crew that the wind was from 330Â° at 16 kts and the 1-minute average wind was from 320Â° at 14 kts gusting to 25 kts. The initial part of the airplane's second approach was as-expected for descent angle, flap setting, and spoilers. During the final minute of flight, the engines were advanced and retarded five times, and the airplane's airspeed varied between 135 kts and 150 kts. The final portion of the approach to the runway was not consistent with a stabilized approach. The airplane stayed nose down during its final descent and initial contact with the runway. The vertical acceleration and pitch parameters were consistent with the airplane pitch oscillating above the runway for a number of seconds before a hard runway contact, a gain in altitude, and a final impact into the runway at about 6 g. The weather at the time of the accident was near or in exceedance of the airplane's maximum tailwind and crosswind components for landing, as published in the airplane flight manual. Given the location of the airplane over the runway when the approach became unstabilized and terrain limitations of Aspen, performance calculations were completed to determine if the airplane could successfully perform a go-around. Assuming the crew had control of the airplane, and that the engines were advanced to the appropriate climb setting, anti-ice was off, and tailwinds were less than a sustained 25 kts, the airplane had the capability to complete a go-around, clearing the local obstacles along that path. Both flight crewmembers had recently completed simulator training for a type rating in the CL-600 airplane. The captain reported that he had a total of 12 to 14 hours of total flight time in the airplane type, including the time he trained in the simulator. The copilot would have had close to the same hours as the captain given that they attended flight training together. Neither flight crew member would have met the minimum flight time requirement of 25 hours to act as pilot-in-command under Part 135. The accident flight was conducted under Part 91, and therefore, the 25 hours requirement did not apply to this portion of their trip. Nevertheless, the additional flight time would have increased the crew's familiarity with the airplane and its limitation and likely improved their decision-making during the unstabilized approach. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The flight crew's failure to maintain airplane control during landing following an unstabilized approach. Contributing to the accident were the flight crew's decision to land with a tailwind above the airplane's operating limitations and their failure not to conduct a go-around when the approach became unstabilized.""METAR: 18:53 UTC / 11:53 local time: KASE 051853Z 31009G28KT 270V360 9SM HZ FEW035 BKN046 OVC050 M11/M20 A3007 RMK AO2 PK WND 33028/1851 SLP243 T11111200 $Wind 310 degrees at 9 knots, gusting to 28 knots; wind variable between 270 and 360 degrees; Visibility: 9 miles in haze; few clouds at 3500 feet AGL, broken clouds at 4600 feet AGL, overcast cloud deck at 5000 feet AGL; Temperature: -11Â°C, Dew point -20Â°C; pressure 30.07 inches Hg.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN14FA099 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Flightaware flight route  LiveATC (audio file of Aspen Tower ATC)  Private jet crashes Aspen Airport; 1 dead, 2 hurt (KABC)  Flightaware accident info  ABC News  NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Aspen-Pitkin County Airport, CO (ASE); January 2014; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Aspen-Pitkin County Airport, CO (ASE); January 2014; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Aspen-Pitkin County Airport, CO (ASE); January 2014; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Aspen-Pitkin County Airport, CO (ASE); January 2014; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

When preparing for landing in MED, the flight crew lowered the landing gear but the right main landing gear did not lower into the extended position. The flight crew notified the MED Air Traffic Control Tower of the discrepancy. The flight crew attempted to use the alternate procedure to lower the right main landing gear without success. The flight crew eventually landed the aircraft with the right main landing gear in the retracted position. The aircraft made a smooth touch down, slowing until the right engine nacelle contacted the runway. The aircraft remained under control during the landing with no injuries to the aircraft occupants. During the evacuation of the aircraft, fourteen passengers received minor injuries and three passengers were seriously injured while sliding down the L-1 slide. Findings 1. A foreign air carrier, the C-11 maintenance check provider, did not identify the number 1 or number 7 brake assemblies having eroded safety wire holes in the lock bolts installed on the brake rod retaining pin when performing a C-11 maintenance check. 2. All lock bolts installed on the brake rod retaining bolts should have been identified and evaluated for serviceability and replaced as necessary. 3. Orient Thai did not identify eroded safety wire holes in the lock bolts during the performance of maintenance activities including, brake replacement tasks, daily checks, and transit checks. 4. The accident was precipitated by the loss of two lock bolts that were not (or were not able to be) safety wired in place. Safety wiring the lock bolts would have prevented the right main landing gear brake rod retaining bolt from loosening and falling away from the pin.Sources: SABQ Online newspaper  AIB-2014-0001   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All four on board were killed. Before departure from Shoreham Airport, U.K, the pilot had called the destination airport, Trier-FÃ¶hren. He was told it would be better to postpone the departure because of thick fog. The departure was not postponed and the Citation jet took off from Shoreham about 10:00 hours. Alternate airfields were Luxembourg and Frankfurt-Hahn. Given the weather conditions the owner of the aircraft expected a diversion, and according to family members did not but pressure on the pilots to land at Trier. The en route and descent part of the flight were uneventful. At 11:45, while descending from FL90 to 5000 feet, the pilot in command contacted air traffic control to cancel their IFR clearance. The controller confirmed this and reported that they were 15 miles northwest of their destination airfield. The airplane was approaching runway 22 and descended until it was flying at a very low altitude, clearing trees by some 15-20 meters, according to eyewitnesses. It pulled up and struck an electricity pylon at a height of about 8 m above the ground. Control was lost and the airplane rolled inverted and crashed. It came to rest inverted on the site of a landfill, located 3,8 km from the threshold of runway 22 and about 700 m to the left of the extended centreline. A fire erupted. The continued descent to the ground likely occurred due to an erroneous selection of the target altitude with 0 ft (sea level) instead of the real aerodrome elevation (666 ft AMSL). Good Crew Resource Management could have brought this error to light but the different personality traits of the two pilots and particularly the captainÂs low appreciation of the co-pilot probably negatively influenced the working relationship in regards to CRM principles.  Weather at Trier about the time of the accident was a visibility of 100-150 m in fog, wind 040Â° at 3-5 knots, temperature -1Â°C, QNH 1020 hPa. Causes The accident was due to the following: - The Pilot in Command (PIC) decided to conduct the VFR approach even though he was aware of the prevailing instrument weather conditions at the airport - It is likely that a wrong vertical profile was flown due to an erroneous selection on the navigation system  - Due to an insufficient situational awareness of the pilots the descent was not aborted in time.

The airplane was destroyed. The pilot and cargo handler suffered fatal injuries. The aircraft took off from Olive Creek at 10:54, carrying fuel and other supplies for gold mining operations. Two and a half minutes after takeoff the engine lost power. The aircraft lost height and impacted an undulating and heavily forested area. Since only three of the seven oil drums were secured, the remaining four shifted forward during the crash. In June 2013 the aircraft received a Blackhawk modification, which consisted among others of the installation of a factory new P&W PT6A-42A engine. CONCLUSIONS: The investigation revealed that the probable cause of the accident was due to a power loss suffered by the engine. The power loss was associated with the fracture of one of the 1st stage compressor stator vanes by fatigue. The fatigue crack originated from a lack of brazing adhesion extending over approximately 0.280 inches along the chord length and 0.050 inches in the direction of the shroud thickness and was located between the leading edge and mid-chord of the vane.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: GCAA-AIT Report number: GCAA: 2/5/1/73 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources: Stabroek News 18-1-2014  CND 19-1-2014  Stabroek News 20-1-2014  AP, 19 Jan 2015   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane originated in Managua, Nicaragua and operated on a non-scheduled cargo flight to Saltillo via Tapachula, Mexico. The flight landed at Tapachula at 00:25 hours local time. An IFR flight plan was then filed for Saltillo, with Monterrey as alternate. It was not taken into account though, that Monterrey's main runway was closed that night as per Notam. The flight departed Tapachula at 01:40. The flight was uneventful up to the approach. The aircraft carried out an ILS/DME approach to runway 17. At 04:05 the flight was cleared to land by the controller. One minute later the pilot reported going around. He stated that they would divert to their alternate, Monterrey Airport. At 04:15 the pilot again contacted the controller at Saltillo, reporting that Monterrey Airport was closed and requesting another approach to runway 17. He radioed: ""We saw runway but ehhh let's do a rough minimum approach or below the minimums"". The airplane continued the approach until it touched down to the right of the centreline and on the last third of the runway. It rolled off the side and the nose gear collapsed. Probable Cause: ""Continuing the precision approach (ILS CAT 1) in conditions of reduced visibility by fog (no visual contact with the runway at an airport below minimums), which resulted in an abrupt landing and misaligned to the right on the last third of the runway, during a second landing attempt, the Commission also determined that what caused the continuation of the landing was the lack of fuel to fly to a second alternate airport not contemplated in the operation"". Contributing factors: 1. Lack of analysis of pre-flight operational information (current NOTAMs, METAR, forecasts, fuel to second alternate airport and flight tracking) 2. Unstabilized approach 3. Lack of application of CRM concepts 4. Lack of adherence to procedure - operations, of providing METAR and NOTAM to the crew for the dispatch of the aircraft. 5. Lack of adherence to the procedure for flight control and tracking 6. Lack of procedures to establish two alternate airports when the destination airport is below minimums. 7.

The accident flight was a commercial ferry flight from Roskilde to Merville, France. After takeoff from runway 11 at Roskilde, the aircraft was established in climb with a nose-up pitch attitude of approximately 13-15Â°. Just before reaching the flap retraction altitude of 400 feet above ground level, the flight crew noticed ""something white"" in front of the aircraft. The commander, who was the pilot flying, immediately initiated an aircraft pitch increase, but almost simultaneously a ""bang"" was heard and a bump was felt in the aircraft, most likely coming from the underside of the aircraft. The flight crew observed large white birds below the aircraft. The flight crew realized that the aircraft had been hit by one or more birds, probably Mute Swans, and decided to leave the flaps at the takeoff setting of 15Â°. Cockpit indications did not show any abnormalities and the aircraft handling and controllability did feel normal by the flight crew. In order to return to Roskilde, the flight crew performed a visual traffic pattern and approach to runway 11, followed by a normal landing and roll-out. The aircraft taxied to the run-up area for runway 29, where an inspection performed by the fire and rescue service personnel revealed that fuel leaked from the left wing. CONCLUSIONS: The accident was caused by a multiple birdstrike.  Up to four Mute Swans damaged the left wing leading edge and the nose radome which resulted in bending of the skin and the stringer structure beneath.  The left wing integral fuel tank structure was damaged resulting in a fuel leak.   Three contributing factors were identified:  1. The lighting condition in combination with the colour of the birds.  2. The small relative movement between the birds and the aircraft.  3.

There were no personal injuries on the 3 crew and 16 passengers on board. Flight F7-250 had departed Leipzig Airport (LEJ), Germany on a scheduled service to Paris-CDG. The copilot was the Pilot Flying (PF) while the captain was Pilot Monitoring (PM). The flight was cleared to perform an ILS approach to runway 27R. The aircraft intercepted the glide slope at 07:25.  The tower controller then cleared the flight to land and reported wind from 200Â° at 12 kt.  The captain again advises the OPL by reminding him when to set up the aircraft for landing. At an altitude of 2,300 ft the landing configuration was set (20Â° flap) and the approach target speed of 123 kt was selected.  At a height of 1000 ft, the approach was stable and the runway was in sight. At a height of about 400 ft, the PF disconnected the autopilot and at 200 ft, the decision height, the crew decided to continue the approach. Passing 50 ft, the PF gradually returned the power levers to the ""flight idle"" position and initiated the flare. Shortly before touchdown the captain pulled on the control column to the maximum nose-up value (11Â°) and the attitude reached a value of 5Â°. The wheels of the main landing gear hit the ground hard, and the airplane was at an indicated speed of about 120 kt. The airplane then bounced. The copilot then pushed the control column forward, causing a nose down attitude. De PM then again pulled on the controls and the aircraft bounced a second time. The PM increased power which was immediately reduced by the PF. The nose landing gear of the aircraft then impacted the runway and collapsed. Conclusion (translated from French): During the flare, the PIC said that the landing was going to be hard. In the emergency, he acted quickly  by pulling on the controls without announcing his intentions to Copilot. This lack of coordination within the crew led to a double piloting and successive and opposite actions on the flight controls during the management of the bounced landing.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Report number: hb-g140128 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: BEA History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  1 February 2001 HB-IZG Crossair 0 ZÃ¼rich-Kloten Airport (ZRH/LSZH) min Fumes/smoke/odor event Location  Images: photo (c) Markus Eigenheer; GenÃ¨ve-Cointrin Airport (GVA/LSGG); 08 November 2013; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Flight GL-3205 originated in Kangerlussuaq, Greenland. Three passengers were taken to the hospital for observation, there were no fatalities or serious injuries. On initial radio contact with Ilulissat AFIS, the flight crew got the information that runway 07 was in use. Weather information showed wind from 150Â° magnetic at 24 knots, maximum 33 knots, minimum 17 knots; a 24 knots cross wind, and a headwind of 5 knots. The wind at threshold runway 25 was gusting to 41 knots. Visibility was fine (10 km) with broken clouds at 12000 feet. The flight crew got visual contact with the Ilulissat area and due to the wind conditions and consequently expected turbulence on final, the flight crew prepared for a NDB/DME approach to runway 07 via JV NDB. Due to the cross wind conditions, the flight crew decided to do a landing with a flap setting of 15Â°.  The flight crew asked Ilulissat AFIS for a confirmation of whether or not the cross winds of 24 knots included the gusting wind conditions up to maximum 33 knots. Ilulissat AFIS replied that the maximum wind was 35 knots and the cross wind was 26 knots.  On a 5 miles final to runway 07, the wind conditions were reported to be 140Â° magnetic at 28 knots with a maximum of 35 knots and a cross wind of 26 knots. On short final to runway 07, the wind conditions were reported to 140Â° magnetic and 25 knots, maximum to 39 knots.  Upon touchdown on runway 07, the left main landing gear collapsed. With the left main landing collapsed and after approximately 104 meters of runway rolling, the flight crew started to loose aircraft directional control. After approximately 389 meters, the aircraft ran off the left side of the runway and into the safety zone. The aircraft skidded sideways, hit the Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) to runway 25, skidded down a steep slope and impacted a rocky area approximately 10 meters below the runway elevation.  The crew members initiated an evacuation of the aircraft. The flight crew found the flight deck door jammed and evacuated the flight deck through the flight compartment emergency exit hatch. The cabin crew member and a passenger had difficulties opening a partly jammed main entrance door. In cooperation with the commander from the outside of the aircraft, they succeeded. From the outside of the aircraft, the commander opened the forward right hand cabin emergency exit door. The passengers and the cabin crew member evacuated the passenger cabin trough the main entrance door. The overall evacuation took approximately 30-40 seconds. Ilulissat Airport has a single, 07/25 asphalt runway, 845 m (2772 ft) long. Runway 07 has a 0,8% downslope for the first 550 m, followed by a 0,2% upslope for 295 m. Conclusion: Adverse crosswind conditions at BGJN led to flight crew target fixation, a flight crew divergence from the operator's stabilized approach parameters and a mental blocking of an appropriate decision on going around.  The flight crew divergence from the operator's stabilized approach parameters induced a non-stabilized approach, which in combination with power levers retarded below flight idle in flight resulted in an accelerated rate of descent leading to a hard landing, with side load on the left main landing gear at touchdown.  The left main landing gear structural fuse pin sheared as a result of lateral and vertical overload stress. Cycling the power levers between ground and flight range prevented an appropriate deceleration of the aircraft and prolonged the landing roll.  The prolonged landing roll combined with the application of full left rudder and no decisive use of reverse thrust on the side with the unaffected main landing gear made it impossible for the flight crew to maintain directional control.  The lack of directional control resulted in the aircraft running off the side of the runway and the safety zone, respectively.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: HCLJ Report number: HCLJ510-2014-258 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Air Greenland   Location  Images: photo (c) AIB Denmark; Ilulissat Airport (JAV); 29 January 2014 photo (c) AIB Denmark; Ilulissat Airport (JAV); 29 January 2014 photo (c) Martin KleinwÃ¤chter; Kulusuk Airport (KUS/BGKK); 08 August 2012 photo (c) Timo Blossfeld; Seattle/Tacoma International Airport, WA (SEA/KSEA); 08 June 2007 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates26-Apr-2024 17:20 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The copilot was at the controls of the airplane while the pilot monitored the airplaneâs systems and prepared for takeoff. During the engine start, one of the two linemen providing ground services to the airplane departed the ramp area leaving one lineman alone, which the operator allowed for normal ground servicing operations. After completing the engine start, the copilot gave the disconnect ground power hand signal to the lineman. The lineman responded with the hold hand signal and then moved to the left and rear of the airplane to disconnect the ground power unit (GPU). The pilot stated that he monitored the airplane's voltmeter to verify that the GPU was disconnected by observing a drop in the voltage current. However, although the drop in voltage could confirm that the GPU was no longer supplying power, it could not confirm that the GPU cable was disconnected. The pilot then looked out the window and realized that the airplane was moving forward. The pilot took the controls, applied the brakes, and set the parking brake. The pilot did not have visual contact with the lineman, so he asked the two crewmembers seated in the cabin to locate him, and one of the crewmembers reported that she saw him standing next to the GPU. The pilot then began to taxi the airplane for departure within the nonmovement area of the ramp; the pilot did not realize that the GPU was still connected to the airplane. As the airplane turned right, the GPU was pulled onto its side, and it then fell onto the linemanâs right leg, which resulted in a serious injury. The pilot stopped the airplane and shut down the engines without further incident. The pilot should have ensured that the GPU was disconnected from the airplane via hand signals from the lineman providing ground services before taxiing the airplane and his failure to do so resulted in the linemanâs injury. Probable Cause: The pilotâs failure to ensure that the ground power unit was disconnected from the airplane via hand signals from the lineman providing ground services before taxiing, which resulted in an injury to the lineman.

The aircraft operated as East Air flight ETJ704 from Moscow's Domodedovo Airport to Kulob. Weather at Kulob was poor due to heavy snowfall. The airport's single runway, 01/19 (3000 m long, 45 m wide), was cleared of snow on the north side. The south side, from the threshold to the middle of the runway, was partly cleared with path of 21 m wide. On both sides of the path a 50-95 cm high snow berm was present. During final approach to runway 01 the pilot in command disconnected the autopilot and switched to manual control of the airplane. The plane landed on runway 01 at a distance of 230 m from the runway threshold, at a speed of 255 km/h. The wheels of the right hand main gear crossed the border the runway at a distance of about 520 m from the threshold and the aircraft continued along the side of the runway. The wheels left main landing gear remained on the runway. At a distance of 710 m from the threshold both engines quit due to ingress of large amounts of snow. The nose landing gear collapsed and the airplane slid until it stopped 1190 m from the beginning of the runway. There was no fire and none of the occupants were injured. CONCLUSION (translation from Russian): The cause of the accident with the aircraft A320-231 EY-623 was the aircraft collision with a snow berm while landing on an unprepared runway, which was cleared by a width of about 22m (runway width being 45m), and where there were snow berms at a height of 50-95cm along the borders. The aircraft's right main gear contacted a snow berm, which led to the destruction of the nose landing gear and self-termination of engines and the aircraft moving off the runway to the right. The accident was the result of a combination of the following factors: - decision by the flight director to receive an aircraft on an unprepared runway; - the unreadiness of the runway at the time of arrival of the aircraft and the failure to make a corresponding entry in the ""Journal of the state of the airfield"" with the runway measures.METAR: 02:00 UTC / 07:00 local time: UTDK 020200Z 26003MPS 0800 SN FZFG VV003 M09/M10 Q1031 0129//60 RMK QBB100 QFE715/0953Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: A320 EY-623 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) Interstate Aviation Committee; Kulob Airport (TJU); 02 February 2014 photo (c) Interstate Aviation Committee; Kulob Airport (TJU); 02 February 2014 photo (c) Interstate Aviation Committee; Kulob Airport (TJU); 02 February 2014 photo (c) Interstate Aviation Committee; Kulob Airport (TJU); 02 February 2014 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane was on an instrument approach to runway 17 at Elk City Airport about 23:00 local time (05:00 UTC) when it impacted a 29-foot tall electric utility pole about 10 feet 7 inches above ground level, located two miles north of the runway. The impact scattered debris from the separated pole for about 200 feet and resulted in substantial damage to the fuselage and horizontal stabilizer. The pilot executed a go-around and diverted to Oklahoma City-Will Rogers Airport, OK (OKC), where it landed without incident about 23:40 local time (05:40 UTC). The pilot reported that he thought he had leveled the airplane at an indicated altitude 2,500 feet msl and at no time during the descent and approach did the airplane's radar altimeter sound an alert indicating that he was below 400 feet agl radar altitude. He also reported that he never saw the terrain, never saw any obstructions, and he never saw the runway lights or airport environment.  An examination of the airplane after landing at OKC showed substantial damage to the nose structure, lower and upper fuselage, and the left side of the horizontal stabilizer. The right side of the radome had impact damage and there was a penetrating impact in the right side of the forward avionics bay. There was also evidence that both engines had ingested foreign objects, but there was not a resulting significant loss of engine power. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The pilot's descent below the published minimum descent altitude for the instrument approach procedure, which resulted in impact with a utility pole.""METAR: UTC / 23:05 local time:wind from 110 degrees at 5 knots, visibility of 2 and 1/2 miles in mist, and overcast clouds at 500 feet agl.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN14LA129 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: FAA  Flightaware   Location  Images: photo (c) FAA; Oklahoma City-Will Rogers Airport, OK (OKC/KOKC); February 2014; (publicdomain) photo (c) FAA; Oklahoma City-Will Rogers Airport, OK (OKC/KOKC); February 2014; (publicdomain) photo (c) FAA; Oklahoma City-Will Rogers Airport, OK (OKC/KOKC); February 2014; (publicdomain) photo (c) FAA; Elk City-Regional Business Airport, OK (ELK); 03 February 2014; (publicdomain) photo (c) Google / FlightAware.com; Elk City-Regional Business Airport, OK (ELK); 03 February 2014; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The captain indicated that, while the airplane was level at about 2,000 ft on the base leg, the flight entered clouds. The first officer stated that she noted moisture on the windshield wiper and the captain indicated that the wind screen was wet. The cockpit voice recorder (CVR) recorded the captain and first officer briefly discussing ice; however, the airplane's ice protection system, which was set to the automatic mode, did not operate automatically, and the crew did not activate the system manually. The crew did not see the ice light come on and there were no icing messages on the engine indicating and crew alerting system. As the first officer was applying control inputs to adjust for a crosswind, a rapid roll to the right occurred, which resulted in a wing strike and substantial damage to the airplane.  About forty minutes after arrival at the gate, an examination of the airplane found an accretion of ice on the leading edge of both wings. The aircraft performance study, which correlated icing charts with the airplane's flight profile, determined that the airplane spent over 20 minutes at altitudes where icing was probable during both approaches. The study concluded that the right roll was not commanded by the flight crew but likely due to ice buildup.  Although the vertical load factor did not indicate that the airplane experienced a full aerodynamic stall, the ice buildup likely created enough flow separation on one wing for it to lose lift during the flare, without affecting the control of the aircraft in a measurable way during the approach.  After the accident, the ice detection and anti-ice systems were tested at the aircraft level with no anomalies identified. The ice detectors were also functionally tested by the manufacturer at the component level with no anomalies identified that could have contributed to the event. A review of FDR data revealed that no failures were recorded for the ice detection system during the accident flight. Additionally, the system operated as expected during a manual preflight test and detected icing conditions during the previous flight. A review of the maintenance records did not reveal any systematic problems with the ice detection system.  Therefore, it could not be determined why the ice detection system did not detect the presence of icing conditions even though the airplane accreted ice during the approach. This possibly could have been due to variations in static air temperature that prevented the ice that accumulated on the sensors from reaching the alert threshold or the occurrence of meteorological conditions out of the 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 25 Appendix C during approach, or a combination of these two factors.Ã¢â¬Â Although the ice detection system did not automatically activate the ice protection system, the CVR recorded a brief discussion during the final approach indicating that the crew was aware that the airplane was picking up 'a little bitÃ¢â¬Â of ice.  According to the Trans States Airlines EMB145 Airplane Operations Manual (AOM) and Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), even though the airplane is equipped with an ice detector, the crew was responsible for monitoring icing conditions and for manual activation of the ice protection system when necessary.  Therefore, the crew recognized that the airplane was operating in icing conditions and accumulating ice and should have manually activated the ice protection system. It is likely the crew's overreliance on automation for the activation and proper operation of the ice and rain protection system resulted in their failure to adequately monitor the system and respond appropriately when it did not activate automatically. Although the AOM and SOPs indicated that the crew is responsible for monitoring icing conditions and for manual activation of the ice protection system when necessary, there was no information in Trans States Airlines ground training modules that presented the crew as being responsible for monitoring and activating the ice and rain protection system when no warnings or cautions were received from the EICAS. Additionally, manual ice detection methods for flight crews to use when flying in potential icing conditions were not specifically referenced during ground training. The Trans States Airlines manager of flight standards said that manual selection of the anti-ice system was not emphasized in training like the automatic mode of operation was during flight operations. It is possible that because the manual operation of the airplane's ice protection system was not emphasized during training, the crew may not have recognized the need to perform this task.  Trans States Airlines issued an operations bulletin after the accident that stated interim procedures for crewmembers to follow when operating in potential in-flight icing conditions. The bulletin called for active monitoring of the deicing/anti-icing equipment and, if it did not activate, to accomplish the QRH's Ice Detectors Fail procedures.   Probable Cause: the failure of the flight crew to adequately monitor the system for proper operation and manually activate the system during the flight in icing conditions. Contributing to the accident was the crew's limited training on the manual operation of the anti-ice system and the nonactivation of the automatic ice detection system for reasons that could not be determined.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA14FA058 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 7 years Download report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA14FA058  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates06-Oct-2022 18:08 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

The damage were found after the training flight was completed.  The crew were uninjured.  Japan Transport Safety Board says the trainee probably changed from a crab approach to a wing-low attitude to counter the crosswind, and that the aircraft initially contacted the runway with its right-hand main gear. The Dash 8 bounced and pitched up slightly, says the inquiry, and the trainee pushed on the control column â a decision which âabruptlyâ caused the aircraft to pitch to 4.57Â° nose-down. JTSB says the trainee had thought the nose of the turboprop was âtaking longerâ to lower than it should have. He had also been influenced by the captainâs observations that he tended to pitch the nose too high while switching from crabbing to a wing-low attitude, and that he also needed to push harder on the control column to maintain direction during take-off. JTSB says the recorded impact was 2.016g, and this caused the shock strut brace of the nose-gear to contact the runway surface. It is probable that the accident occurred while the aircraft was landing under strong crosswind, under the condition that the main landing gear grounded without sufficient load being applied, the nose of the airplane downed excessively and the nose landing gear grounded heavily, which caused damage on the nose landing gear and the deformation of the right and left fuselage skins. As for the nose landing gear of the aircraft grounding heavily, it is probable that the trainee continuously downed the nose, and subsequently the captain who was the instructor failed to provided an appropriate corrective operation.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JTSB Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: http://jtsb.mlit.go.jp/jtsb/aircraft/detail.php?id=2082  [LINK NOT WORKING ANYMORE:http://www.nhk.or.jp/lnews/nagasaki/5035213083.html?t=1392294916081]  http://www.orc-air.co.jp/db_img/news_img/272/c20140213123519343.pdf  http://www.mlit.go.jp/jtsb/eng-air_report/JA801B.pdf History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  8 March 2017 JA801B Oriental Air Bridge 0 over Sasebo city, Nagasaki prefecture unk 27 September 2017 JA801B Oriental Air Bridge 0 Nagasaki prefecture unk Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates13-Feb-2014 13:10 isamuel Added 25-May-2016 14:01 Aerossurance Updated [Time, Source, Narrative, ]03-Jul-2023 09:27 harro Updated Corrections or additions? ...

All 18 on board sustained fatal injuries. Flight RA183 was a domestic flight from Kathmandu to Jumla with a refueling stop at Pokhara. The airplane took off from Pokhara at 12:43. Upon leaving Pokhara Control Zone, the pilot in command realized that the direct track was not possible due weather and decided to proceed via a more southern track. During the flight the pilots were experiencing uncomfortable flying environment due to unfavorable weather conditions. Attempting to avoid the weather, the pilots had to fly up and down and changing the heading. Finally being unable to penetrate the weather ahead, the captain decided to divert to Bhairahawa, the nearest airport. However, the captain did not take into consideration the surrounding terrain and continued descent turning right.  The aircraft initially slashed a small tree and finally impacted a ridge. Due to the heavy impact the left wing was first disintegrated and then the front part of the aircraft toppled over beyond the ridge with several subsequent impacts. The cockpit voice recorder showed that the copilot had warned the captain not to descend or turn. The wreckage was located the following morning at an altitude of 7190 feet (2192 m). There were no surivors. Causes: After detail investigation and thorough analysis of the circumstances and evidences, the Commission has determined that the most probable causes of the accident is the  ""Losing situational awareness on the part of PIC while flying into instrument meteorological weather condition to the extent of Collision with terrain."" The contributing factors to the occurrence are; - Deteriorated weather associated with western disturbance, unstable in nature and embedded CB. - Inappropriate and insufficient crew coordination while changing course of action.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Nepal AAIC Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: ekantipur.com  Nepali Times  Hemant Arjyal  SKYbraryÂ  History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  5 July 1992 9N-ABB Royal Nepal Airlines 0 Jumla Airport (JUM) sub Location  Images: photo (c) Krish Dulal; near Sandhikhark; 17 February 2014; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Kathmandu-Tribhuvan Airport (KTM/VNKT); 27 October 2011 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Approximately 3 hours and 30 minutes after blocks on, the aircraft was struck on the aft right fuselage by a Hi-Loader catering truck. The force of the collision caused the aircraft nose wheel to turn about its axis for approximately 30 degrees and the nose of the aircraft was deflected approximately four meters to the right of the parking bay centreline.

As result of the sudden movement of the aircraft the crewmember fell through the gap from a height of approximately 3 meters onto the tarmac.  The crewmember sustained serious injury and was transported to the hospital.  Causes The Air Accident Investigation Sector determines that the causes of the Accident were: 3.3.1 The catering vehicle driver was not aware that the vehicle was approaching the Aircraft at excessive speed; and 3.3.2 The performance of the driver was degraded, most probably, due to tiredness or distraction.

Of the 120 passengers and crew onboard, two flight attendants were seriously injured, and one FA and nine passengers received minor injuries. The airplane was not damaged. The flight was operating under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 as a regularly scheduled passenger flight from Denver International Airport (DEN), Denver, Colorado, to Billings Logan International Airport (BIL), Billings, Montana. The flight departed DEN normally and climbed to a cruising altitude of flight level (FL) 380. The flight encountered light turbulence and the crew requested, and was granted, a descent to FL360 followed by a descent to FL340. The flight crew extinguished the seat belt sign when the ride smoothed out. Flight data recorder (FDR) data indicated the airplane was cruising about FL340 when it encountered an area of severe turbulence for about 55 seconds. The most severe turbulence occurred for about 10 seconds when the vertical acceleration fluctuated between about -1.23 g's and +2.05 g's, the lateral acceleration fluctuated between about -0.27 g's and +0.23 g's, the pitch fluctuated between about +5.8Â° (nose up) and -1.8Â° (nose down), and the roll fluctuated between about 14Â° left and 20Â° right. At the time of the turbulence encounter, the two flight attendants (FA) in the forward galley and the one FA in the aft galley were injured. during the turbulence encounter and suffered. The aft FA was unconscious after the event and tended to by medical personnel passengers until landing. After being notified of the serious injuries, the flight crew declared an emergency with air traffic control and arranged for medical personnel to meet the aircraft at BIL. The three FAs were transported to the hospital. One FA was diagnosed with a fractured fibula; one was diagnosed with fractures of her scapula, a rib, cervical vertebrae, and thoracic vertebrae; and one was treated and released with minor injuries. According to the NTSB weather study, an Airman's Meteorological Information (AIRMET) for moderate turbulence for altitudes between FL270 and FL390 was issued at 0745 MST for a region that included the accident location. The flight dispatch release for the accident aircraft, which included weather information, included a Flight Planning Guidance product from WSI that advised of light/occasional moderate mountain wave activity between FL310 and FL390 close to where the accident occurred. Probable Cause: an encounter with severe mountain wave turbulence during cruise flight.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA14LA060 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  https://flightaware.com/live/flight/UAL1676/history/20140217/1815Z/KDEN/KBIL  NTSB File DCA14LA060 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  14 March 2016 N23708 United Airlines 0 Port Arthur, Texas non Turbulence Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates19-Feb-2014 10:10 whiteshark Added 19-Feb-2014 10:11 harro Updated [Location, Narrative, ]19-Feb-2014 17:19 Geno Updated [Time, Other fatalities, Location, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, ]19-Feb-2014 17:22 Geno Updated [Source, ]20-Feb-2014 06:20 Whiteshark Updated [Time, Narrative, ]03-Mar-2014 16:31 Geno Updated [Time, Phase, Source, Narrative, ]21-Dec-2016 19:28 ASN Update Bot Updated [Time, Damage, Category, Investigating agency, ]03-May-2020 18:58 ASN Update Bot Updated [Time, Operator, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, Accident report, ]05-May-2021 07:25 goldfish85 Updated [Location, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, ]09-May-2021 14:26 harro Updated [Total occupants, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The captain was Pilot Flying (PF). The en route part and descent towards Funchal (FNC), Madeira, were uneventful. There was a partially cloudy sky at Funchal with good visibility, surface wind was strong from 330Â° at 14 kts gusting to 24 kts, with variations in direction between 220Â° and 020Â°. Temperature was 15Â°C.  The commander reported that the visual approach to runway 05 seemed normal until the point Rosario, when he began to notice effects of ""wind shear"" and coincident with the automatic altitude call of 50 feet, the aircraft developed a high sink rate. The PF continued with the approach and he attempted to arrest the rate of descent but the aircraft landed heavily and bounced to a height of about 8 feet and continued for about 300 meters. During the second contact with the runway, the tail of the aircraft struck its surface at a speed of about 140 kts. The PF was able to control the aircraft safely within the confines of the runway. A preliminary visual inspection showed some deformation of the outer surface of the fuselage and significant skid marks on the underside of the rear fuselage. Closer inspection, performed by maintenance services, revealed the existence of a deformed drain tube, some bent struts with five cracks found on two fuselage frames that had suffered structural damage from the vertical loads sustained in the contact with the runway. CAUSE:  The accident was due to an excessive nose up input after the first contact with the runway and at a time in which the aircraft was airborne at around 8 feet (RA) which, associated to the manual deployment of the speedbrakes and consequent loss of lift, resulted in a sharp nose up attitude (9.15Â°) to a point of causing the tail strike with the runway surface. Contributing factors: 1. The Normal Checklist (Landing) was not executed (737-800 FCOM Chapter NP); 2. The aircraft approach was conducted under turbulence conditions in the last 150 feet; 3. Aircraft deviation from the ""stabilized approach"" profile which implied the execution of a go-around (737 NG FCTM Chapter 5); 4.

A steeper-than-usual climb was carried out to reduce exposure to turbulence. However, other than the expected turbulence during the first 1,500 ft, there was nothing significant during the climb to FL170. During cruise, the crew conducted a routine brief for the anticipated arrival to runway 16R, which was expected to be standard except for commencement of descent 5 NM (9 km) earlier than normal to compensate for a tailwind. The captain noted the need to be cognizant of managing airspeed during the descent as the anticipated decreasing tailwind would result in a temporary increase in the indicated airspeed. The first officer commenced descent into Sydney with the autopilot engaged in vertical speed mode and a target airspeed of 235 kt (15 kt less than the maximum operating speed of 250 kt). The descent was reported to have been initially stable and smooth. On first contact with Sydney Approach the crew were assigned runway 16L. This was different to the expected runway and required the crew to re-brief the approach and change the instrument approach diagrams and navigational aid frequencies. Passing 8,500 ft above mean sea level (AMSL), the crew noticed a rapid airspeed increase. The first officer reported that the airspeed trend indicator was 'off the chart', indicating a very rapid increase in airspeed. The first officer reduced engine power and used touch control steering to temporarily disconnect the autopilot before manually raising the aircraft's nose to control the speed. The first officer expected that, in combination, the pitch correction and power reduction would be sufficient to arrest the speed trend. The first officer reported that the aircraft felt 'heavy', as was normal for this aircraft at that speed, requiring two hands on the controls to move from the then -4Â° pitch angle.  The captain reported being unsure if the first officer's control inputs would be sufficient to avoid exceeding the maximum operating speed limitation, so put one of his hands on the controls and disconnected the autopilot to raise the nose further. Shortly after, with both flight crew making simultaneous nose up pitch inputs on the controls, the aircraft rapidly pitched up with an associated increase in the g load. The first officer responded by immediately reversing the control input to nose down. Both flight crew noticed that the controls suddenly felt different and 'spongy'. At about the same time, aural and visual cockpit warnings activated. The crew verified that the aircraft was under control at a stable attitude and speed, observing that it was level or in a slight descent at an airspeed of about 230 kt. One of the cockpit warnings was 'pitch disconnect', indicating that the left and right elevator control systems had uncoupled from each other. This allowed for independent movement of the left and right elevators via the captain's and first officer's control columns respectively. The crew consulted the pitch disconnect checklist and worked to identify which control column was free and working normally. After determining that both controls were free, it was decided that the captain would be pilot flying for the remainder of the approach and landing at Sydney Airport. The aerodynamic loads generated during the pitch disconnect resulted in serious injury to the senior cabin crew member and significant damage to the aircraft's horizontal stabiliser.  = Inspection = Two maintenance engineers were tasked to inspect the aircraft after landing. A readout of the aircraft systems computer revealed a maximum vertical load factor of 3.34 g at 16:41 hours. This load factor was abnormally high and prompted one of the engineers to discuss it with the crew, who were surprised about the high value. The crew added Âassociated with moderate turbulenceÂ to the maintenance log entry. Since this g-value was outside of the acceptable limits for the aircraft weight, the engineer he grounded the aircraft.   The applicable maintenance was determined to be the 'Inspection after flight in turbulence and/or exceeding VMO'. That evening a visual inspection was conducted of the wing, using an elevated platform. The engineer also used a torch to inspect the rear fuselage and tail. However, no high-access platform was available, so no close visual inspection was performed on the horizontal stabilizer.  Other maintenance was carried out the next morning, which consisted of among others an operational test of the pitch uncoupling mechanism re-engagement system. The aircraft was then released for service on 13:30 the day after the accident. Subsequent to the post-occurrence maintenance completed on 21 February 2014, the aircraft was operated on a further 13 flights. The respective flight crews did not record any anomalies or defects during their pre-flight inspections and there were no reports of any abnormal aircraft handling characteristics. = Feb 25 incident = On 25 February, aircraft VH-FVR was operated on a scheduled passenger flight from Sydney to Albury, NSW. On descent into Albury, the aircraft passed in close proximity to birds, which alerted the captain to the possibility of a birdstrike on the left side of the aircraft. There were no in-flight indications that a bird had struck the aircraft but after landing, the captain noticed the aircraftÂs pitch trim system fluctuated abnormally. The captain conducted a walk-around inspection and, although there was no evidence of a birdstrike on the left of the aircraft, he identified a dent in the top leading edge of the vertical stabiliser. The captain advised the operatorÂs maintenance watch who dispatched an engineer to Albury to inspect the aircraft. The engineer used scissor lift equipment to gain access to, and inspect the stabiliser. He did not find any evidence of a birdstrike, such as blood or feathers. However, the engineer did find indications of significant structural damage to the horizontal stabiliser, and contacted maintenance watch to cancel the following flights. Upon further examination and discussion with the airline, it became evident that the damage found at Albury was probably a consequence of the occurrence on 20 February. Findings: From the evidence available, the following findings are made regarding the in-flight upset and inadvertent pitch disconnect involving ATR 72 aircraft, VH-FVR on 20 February 2014 resulting in cabin crew injury and serious aircraft damage. A post-event maintenance inspection was carried out but the aircraft damage was not detected. Consequently, the aircraft was operated for another 13 flights over 5 days before the damage was identified. Contributing factors: - During the descent, when the sterile flight deck policy was applicable, the flight crew engaged in non-pertinent conversation. This distracted the crew and probably reduced their ability to monitor and respond to fluctuations of airspeed. - While passing through about 8,500 ft on descent into Sydney, the aircraft encountered a significant windshear that resulted in a rapidly decreasing tailwind. This led to a rapid increase in the airspeed, with the airspeed trend vector likely indicating well above the maximum operating speed (VMO). - Although the first officer (pilot flying) was in the process of attempting to control the airspeed, in response to the unexpectedly high airspeed trend indication, and their proximity to VMO, the captain (pilot not flying) perceived a need to immediately intervene, and made pitch control inputs before following the normal take-over procedure and alerting the first officer. - The addition of the captainÂs and first officerÂs nose-up control inputs resulted in a pitching manoeuvre that exceeded the limit load factor for the aircraft of 2.5 g. - The magnitude of the captain's nose-up control input was probably greater than he intended, due to his response to a high stress level, but increased the probability that the aircraft's limit load factor would be exceeded. - Shortly after the captain initiated the nose-up control inputs, the first officer reversed his control input. The differential forces in the left (captain) and right (first officer) pitch control systems were sufficiently large to inadvertently activate the pitch uncoupling mechanism, disconnecting the left and right pitch control systems. - Given the high airspeed, the asymmetric elevator deflections that occurred immediately following the pitch disconnect event resulted in aerodynamic loads on the tailplane that exceeded its strength and damaged the horizontal stabiliser. - The design of the ATR 72 pitch control system resulted in limited tactile feedback between the left and right control columns, reducing the ability of one pilot to detect that the other pilot is making control inputs. In addition, there were no visual or auditory systems to indicate dual control inputs.

The captain was Pilot Flying.  The en route part of the first leg was uneventful. Runway in use at Terceira-Lajes Airport was runway 15. There was a partially cloudy sky, good visibility, a strong surface wind from southwest (190Â° at 22 kts gusting to 32 kts), with direction variations between 160Â° and 230Â° and the air temperature was 15Â°C.  The commander reported that the visual approach to runway 15 seemed normal until 5 NM from touchdown. Winds were registered at a speed of up to 50 kts and there was severe turbulence along the entire approach.  Below 1000 feet the crew noticed effects of down-drafts and up-drafts, with huge variations in intensity until short final. The captain stated that he opted to maintain an angle of descent (G/S) above the recommended, due to severe turbulence and to ensure a safety margin. The entire approach was flown with Auto Thrust connected, for effective and accurate speed control.  The aircraft developed a high sink rate and lost speed instantly. This was counteracted by the captain with increasing power and attitude, in an attempt to stabilize the sink-rate. Touchdown occurred with a high rate of descent and a short flare, resulting in an impact on the main landing gear of 3.52 G vertical acceleration, followed by a bounce. A forward push of the control column by the pilot flying resulted in a pitch-down attitude of -1.9Â° with a second impact of 2.75 G vertical acceleration over the nose wheel causing substantial damage in that area of the aircraft fuselage. An inspection revealed the existence of some folded braces in the interior structure of the nose wheel bay with some bent struts, cracks found in fuselage frames that had suffered structural damage from the vertical loads applied in the contact with the runway. CAUSES:  1. Procedural The flight crew did not comply with aircraft manufacturer procedures and company SOPs, which required a ""go around"" manoeuvre; 2. Actuation The accident was due to an excessive control column forward input, causing aircraft negative pitch attitude which led to a very high impact loading on the nose undercarriage, leading to the severe damage of braces in the interior structure of the nose wheel bay, struts and fuselage frames. This followed a chain of events, which contributed to the accident including the wind gusts, turbulence, decision to fly above ILS G/P, the use of the A/T without A/P and the decision to land from an unstabilized final approach. The following were considered as contributing factors: 1. The aircraft approach was conducted under turbulent conditions; 2. The PF established an approach profile of one dot of scale above the nominal ILS G/S; 3. The PF did not disconnect the A/T after disengagement of the A/P; 4. Deviation from aircraft ""stabilized approach"" profile; 5. The PM did not provide the required call outs for the ""stabilized approach"" deviations.METAR: 07:00 UTC / 06:00 local time: LPLA 220700Z 19022G32KT 160V230 9999 FEW008 BKN012 14/13 Q1013=08:00 UTC / 07:00 local time: LPLA 220800Z 20018G28KT 9999 VCSH FEW008 BKN011 15/14 Q1011=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: GPIAA Report number: 04/ACCID/2014 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were 227 passengers and 12 crew members on board. The Boeing 777-2H6ER took off from Kuala Lumpur International Airport's runway 32R at 00:41. At 00:42 the flight was cleared to climb to FL180 and was issued a direct track by Lumpur Approach to the IGARI waypoint. MH370 was then transferred to Lumpur Radar and was cleared to climb to FL250. At 00:50 the flight was further cleared to the planned cruising altitude of FL350. MH370 reported maintaining FL350 at 01:07. Last radio contact was at 01:19 when the Kuala Lumpur Radar controller instructed the flight to contact the radio frequency of Ho Chi Minh Air Traffic Control Centre, Vietnam: ""Malaysian Three Seven Zero contact Ho Chi Minh 120 decimal 9 Good Night"". One of the flight crew members replied: ""Good night, Malaysian Three Seven Zero.""  At 01:21 MH370 was observed on the radar screen of the Kuala Lumpur Radar controller as it passed over waypoint IGARI. Nine seconds later the radar label for MH370 disappeared from the radar screen. The transponder was switched off.  At 01:38 Ho Chi Minh ATCC contacted Kuala Lumpur ATCC on the whereabouts of MH370. Kuala Lumpur ATCC contacted the airline's operations centre, Singapore ACC, Hong Kong ACC, and Phnom Penh ACC, failing to establish the location of MH370. Meanwhile, the airplane flew in a westerly direction back over peninsular Malaysia before turning northwest. Primary radar data showed that the aircraft tracked along the Malacca Strait. During this time the aircraft passed close to waypoints VAMPI, MEKAR, NILAM and possibly IGOGU along a section of airway N571. The final primary radar fix occurred at 02:22. From then on seven handshakes between the aircraft's SATCOM system and the Inmarsat ground station were recorded. Last satellite data was recorded at 08:11 Malaysian time. Initially search efforts focused on the South China Sea area. On 24 March 2014 further analysis of the Inmarsat satellite data indicated that MH370 flew south and ended its flight in the southern part of the Indian Ocean.  A surface search was conducted of probable impact areas along an arc, identified by calculations based on Inmarsat data. The search was carried out from 18 March - 28 April 2014. This search effort was undertaken by an international fleet of aircraft and ships with the search areas over this time progressing generally from an initial southwest location along the arc in a north-easterly direction. No debris associated with MH370 was identified either from the surface search, acoustic search or from the ocean floor search in the vicinity of acoustic detections, which were initially believed to have been from the pingers on the flight recorders. The ocean floor search was completed on 28 May 2014. On June 26 the ATSB published a new search area based on refinements to the analysis of both the flight and satellite data. The priority area of approximately 60,000 km2 extends along the arc for 650 km in a northeast direction from Broken Ridge, an underwater ridge. The width of the priority search area is 93 km. On July 29, 2015 a flapperon washed ashore on the French island of RÃ©union in the Indian Ocean. On August 5 it was established to have been from MH370. The Team is unable to determine the real cause for the disappearance of MH370.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MH370 Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 years and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: mh370search.com  DCA Malaysia  ATC Transcript  Malaysia Airlines History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  9 August 2012 9M-MRO Malaysia Airlines 0 Shanghai-Pudong International Airport (PVG/ZSPD) sub Location  Images: photo (c) ATSB; 20 July 2016 photo (c) ATSB photo (c) ATSB photo (c) ATSB photo (c) ATSB photo (c) ATSB photo (c) Mark Ijsseldijk; Tokyo-Narita Airport (NRT/RJAA); 25 August 2010 photo (c) Stanley Page; Frankfurt International Airport (FRA/EDDF); 28 September 2013 photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Newark-Liberty International Airport, NJ (EWR/KEWR); January 2004 photo (c) Stemoc; Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG/LFPG); 26 December 2011 photo (c) Ahmet Akin Diler; Istanbul-AtatÃ¼rk International Airport (IST/LTBA); 02 December 2009 photo (c) Joao Ponces; Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KUL/WMKK); 04 April 2013 photo (c) Paul Rowbotham; Los Angeles International Airport, CA (LAX/KLAX); October 2013 photo (c) Willem GÃ¶ebel; Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS/EHAM); 03 February 2013 photo (c) Wolfgang Bergemann; Tokyo-Narita Airport (NRT/RJAA); 11 December 2006 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates04-Jan-2025 11:16 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Before pushback from the gate, the first officer, who was the pilot monitoring, initialized the flight management computer (FMC) and mistakenly entered the incorrect departure runway (27R instead of the assigned 27L). As the captain taxied onto runway 27L for departure, he noticed that the wrong runway was entered in the FMC. The captain asked the first officer to correct the runway entry in the FMC, which she completed about 27 seconds before the beginning of the takeoff roll; however, she did not enter the FLEX temperature (a reduced takeoff thrust setting) for the newly entered runway or upload the related V-speeds. As a result, the FMC's ability to execute a FLEX power takeoff was invalidated, and V-speeds did not appear on the primary flight display (PFD) or the multipurpose control display unit during the takeoff roll.  Once the airplane was cleared for takeoff on runway 27L, the captain set FLEX thrust with the thrust levers, and he felt that the performance and acceleration of the airplane on the takeoff roll was normal. About 2 seconds later, as the airplane reached about 56 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS), the flight crew received a single level two caution chime and an electronic centralized aircraft monitoring (ECAM) message indicating that the thrust was not set correctly. The first officer called ""engine thrust levers not set."" According to the operator's pilot handbook, in response to an ""engine thrust levers not set"" ECAM message, the thrust levers should be moved to the takeoff/go-around (TO/GA) detent. However, the captain responded by saying ""they're set"" and moving the thrust levers from the FLEX position to the CL (climb) detent then back to the FLEX position. As the airplane continued to accelerate, the first officer did not make a callout at 80 KIAS, as required. As the airplane reached 86 KIAS, the automated RETARD aural alert sounded and continued until the end of the CVR recording. According to Airbus, the RETARD alert is designed to occur at 20 ft radio altitude on landing and advise the pilot to reduce the thrust levers to idle. The captain later reported that he had never heard an aural RETARD alert on takeoff, only knew of it on landing, and did not know what it was telling him. He further said that when the RETARD aural alert sounded, he did not plan to reject the takeoff because they were in a high-speed regime, they had no red warning lights, and there was nothing to suggest that the takeoff should be rejected.  The first officer later reported that there were no V-speeds depicted on the PFD and, thus, she could not call V1 or VR during the takeoff. She was not aware of any guidance or procedure that recommended rejecting or continuing a takeoff when there were no V-speeds displayed. The captain stated that he had recalled the V-speeds as previously briefed from the Taxi checklist, which happened to be the same V-speeds for runway 27L. The captain continued the takeoff roll despite the lack of displayed V-speeds, no callouts from the first officer, and the continued and repeated RETARD aural alert.  The airplane rotated at 164 KIAS. The captain had ""the perception the aircraft was unsafe to fly"" and that he decided ""the safest action was not to continue,"" so he commenced a rejected takeoff. FDR data indicate that the captain reduced the engines to idle and made an airplane-nose-down input as the airplane reached 167 KIAS (well above the V1 speed of 157 KIAS) and achieved a 6.7 degree nose-high attitude. The airplane's pitch decreased until the nosegear contacted the runway. However, the airplane then bounced back into the air and achieved a radio altitude of about 15 ft. The tail of the airplane then struck the runway surface, followed by the main landing gear then the nose landing gear, resulting in its fracture. The airplane slid to its final resting position on the left side of runway 27L. The operator's SOPs address the conditions under which a rejected takeoff should be performed within both low-speed (below 80 KIAS) and high-speed (between 80 KIAS and V1) regimes but provide no guidance for rejecting a takeoff after V1 and rotation. Simulator testing performed after the accident demonstrated that increasing the thrust levers to the TO/GA detent, as required by SOPs upon the activation of the ""thrust not set"" ECAM message, would have silenced the RETARD aural alert.  At the time of the accident, neither the operator's training program nor manuals provided to flight crews specifically addressed what to do in the event the RETARD alert occurred during takeoff; although, 9 months before the accident, US Airways published a safety article regarding the conditions under which the alert would activate during takeoff. The operator's postaccident actions include a policy change (published via bulletin) to its pilot handbook specifying that moving the thrust levers to the TO/GA detent will cancel the RETARD aural alert. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The captain's decision to reject the takeoff after the airplane had rotated. Contributing to the accident was the flight crew's failure to follow standard operating procedures by not verifying that the airplane's flight management computer was properly configured for takeoff and the captain's failure to perform the correct action in response to the electronic centralized aircraft monitoring alert.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA14MA081 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Flightglobal  CNN  FAA  BEA   Location  Images: photo (c) Rafal Szczypek; Philadelphia International Airport, PA (PHL/KPHL); 28 February 2016 photo (c) Colin Pierce; Philadelphia International Airport, PA (PHL/KPHL); 03 June 2018 photo (c) Jack Goldberg; Philadelphia International Airport, PA (PHL/KPHL); 04 August 2018 photo (c) Paul Kanagie; Philadelphia International Airport, PA (PHL/KPHL); 23 January 2021 photo (c) Paul Kanagie; Philadelphia International Airport, PA (PHL/KPHL); 23 January 2021 photo (c) NTSB; 2014; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; 2014; (publicdomain) photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Washington-Ronald Reagan National Airport, DC (DCA/KDCA); 17 October 2012 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The 2 pilots were not injured. The flight originated at Opa-locka, Florida (OPF), about 09:52. The two flight crewmembers reported that, after landing on runway 36, the pilot, who was the pilot flying, applied the brakes normally; however, the airplane did not decelerate as expected. The pilot applied the brakes a second time, and the right main landing gear tire subsequently failed. The airplane departed the end of runway 36 and came to rest in an area of unfinished gravel, which resulted in structural damage to the airframe.  Examination of the 4,954-feet-long runway revealed that the airplane touched down about 1,400 feet from the approach end. Skid marks were visible for about 2,982 feet, and the tire failure occurred about 3,153 feet into the landing. Examinations revealed that the right main landing gear tire had a flat spot with a 4-inch diameter hole consistent with a locked brake. The airplane was equipped with an optional antiskid wheel braking system; however, it was disabled in 2004. The pilots reported that they decided to land on runway 36 based on the wind at flight level 180 and that they did not check the surface wind at the airport. The surface wind at the airport at the time of the accident was from 158 degrees at 15 knots gusting to 25 knots. Thus, the airplane landed with a significant quartering tailwind, which resulted in it touching down at a location and speed at which the pilots were unable to stop the airplane on the runway using normal braking. The pilots' inadequate in-flight planning and improper selection of runway 36 for landing, which resulted in a significant quartering tailwind during the landing, exceedance of the airplane's braking capability, and a subsequent runway overrun.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA14LA159 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All ten occupants survived the accident. The aircraft was used to fly the Governor of Haryana from Chandigarh to Delhi. In addition to the pilot and co-pilot there were 8 passengers. The baggage on board was approx. 50 lbs. There was 2100 lbs. of fuel on board. After boarding of the passengers, the aircraft engines were started at 11:30 hrs. The aircraft taxied out via taxiway D. After ATC departure clearance the aircraft was lined up for take-off. On clearance from ATC the take off roll was initiated and all the parameters were found normal. The rotation was initiated at 98 knots and the aircraft climbed to 10-15 feet AGL. The commander has stated that after lift-off, immediately the left rudder got locked in the forward position resulting in the aircraft yawing and rolling to left. The pilots tried to control it with right bank but the aircraft could not be controlled. Within 3-4 seconds of getting airborne the aircraft impacted the ground in a left bank attitude. The initial impact was on pucca (tar road) and the wing took the first impact loads. After the aircraft came to final halt, the co-pilot opened the door and evacuation was carried out. There was no injury to any of the occupants. Probable cause of the accident: The accident occurred due to stalling of left wing of the aircraft at a very low height. The contributory factors were: - Failure on the part of the crew to effectively put off the yaw damp so as to release the rudder stiffness as per the emergency checklist. - Checklist not being carried out by the crew members. - Not putting off the Rudder Boost. - Speeds call outs not made by co-pilot. - Not abandoning the take-off at lower speed (before V1). - Failure of CRM in the cockpit in case of emergency. - Early rotation and haste to take-off.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB India Report number: 2014-ACC-0 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) Ashishbhatnagar72; Delhi-Safdarjung Airport (/VIDD) [VT]; 30 January 2012; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Flight OC 6393 was a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Petrolina to BrasÃ­lia. While en route, thirty minutes after takeoff, the no.1 hydraulic system showed a loss in pressure. During the approach to BrasÃ­lia, the flight crew used the alternative system for lowering the undercarriage. The main landing gears lowered and locked, but the nose landing gear did not lower. After coordination with the air traffic control, the aircraft was instructed to land on runway 11R. After the touchdown, the aircraft covered a total distance of 900 meters until its full stop. The initial 750 meters were with the aircraft supported only by the main landing gears and the last 150 meters were with the aircraft supported by the main landing gears and by the lower part of the front fuselage. The aircraft stopped on the runway. The aircraft suffered substantial damage to structural elements of the aircraft near the nose section. Contributing factors. - Aircraft maintenance - undetermined. It was found that there was a restriction on the articulation movement of the right nose landing gear door and that the weight of this landing gear was not sufficient to overcome such restriction. Upon inspecting the hinges, it was found that there were no signs of recent lubrication, allowing the hypothesis of occurrence of any deviation or non-adherence to the inspection and lubrication requirements established by the manufacturer leading to a the scenario favorable to the right door movement restriction.  The issue of the maintenance could also be related to some deviation, or nonadherence to the requirements established for the service of widening the holes of the hinges concerning the coating and corrosion protection of the worked surface. As a result, the area could have been more susceptible to corrosive processes. - Project - undetermined. The maintenance program, established by the manufacturer, may have contributed to the occurrence by not establishing adequate preventive maintenance parameters for the landing gear doors that were modified by reworking the hinges, incorporating larger radial pins and widening the lobe holes. - Other - undetermined. It was not possible to determine the causal root of the EDP1 gasket extrusion, which caused the leakage of hydraulic oil that caused the hydraulic system 1 to fail.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CENIPA Report number: A-066/CENIPA/2014 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Onderzoeksraad voor de Veiligheid  G1 Globo History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  11 July 2008 PR-OAF OceanAir 0 SÃ£o Paulo/Guarulhos International Airport (GRU/SBGR), SÃ£o Paulo min Tire failure 21 January 2012 PR-OAF Avianca Brasil 0 near BrasÃ­lia, DF min Fumes/smoke/odor event Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates15-Mar-2024 19:49 ASN Updated [Accident report, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

A post-crash fire erupted. Both pilots were killed. The flight was intended to be the first training flight of the newly hired second-in-command (SIC) pilot. The SIC was operating from the airplane's right seat during the training. The airplane departed Bethel Airport, Alaska, at 15:35. After departure, the airplane began a series of training maneuvers, consistent with normal operations. About 21 minutes into the flight, when the airplane was about 3,400 ft mean sea level, it began a steep descent and subsequently impacted terrain. An airplane performance study showed that the airplane reached a nose-down pitch of about -40 degrees and that the descent rate reached about 16,000 ft per minute.  The NTSB determined that it is likely that the check airman simulated a pitch trim excursion and that the trainee, who lacked experience in the airplane type, did not appropriately respond to the excursion. The check airman did not take remedial action and initiate the recovery procedure in time to prevent the control forces from becoming unmanageable and to ensure that recovery from the associated dive was possible. The aircraft impacted frozen tundra and came to rest in an area of heavy willows. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The check airman's delayed remedial action and initiation of a recovery procedure after a simulated pitch trim excursion, which resulted in a loss of airplane control.""METAR: 00:53 UTC / 16:53 local time: PABE 090053Z 36013KT 10SM CLR M07/M16 A2986 RMK AO2 SLP115 T1072116123:53 UTC / 15:53 local time: PABE 082353Z 02008KT 10SM CLR M07/M16 A2987 RMK AO2 SLP119  T10721161 11072 21139 56002=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ANC14FA022 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: KTUU  Anchorage Daily News  FAA  NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) Alaska State Troopers; 60 km SE of Bethel, AK; April 2014 photo (c) Alaska State Troopers; 60 km SE of Bethel, AK; April 2014 photo (c) NTSB; 60 km SE of Bethel, AK; April 2014; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; 60 km SE of Bethel, AK; April 2014; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; 60 km SE of Bethel, AK; April 2014; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft was parked at stand J10 at terminal 2G and was ready for a flight bound for Clermont-Ferrand Airport. The apron management services agent asked the flight to be pushed back facing east. The crew of the airplane parked at J11 then also requested pushback. In order to allow this airplane to start its manoeuvre sooner, the apron management services agent then asked the crew of F-HBLF to be towed, with the assistance of a tug, after its pushback, facing south until abeam stand 12 at the end of their pushback.  During the pushback, the crew of F-HBLF started the airplane's two engines, which stabilised at ground idle. Following the pushback from J10, the airplane was on the axis specified in the documentation. In order to position the airplane on the centreline of taxiway E7, the tug driver had to make the airplane make a turn of about 90Â° with a short turn radius. To do this, he positioned his tug at approximately 90Â° to the airplane axis. When the tug began to pull the aircraft, the safety cotter pins on the tow bar coupling head broke. The coupling head was then only connected to the tow bar by an axle around which it could pivot horizontally. Under the effect of its inertia and the thrust of the two engines at idle, the aircraft continued to advance in a straight line. When the coupling head reached the stop, the airplane pivoted towards the right and collided with the tug. This specific pushback and towing procedure was prohibited for stand J10 following two similar previous occurrences. LESSONS LEARNED AND CONCLUSION: The apron management services agent asked that the pushback be followed by a pull forward with the assistance of the tug, despite the ban in the apron management services operations manual on carrying out this manoeuvre on departure from stand J10. The common use of this manoeuvre at the other stands and the absence of any explanation of the reasons for the ban at that specific stand likely led the apron management services agent to request a non-standard procedure. The tug driver did not question the request from the apron management services agent and repeated by the crew of F-HBLF. The operating instructions in fact specify that the latter are ""according to the instructions from ATC and validation by the aircraft captain"". In order to be able to pull the aeroplane, the driver had to set an excessive angle between the tow bar and the aeroplaneÂs axis. The link between the tug and the aeroplane then broke. The aeroplaneÂs inertia following its being moved and the thrust from its engines at idle made the aeroplane move forward, which led to the collision with the tug. Following this event, the apron management services operations manual was modified to make clear the reasons for the ban.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Report number: f-lf140419.en Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) Google Earth; Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG); 14 April 2015 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight to Kikori was uneventful. The pilot stated that he joined the Kikori circuit upwind for a left downwind and, after completing the pre-landing checks, set up for a landing on runway 30. The pilot reported that, after touchdown, he held the nose wheel off the ground. He stated that the initial landing and roll-through on the steel matting surface were normal. When applying brakes, the aircraft veered left and ran off the runway.  The aircraft subsequently impacted an embankment beyond the left side of the runway, approximately 70 metres from the runway end. The nose of the aircraft was crushed and the nose landing gear partially collapsed rearwards during the impact with the embankment. Two of the left propeller blades were bent. Based on the differences between the pilotÂs statements and the statement by the witness, the AIC was unable to ascertain the exact touchdown point.  Prior to the accident flight, the aircraft had undergone a 100-hourly maintenance check at Port Moresby performed by the operatorÂs maintenance provider. The AIC was informed that during this check the brake pads had been changed and the brake system had been bled and refilled with hydraulic fluid.

The aircraft was scheduled to operate three commercial air transport (cargo) sectors: from Athens to Bergamo, then to Paris Charles de Gaulle, and finally East Midlands. The co-pilot completed the pre-flight external inspection of the aircraft in good light, and found nothing amiss. The departure from Athens was uneventful, but a combination of factors affecting Bergamo (including poor weather, absence of precision approach aids, and work in progress affecting the available landing distance) led the crew to decide to route directly to Paris, where a normal landing was carried out. The aircraft departed Paris for East Midlands at 00:40 hrs UTC, loaded with 10 tonnes of freight, 8 tonnes of fuel (the minimum required was 5.6 tonnes), and with the co-pilot as Pilot Flying. Once established in the cruise, the flight crew obtained the latest ATIS information from East Midlands, which stated that runway 27 was in use, although there was a slight tailwind, and Low Visibility Procedures (LVPs) were in force. They planned to exchange control at about FL100 in the descent, for the commander to carry out a Category III autoland. However, as they neared their destination, the weather improved, LVPs were cancelled, and the flight crew re-briefed for an autopilot approach, followed by a manual landing, to be carried out by the co-pilot. The landing was to be with Flap 30, Autobrake 2, and idle reverse thrust. The final ATIS transmission which the flight crew noted before landing stated that the wind was 130/05 kt, visibility was 3,000 metres in mist, and the cloud was broken at 600 ft aal. The captain established radio contact with the tower controller, and the aircraft was cleared to land; the surface wind was transmitted as 090/05 kt. The touchdown was unremarkable, and the autobrake functioned normally, while the co-pilot applied idle reverse thrust on the engines. As the aircraftÂs speed reduced through approximately 60 kt, the co-pilot handed control to the commander, who then made a brake pedal application to disengage the autobrake system. However, the system remained engaged, so he made a second, more positive, brake application. The aircraft ""shuddered"" and rolled slightly left-wing-low as the lower part of the left main landing gear detached. The captain used the steering tiller to try to keep the aircraft tracking straight along the runway centreline, but it came to a halt slightly off the centreline, resting on its right main landing gear, the remains of the left main landing gear leg, and the left engine lower cowl.  The two crew members were uninjured and there was no fire. Conclusions: The damage to the flap system, fuselage, and MLG equipment was attributable to the detachment of the left MLG axle, wheel and brake assembly. The damage to the MLG outer cylinder, engine and nacelle was as result of the aircraft settling and sliding along the runway. The left MLG axle assembly detached from the inner cylinder due to the momentary increase in bending load during the transition from auto to manual braking. The failure was as a result of stress corrosion cracking and fatigue weakening the high strength steel substrate at a point approximately 75 mm above the axle. It is likely that some degree of heat damage was sustained by the inner cylinder during the overhaul process, as indicated by the presence of chicken wire cracking within the chrome plating over the majority of its surface. However, this was not severe enough to have damaged the steel substrate and therefore may have been coincidental. Although the risk of heat damage occurring during complex landing gear plating and refinishing processes is well understood and therefore mitigated by the manufacturers and overhaul agencies, damage during the most recent refinishing process cannot be discounted. The origin of the failure was an area of intense, but very localised heating, which damaged the chrome protection and changed the metallurgy; ie the formation of martensite within the steel substrate. This resulted in a surface corrosion pit, which, along with the metallurgical change, led to stress corrosion cracking, fatigue propagation and the eventual failure of the inner cylinder under normal loading.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: EW/C2014/04/03 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  25 January 2011 VH-TJH Qantas 0 between Adelaide and Melbourne non Location  Images: photo (c) Richard Blower; East Midlands Airport (EMA/EGNX); 29 April 2014 photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Sydney-Kingsford Smith International Airport, NSW (SYD/YSSY); 04 January 2009 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All occupants sustained fatal injuries. The aircraft, HK-4700, operated on a non-scheduled cargo flight from Villavicencio (VVC) to Florencia (FLA). The takeoff weight was 11,430 kg which included a cargo of 2540 kg. A VFR flight plane was filed with an en route altitude of 6500 feet.  Takeoff was accomplished at 11:15 hours local time. Last radio contact with the flight was at 11:44 hours when the crew reported abeam Uribe. As the flight progressed, visibility deteriorated due to clouds and the crew had difficulty maintaining visual flight. The airplane deviated to the west of the planned route in order to remain visual. This took the flight over mountains with an elevation higher than the en route altitude of the aircraft. After losing visual contact with the ground, the airplane impacted the wooded side of a mountain at about 6500 feet. Probable Causes (translated from Spanish) Failure in evaluating the hazards and risks in the flight planning and decision making related to the execution of a VFR flight between the cities of Villavicencio and Florencia, without verifying the area's minimum altitudes. Untimely interruption of a flight in VFR conditions that resulted in an unexpected flight in IMC.

According to the operator, the captain was the pilot flying and the first officer (FO) was the pilot monitoring. Both pilots indicated that takeoff through the initial descent was uneventful. The aircraft was configured for a flaps 30 landing. During the ILS approach to runway 25L, the captain used the Heads-up Guidance System (HGS) in the IMC mode.  During the decent below 100 feet, the FO indicated that the runway environment was dark and sensed the runway was ""coming close fast"". He noted a slightly increased descent rate and before he could make a callout, the captain had begun to take corrective action.  During the descent, the captain stated he was hand flying the airplane (autopilot and autothrottles were off) and used the localizer, glideslope and flare cues from the HGS. At approximately 30 feet, he transitioned from the HGS to the runway environment, noting it appeared ""pitch black."" He then noticed the runway edge lights and what appeared to be an increased sink rate. Both pilots indicated the airplane touched down firm, then bounced, and the second touch down was harder than the first. Neither were aware that they had struck the tail. The captain did not recall seeing a tail strike warning indication from the HGS. Post flight inspection revealed that the tail strike indicator was compressed and deep scrapes and wear damage to the lower aft fuselage skin. Further investigation revealed multiple fractured frames and buckled stringers, shear ties and straps. The airplane was ferried unpressurized from Las Vegas to Phoenix, AZ (PHX) on January 13 and continued the next day to Seattle-Paine Field, WA.

Flight 890 was a domestic service from Imphal to Guwahati and Delhi in India. The aircraft landed at Guwahati at 11:15 UTC and departed for Delhi at 12:05 UTC with 12.7 tonnes of fuel on board. The filed alternates for the sector were Lucknow and Jaipur in that order.  Overhead Lucknow, the crew received the Lucknow weather and when the aircraft was in range the Delhi ATIS weather was also copied. While in contact with Delhi ATC, the flight was advised to join the hold as the runway 28 RVR at Delhi had dropped to the lower end of CAT I operations. At this point runway 29 was below minima. AI890 was number twelve in sequence and continued to remain in the holding pattern for the next 20-25 minutes. During this period there was no attempt on the part of flight crew to seek Lucknow weather. Air India Flight dispatch also did not given any advice to the flight about Jaipur or Lucknow weather. The weather (visibility / RVR) reported on runway 29 was below CAT I conditions so runway was not available for this flight at that moment as the First Officer was only Cat I qualified. The aircraft flew 3 holds before intercepting the localizer runway 28 at 35 miles. RVR runway 28 also dropped below Cat. I minimas, therefore the crew discontinued approach and climbed to 8000 feet on runway heading before going on heading 180. Though the first planned diversion alternate was Lucknow, which had visibility of 2000 m (above minima), the captain elected to divert to Jaipur. Reason was that they were closer to Jaipur and they had inquired about the visibility from Dispatch for Jaipur, which was provided as 2000 m. At this stage the crew did not check complete weather of Jaipur. Minimum diversion fuel to Jaipur was 2.9 tonnes. AI890 commenced diversion to Jaipur with Fuel on Board of 3.1 tonnes.  The aircraft came in contact with Jaipur for the first time when it was at 68 DME from Jaipur. At that time the crew came to know of the complete weather of Jaipur from the ATIS, which read: visibility of 900 m, dew point 13Â°C, temperature 13Â°C, and RVR 1000m. At 60 miles and passing flight level 138, the crew informed Jaipur that the aircraft was descending for flight level 100 as cleared by Delhi control. The aircraft again informed Jaipur ATC its position at 55 miles, 50 miles and 42 miles from Jaipur which were also acknowledged by Jaipur ATC. During these contacts, weather of Jaipur was neither asked by the crew nor provided by ATC. When the aircraft was at flight level 83, the crew asked ATC Jaipur to confirm that they could carry out an ILS approach for runway 27 via the 10 DME arc. While confirming the requested approach, Jaipur ATC informed all the stations about the weather at that moment as visibility 400 m and RVR 1000 m. When the aircraft was at 30 miles from Jaipur, Jaipur ATC passed weather as visibility 400 m, RVR 1000 m and trend visibility becoming 350 m. At 28 DME from Jaipur, the aircraft was maintaining 6000 feet and on request was cleared by Jaipur ATC to descend to 5000 feet. When the aircraft was at 25 DME, from Jaipur, ATC advised that the weather was deteriorating rapidly and visibility was 400 meters. The crew however informed ATC that they were committed to land at Jaipur due to the aircraft fuel state. The fuel on board at that point of time was approx 2.6 tonnes and approach was commenced for Jaipur with a visibility of 500 m with trend reducing. The aircraft was no. 2 in approach at Jaipur and was cleared for the VOR/DME arc ILS approach runway 27 at 25 nm.  Due to reducing visibility, Jaipur ATC asked all the aircraft inbound for Jaipur to come over head and join the JJP hold. The crew of AI890 asked for the weather which was provided as visibility 400 m and RVR 1000 m though RVR deteriorating to 550 m. The flight continued and flew the VOR/DME arc for an ILS runway 27 approach. ATC transmitted the RVR as 200 m and visibility as 50 m with trend reducing. Another scheduled flight ahead of AI890 carried out a missed approach and diverted to Ahmedabad. When the aircraft was above MDA (1480 feet AGL), ATC reported RVR 50 m and cleared the aircraft to land subject to minima. Both the flight crew maintained that they had seen the runway lights. The ILS approach was performed with dual auto pilot until 200ft Radio Altitude. After descending below MDA on auto pilot, the commander disconnected the auto pilot. The captain performed the final approach manually. The aircraft deviated to the left of the runway centre line and touched down on soft ground (in kutcha) on the left hand side of the runway. During touchdown and landing roll, the visibility was zero and crew were unable to see any of the reference cues. The crew had heard rumbling sound during landing roll. The commander stated that he did the manual landing as he was not sure if he could do an auto-land on a ground facility which is CAT I certified airfield in actual zero visibility. The aircraft continued to roll/ skid on the unpaved surface and during this period the left wing impacted trees causing damage to the left wing. Thereafter aircraft turned right and entered the runway finally coming to a halt on the left hand side of runway. There was no fire. The aircraft was disabled on the runway, forcing the following flight (a SpiceJet Boeing 737-800, flight SG256) to carry out a missed approach. That flight was already low on fuel after diverting from Delhi to Jaipur, just like AI890. The captain of SG256 then decided to return to Delhi irrespective of reported visibility and RVR. After diverting to Delhi, the aircraft came in contact with ATC Delhi, declared a MAYDAY due fuel with a request for straight and short vector for ILS 28. During the ILS approach for runway 28, the tower had reported RVR for runway 28 as 375m/900m/50m. A dual channel auto land was carried out.  Fuel remaining at that time was 400 kgs. Fuel remaining during engine shut down was 150 kgs. PROBABLE CAUSE: The cause below has been given considering events as a combination of organizational factors and human error. - The flight crew made an erroneous decision of diverting & continuing to an airfield with reducing visibility. - The flight crew attempted a manual landing in below minima conditions. - Lack of operational supervision and desired ground support to flight. - Internal quality assurance not capturing the hazards which slipped through due complacency - Lack of oversight of the flight operations.METAR: 14:30 UTC / 20:00 local time: VIDP 051430Z 00000KT 0050 R28/0800 R29/0200 FG VV/// 11/11 Q1013 NOSIGDelhi14:30 UTC / 20:00 local time: VIJP 051430Z VRB00KT 0900 R27/1500D MIFG NSC 13/13 Q1014 BECMG 0800Jaipur15:30 UTC / 21:00 local time: VIDP 051530Z 00000KT 0000 R28/0450 R10/0050 R29/0000 R11/0050 FG VV/// 09/09 Q1014 NOSIGDelhi16:00 UTC / 21:30 local time: VIDP 051600Z 00000KT R28/0450 R29/0000 R10/0040 R11/0000 FG VV/// 08/08 Q1014 NOSIGDelhi16:30 UTC / 22:00 local time: VIJP 051630Z 00000KT 0000 R27/0150 FG NSC 13/13 Q1015 NOSIGJaipurAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB India Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Singapore-Changi International Airport (SIN/WSSS); 24 December 2005 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The copilot was fatally injured; the captain and the passenger received serious injuries. The flight originated from the Tucson International Airport (TUS), Arizona, at 10:04 and was bound for Aspen. The departure and en route portions of the flight were uneventful. As the flight neared its destination, a high-altitude, terrain-limited airport, air traffic control (ATC) provided vectors to the localizer/distance measuring equipment (LOC/DME)-E approach to runway 15. About 12:10, the local controller informed the flight crew that the wind was from 290Âº at 19 knots (kts) with gusts to 25 kts. About 12:11, the flight crew reported that they were executing a missed approach and then requested vectors for a second approach. ATC vectored the airplane for a second LOC/DME-E approach to runway 15. About 12:21, the local controller informed the flight crew that the wind was from 330Â° at 16 kts and the 1-minute average wind was from 320Â° at 14 kts gusting to 25 kts. The initial part of the airplane's second approach was as-expected for descent angle, flap setting, and spoilers. During the final minute of flight, the engines were advanced and retarded five times, and the airplane's airspeed varied between 135 kts and 150 kts. The final portion of the approach to the runway was not consistent with a stabilized approach. The airplane stayed nose down during its final descent and initial contact with the runway. The vertical acceleration and pitch parameters were consistent with the airplane pitch oscillating above the runway for a number of seconds before a hard runway contact, a gain in altitude, and a final impact into the runway at about 6 g. The weather at the time of the accident was near or in exceedance of the airplane's maximum tailwind and crosswind components for landing, as published in the airplane flight manual. Given the location of the airplane over the runway when the approach became unstabilized and terrain limitations of Aspen, performance calculations were completed to determine if the airplane could successfully perform a go-around. Assuming the crew had control of the airplane, and that the engines were advanced to the appropriate climb setting, anti-ice was off, and tailwinds were less than a sustained 25 kts, the airplane had the capability to complete a go-around, clearing the local obstacles along that path. Both flight crewmembers had recently completed simulator training for a type rating in the CL-600 airplane. The captain reported that he had a total of 12 to 14 hours of total flight time in the airplane type, including the time he trained in the simulator. The copilot would have had close to the same hours as the captain given that they attended flight training together. Neither flight crew member would have met the minimum flight time requirement of 25 hours to act as pilot-in-command under Part 135. The accident flight was conducted under Part 91, and therefore, the 25 hours requirement did not apply to this portion of their trip. Nevertheless, the additional flight time would have increased the crew's familiarity with the airplane and its limitation and likely improved their decision-making during the unstabilized approach. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The flight crew's failure to maintain airplane control during landing following an unstabilized approach. Contributing to the accident were the flight crew's decision to land with a tailwind above the airplane's operating limitations and their failure not to conduct a go-around when the approach became unstabilized.""METAR: 18:53 UTC / 11:53 local time: KASE 051853Z 31009G28KT 270V360 9SM HZ FEW035 BKN046 OVC050 M11/M20 A3007 RMK AO2 PK WND 33028/1851 SLP243 T11111200 $Wind 310 degrees at 9 knots, gusting to 28 knots; wind variable between 270 and 360 degrees; Visibility: 9 miles in haze; few clouds at 3500 feet AGL, broken clouds at 4600 feet AGL, overcast cloud deck at 5000 feet AGL; Temperature: -11Â°C, Dew point -20Â°C; pressure 30.07 inches Hg.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN14FA099 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Flightaware flight route  LiveATC (audio file of Aspen Tower ATC)  Private jet crashes Aspen Airport; 1 dead, 2 hurt (KABC)  Flightaware accident info  ABC News  NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Aspen-Pitkin County Airport, CO (ASE); January 2014; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Aspen-Pitkin County Airport, CO (ASE); January 2014; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Aspen-Pitkin County Airport, CO (ASE); January 2014; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Aspen-Pitkin County Airport, CO (ASE); January 2014; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

When preparing for landing in MED, the flight crew lowered the landing gear but the right main landing gear did not lower into the extended position. The flight crew notified the MED Air Traffic Control Tower of the discrepancy. The flight crew attempted to use the alternate procedure to lower the right main landing gear without success. The flight crew eventually landed the aircraft with the right main landing gear in the retracted position. The aircraft made a smooth touch down, slowing until the right engine nacelle contacted the runway. The aircraft remained under control during the landing with no injuries to the aircraft occupants. During the evacuation of the aircraft, fourteen passengers received minor injuries and three passengers were seriously injured while sliding down the L-1 slide. Findings 1. A foreign air carrier, the C-11 maintenance check provider, did not identify the number 1 or number 7 brake assemblies having eroded safety wire holes in the lock bolts installed on the brake rod retaining pin when performing a C-11 maintenance check. 2. All lock bolts installed on the brake rod retaining bolts should have been identified and evaluated for serviceability and replaced as necessary. 3. Orient Thai did not identify eroded safety wire holes in the lock bolts during the performance of maintenance activities including, brake replacement tasks, daily checks, and transit checks. 4. The accident was precipitated by the loss of two lock bolts that were not (or were not able to be) safety wired in place. Safety wiring the lock bolts would have prevented the right main landing gear brake rod retaining bolt from loosening and falling away from the pin.Sources: SABQ Online newspaper  AIB-2014-0001   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All four on board were killed. Before departure from Shoreham Airport, U.K, the pilot had called the destination airport, Trier-FÃ¶hren. He was told it would be better to postpone the departure because of thick fog. The departure was not postponed and the Citation jet took off from Shoreham about 10:00 hours. Alternate airfields were Luxembourg and Frankfurt-Hahn. Given the weather conditions the owner of the aircraft expected a diversion, and according to family members did not but pressure on the pilots to land at Trier. The en route and descent part of the flight were uneventful. At 11:45, while descending from FL90 to 5000 feet, the pilot in command contacted air traffic control to cancel their IFR clearance. The controller confirmed this and reported that they were 15 miles northwest of their destination airfield. The airplane was approaching runway 22 and descended until it was flying at a very low altitude, clearing trees by some 15-20 meters, according to eyewitnesses. It pulled up and struck an electricity pylon at a height of about 8 m above the ground. Control was lost and the airplane rolled inverted and crashed. It came to rest inverted on the site of a landfill, located 3,8 km from the threshold of runway 22 and about 700 m to the left of the extended centreline. A fire erupted. The continued descent to the ground likely occurred due to an erroneous selection of the target altitude with 0 ft (sea level) instead of the real aerodrome elevation (666 ft AMSL). Good Crew Resource Management could have brought this error to light but the different personality traits of the two pilots and particularly the captainÂs low appreciation of the co-pilot probably negatively influenced the working relationship in regards to CRM principles.  Weather at Trier about the time of the accident was a visibility of 100-150 m in fog, wind 040Â° at 3-5 knots, temperature -1Â°C, QNH 1020 hPa. Causes The accident was due to the following: - The Pilot in Command (PIC) decided to conduct the VFR approach even though he was aware of the prevailing instrument weather conditions at the airport - It is likely that a wrong vertical profile was flown due to an erroneous selection on the navigation system  - Due to an insufficient situational awareness of the pilots the descent was not aborted in time.

The airplane was destroyed. The pilot and cargo handler suffered fatal injuries. The aircraft took off from Olive Creek at 10:54, carrying fuel and other supplies for gold mining operations. Two and a half minutes after takeoff the engine lost power. The aircraft lost height and impacted an undulating and heavily forested area. Since only three of the seven oil drums were secured, the remaining four shifted forward during the crash. In June 2013 the aircraft received a Blackhawk modification, which consisted among others of the installation of a factory new P&W PT6A-42A engine. CONCLUSIONS: The investigation revealed that the probable cause of the accident was due to a power loss suffered by the engine. The power loss was associated with the fracture of one of the 1st stage compressor stator vanes by fatigue. The fatigue crack originated from a lack of brazing adhesion extending over approximately 0.280 inches along the chord length and 0.050 inches in the direction of the shroud thickness and was located between the leading edge and mid-chord of the vane.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: GCAA-AIT Report number: GCAA: 2/5/1/73 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources: Stabroek News 18-1-2014  CND 19-1-2014  Stabroek News 20-1-2014  AP, 19 Jan 2015   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane originated in Managua, Nicaragua and operated on a non-scheduled cargo flight to Saltillo via Tapachula, Mexico. The flight landed at Tapachula at 00:25 hours local time. An IFR flight plan was then filed for Saltillo, with Monterrey as alternate. It was not taken into account though, that Monterrey's main runway was closed that night as per Notam. The flight departed Tapachula at 01:40. The flight was uneventful up to the approach. The aircraft carried out an ILS/DME approach to runway 17. At 04:05 the flight was cleared to land by the controller. One minute later the pilot reported going around. He stated that they would divert to their alternate, Monterrey Airport. At 04:15 the pilot again contacted the controller at Saltillo, reporting that Monterrey Airport was closed and requesting another approach to runway 17. He radioed: ""We saw runway but ehhh let's do a rough minimum approach or below the minimums"". The airplane continued the approach until it touched down to the right of the centreline and on the last third of the runway. It rolled off the side and the nose gear collapsed. Probable Cause: ""Continuing the precision approach (ILS CAT 1) in conditions of reduced visibility by fog (no visual contact with the runway at an airport below minimums), which resulted in an abrupt landing and misaligned to the right on the last third of the runway, during a second landing attempt, the Commission also determined that what caused the continuation of the landing was the lack of fuel to fly to a second alternate airport not contemplated in the operation"". Contributing factors: 1. Lack of analysis of pre-flight operational information (current NOTAMs, METAR, forecasts, fuel to second alternate airport and flight tracking) 2. Unstabilized approach 3. Lack of application of CRM concepts 4. Lack of adherence to procedure - operations, of providing METAR and NOTAM to the crew for the dispatch of the aircraft. 5. Lack of adherence to the procedure for flight control and tracking 6. Lack of procedures to establish two alternate airports when the destination airport is below minimums. 7. Lack of Company supervision, operation and maintenance surveillance of aircraft flight recorders.METAR: 09:45 UTC / 03:45 local time: MMIO 180945Z 00000KT 1/2SM FG OVC003 05/04 A3028 RMK 8/5//10:28 UTC / 04:28 local time: MMIO 181028Z 00000KT 1/2SM FG OVC003 05/04 A3028 RMK 8/5//Wind calm; Visibility: 0,5 miles (800 m) in fog; overcast cloud deck at 300 feet AGL; Temperature: +5Â°C, Dew point: +4Â°C; Pressure: 30.28 inches Hg.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIDAIA Mexico Report number: ACC/DT/AF/A/005/2014 MMIO Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Zocalo Saltillo History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  4 September 1976 PH-DNM KLM Royal Dutch Airlines 0 Larnaca Airport (LCA) non Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The accident flight was a commercial ferry flight from Roskilde to Merville, France. After takeoff from runway 11 at Roskilde, the aircraft was established in climb with a nose-up pitch attitude of approximately 13-15Â°. Just before reaching the flap retraction altitude of 400 feet above ground level, the flight crew noticed ""something white"" in front of the aircraft. The commander, who was the pilot flying, immediately initiated an aircraft pitch increase, but almost simultaneously a ""bang"" was heard and a bump was felt in the aircraft, most likely coming from the underside of the aircraft. The flight crew observed large white birds below the aircraft. The flight crew realized that the aircraft had been hit by one or more birds, probably Mute Swans, and decided to leave the flaps at the takeoff setting of 15Â°. Cockpit indications did not show any abnormalities and the aircraft handling and controllability did feel normal by the flight crew. In order to return to Roskilde, the flight crew performed a visual traffic pattern and approach to runway 11, followed by a normal landing and roll-out. The aircraft taxied to the run-up area for runway 29, where an inspection performed by the fire and rescue service personnel revealed that fuel leaked from the left wing. CONCLUSIONS: The accident was caused by a multiple birdstrike.  Up to four Mute Swans damaged the left wing leading edge and the nose radome which resulted in bending of the skin and the stringer structure beneath.  The left wing integral fuel tank structure was damaged resulting in a fuel leak.   Three contributing factors were identified:  1. The lighting condition in combination with the colour of the birds.  2. The small relative movement between the birds and the aircraft.  3. The aircraft nose-up pitch attitude might have impaired the flight crewÂs forward vision.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: HCLJ Report number: HCLJ510-2014-257 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) AIB Denmark; Roskilde Airport (RKE); January 2014 photo (c) AIB Denmark; Roskilde Airport (RKE); January 2014 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were no personal injuries on the 3 crew and 16 passengers on board. Flight F7-250 had departed Leipzig Airport (LEJ), Germany on a scheduled service to Paris-CDG. The copilot was the Pilot Flying (PF) while the captain was Pilot Monitoring (PM). The flight was cleared to perform an ILS approach to runway 27R. The aircraft intercepted the glide slope at 07:25.  The tower controller then cleared the flight to land and reported wind from 200Â° at 12 kt.  The captain again advises the OPL by reminding him when to set up the aircraft for landing. At an altitude of 2,300 ft the landing configuration was set (20Â° flap) and the approach target speed of 123 kt was selected.  At a height of 1000 ft, the approach was stable and the runway was in sight. At a height of about 400 ft, the PF disconnected the autopilot and at 200 ft, the decision height, the crew decided to continue the approach. Passing 50 ft, the PF gradually returned the power levers to the ""flight idle"" position and initiated the flare. Shortly before touchdown the captain pulled on the control column to the maximum nose-up value (11Â°) and the attitude reached a value of 5Â°. The wheels of the main landing gear hit the ground hard, and the airplane was at an indicated speed of about 120 kt. The airplane then bounced. The copilot then pushed the control column forward, causing a nose down attitude. De PM then again pulled on the controls and the aircraft bounced a second time. The PM increased power which was immediately reduced by the PF. The nose landing gear of the aircraft then impacted the runway and collapsed. Conclusion (translated from French): During the flare, the PIC said that the landing was going to be hard. In the emergency, he acted quickly  by pulling on the controls without announcing his intentions to Copilot. This lack of coordination within the crew led to a double piloting and successive and opposite actions on the flight controls during the management of the bounced landing.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Report number: hb-g140128 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: BEA History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  1 February 2001 HB-IZG Crossair 0 ZÃ¼rich-Kloten Airport (ZRH/LSZH) min Fumes/smoke/odor event Location  Images: photo (c) Markus Eigenheer; GenÃ¨ve-Cointrin Airport (GVA/LSGG); 08 November 2013; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Flight GL-3205 originated in Kangerlussuaq, Greenland. Three passengers were taken to the hospital for observation, there were no fatalities or serious injuries. On initial radio contact with Ilulissat AFIS, the flight crew got the information that runway 07 was in use. Weather information showed wind from 150Â° magnetic at 24 knots, maximum 33 knots, minimum 17 knots; a 24 knots cross wind, and a headwind of 5 knots. The wind at threshold runway 25 was gusting to 41 knots. Visibility was fine (10 km) with broken clouds at 12000 feet. The flight crew got visual contact with the Ilulissat area and due to the wind conditions and consequently expected turbulence on final, the flight crew prepared for a NDB/DME approach to runway 07 via JV NDB. Due to the cross wind conditions, the flight crew decided to do a landing with a flap setting of 15Â°.  The flight crew asked Ilulissat AFIS for a confirmation of whether or not the cross winds of 24 knots included the gusting wind conditions up to maximum 33 knots. Ilulissat AFIS replied that the maximum wind was 35 knots and the cross wind was 26 knots.  On a 5 miles final to runway 07, the wind conditions were reported to be 140Â° magnetic at 28 knots with a maximum of 35 knots and a cross wind of 26 knots. On short final to runway 07, the wind conditions were reported to 140Â° magnetic and 25 knots, maximum to 39 knots.  Upon touchdown on runway 07, the left main landing gear collapsed. With the left main landing collapsed and after approximately 104 meters of runway rolling, the flight crew started to loose aircraft directional control. After approximately 389 meters, the aircraft ran off the left side of the runway and into the safety zone. The aircraft skidded sideways, hit the Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) to runway 25, skidded down a steep slope and impacted a rocky area approximately 10 meters below the runway elevation.  The crew members initiated an evacuation of the aircraft. The flight crew found the flight deck door jammed and evacuated the flight deck through the flight compartment emergency exit hatch. The cabin crew member and a passenger had difficulties opening a partly jammed main entrance door. In cooperation with the commander from the outside of the aircraft, they succeeded. From the outside of the aircraft, the commander opened the forward right hand cabin emergency exit door. The passengers and the cabin crew member evacuated the passenger cabin trough the main entrance door. The overall evacuation took approximately 30-40 seconds. Ilulissat Airport has a single, 07/25 asphalt runway, 845 m (2772 ft) long. Runway 07 has a 0,8% downslope for the first 550 m, followed by a 0,2% upslope for 295 m. Conclusion: Adverse crosswind conditions at BGJN led to flight crew target fixation, a flight crew divergence from the operator's stabilized approach parameters and a mental blocking of an appropriate decision on going around.  The flight crew divergence from the operator's stabilized approach parameters induced a non-stabilized approach, which in combination with power levers retarded below flight idle in flight resulted in an accelerated rate of descent leading to a hard landing, with side load on the left main landing gear at touchdown.  The left main landing gear structural fuse pin sheared as a result of lateral and vertical overload stress. Cycling the power levers between ground and flight range prevented an appropriate deceleration of the aircraft and prolonged the landing roll.  The prolonged landing roll combined with the application of full left rudder and no decisive use of reverse thrust on the side with the unaffected main landing gear made it impossible for the flight crew to maintain directional control.  The lack of directional control resulted in the aircraft running off the side of the runway and the safety zone, respectively.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: HCLJ Report number: HCLJ510-2014-258 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Air Greenland   Location  Images: photo (c) AIB Denmark; Ilulissat Airport (JAV); 29 January 2014 photo (c) AIB Denmark; Ilulissat Airport (JAV); 29 January 2014 photo (c) Martin KleinwÃ¤chter; Kulusuk Airport (KUS/BGKK); 08 August 2012 photo (c) Timo Blossfeld; Seattle/Tacoma International Airport, WA (SEA/KSEA); 08 June 2007 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates26-Apr-2024 17:20 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The copilot was at the controls of the airplane while the pilot monitored the airplaneâs systems and prepared for takeoff. During the engine start, one of the two linemen providing ground services to the airplane departed the ramp area leaving one lineman alone, which the operator allowed for normal ground servicing operations. After completing the engine start, the copilot gave the disconnect ground power hand signal to the lineman. The lineman responded with the hold hand signal and then moved to the left and rear of the airplane to disconnect the ground power unit (GPU). The pilot stated that he monitored the airplane's voltmeter to verify that the GPU was disconnected by observing a drop in the voltage current. However, although the drop in voltage could confirm that the GPU was no longer supplying power, it could not confirm that the GPU cable was disconnected. The pilot then looked out the window and realized that the airplane was moving forward. The pilot took the controls, applied the brakes, and set the parking brake. The pilot did not have visual contact with the lineman, so he asked the two crewmembers seated in the cabin to locate him, and one of the crewmembers reported that she saw him standing next to the GPU. The pilot then began to taxi the airplane for departure within the nonmovement area of the ramp; the pilot did not realize that the GPU was still connected to the airplane. As the airplane turned right, the GPU was pulled onto its side, and it then fell onto the linemanâs right leg, which resulted in a serious injury. The pilot stopped the airplane and shut down the engines without further incident. The pilot should have ensured that the GPU was disconnected from the airplane via hand signals from the lineman providing ground services before taxiing the airplane and his failure to do so resulted in the linemanâs injury. Probable Cause: The pilotâs failure to ensure that the ground power unit was disconnected from the airplane via hand signals from the lineman providing ground services before taxiing, which resulted in an injury to the lineman.

The aircraft operated as East Air flight ETJ704 from Moscow's Domodedovo Airport to Kulob. Weather at Kulob was poor due to heavy snowfall. The airport's single runway, 01/19 (3000 m long, 45 m wide), was cleared of snow on the north side. The south side, from the threshold to the middle of the runway, was partly cleared with path of 21 m wide. On both sides of the path a 50-95 cm high snow berm was present. During final approach to runway 01 the pilot in command disconnected the autopilot and switched to manual control of the airplane. The plane landed on runway 01 at a distance of 230 m from the runway threshold, at a speed of 255 km/h. The wheels of the right hand main gear crossed the border the runway at a distance of about 520 m from the threshold and the aircraft continued along the side of the runway. The wheels left main landing gear remained on the runway. At a distance of 710 m from the threshold both engines quit due to ingress of large amounts of snow. The nose landing gear collapsed and the airplane slid until it stopped 1190 m from the beginning of the runway. There was no fire and none of the occupants were injured. CONCLUSION (translation from Russian): The cause of the accident with the aircraft A320-231 EY-623 was the aircraft collision with a snow berm while landing on an unprepared runway, which was cleared by a width of about 22m (runway width being 45m), and where there were snow berms at a height of 50-95cm along the borders. The aircraft's right main gear contacted a snow berm, which led to the destruction of the nose landing gear and self-termination of engines and the aircraft moving off the runway to the right. The accident was the result of a combination of the following factors: - decision by the flight director to receive an aircraft on an unprepared runway; - the unreadiness of the runway at the time of arrival of the aircraft and the failure to make a corresponding entry in the ""Journal of the state of the airfield"" with the runway measures.METAR: 02:00 UTC / 07:00 local time: UTDK 020200Z 26003MPS 0800 SN FZFG VV003 M09/M10 Q1031 0129//60 RMK QBB100 QFE715/0953Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: A320 EY-623 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) Interstate Aviation Committee; Kulob Airport (TJU); 02 February 2014 photo (c) Interstate Aviation Committee; Kulob Airport (TJU); 02 February 2014 photo (c) Interstate Aviation Committee; Kulob Airport (TJU); 02 February 2014 photo (c) Interstate Aviation Committee; Kulob Airport (TJU); 02 February 2014 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The captain indicated that, while the airplane was level at about 2,000 ft on the base leg, the flight entered clouds. The first officer stated that she noted moisture on the windshield wiper and the captain indicated that the wind screen was wet. The cockpit voice recorder (CVR) recorded the captain and first officer briefly discussing ice; however, the airplane's ice protection system, which was set to the automatic mode, did not operate automatically, and the crew did not activate the system manually. The crew did not see the ice light come on and there were no icing messages on the engine indicating and crew alerting system. As the first officer was applying control inputs to adjust for a crosswind, a rapid roll to the right occurred, which resulted in a wing strike and substantial damage to the airplane.  About forty minutes after arrival at the gate, an examination of the airplane found an accretion of ice on the leading edge of both wings. The aircraft performance study, which correlated icing charts with the airplane's flight profile, determined that the airplane spent over 20 minutes at altitudes where icing was probable during both approaches. The study concluded that the right roll was not commanded by the flight crew but likely due to ice buildup.  Although the vertical load factor did not indicate that the airplane experienced a full aerodynamic stall, the ice buildup likely created enough flow separation on one wing for it to lose lift during the flare, without affecting the control of the aircraft in a measurable way during the approach.  After the accident, the ice detection and anti-ice systems were tested at the aircraft level with no anomalies identified. The ice detectors were also functionally tested by the manufacturer at the component level with no anomalies identified that could have contributed to the event. A review of FDR data revealed that no failures were recorded for the ice detection system during the accident flight. Additionally, the system operated as expected during a manual preflight test and detected icing conditions during the previous flight. A review of the maintenance records did not reveal any systematic problems with the ice detection system.  Therefore, it could not be determined why the ice detection system did not detect the presence of icing conditions even though the airplane accreted ice during the approach. This possibly could have been due to variations in static air temperature that prevented the ice that accumulated on the sensors from reaching the alert threshold or the occurrence of meteorological conditions out of the 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 25 Appendix C during approach, or a combination of these two factors.Ã¢â¬Â Although the ice detection system did not automatically activate the ice protection system, the CVR recorded a brief discussion during the final approach indicating that the crew was aware that the airplane was picking up 'a little bitÃ¢â¬Â of ice.  According to the Trans States Airlines EMB145 Airplane Operations Manual (AOM) and Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), even though the airplane is equipped with an ice detector, the crew was responsible for monitoring icing conditions and for manual activation of the ice protection system when necessary.  Therefore, the crew recognized that the airplane was operating in icing conditions and accumulating ice and should have manually activated the ice protection system. It is likely the crew's overreliance on automation for the activation and proper operation of the ice and rain protection system resulted in their failure to adequately monitor the system and respond appropriately when it did not activate automatically. Although the AOM and SOPs indicated that the crew is responsible for monitoring icing conditions and for manual activation of the ice protection system when necessary, there was no information in Trans States Airlines ground training modules that presented the crew as being responsible for monitoring and activating the ice and rain protection system when no warnings or cautions were received from the EICAS. Additionally, manual ice detection methods for flight crews to use when flying in potential icing conditions were not specifically referenced during ground training. The Trans States Airlines manager of flight standards said that manual selection of the anti-ice system was not emphasized in training like the automatic mode of operation was during flight operations. It is possible that because the manual operation of the airplane's ice protection system was not emphasized during training, the crew may not have recognized the need to perform this task.  Trans States Airlines issued an operations bulletin after the accident that stated interim procedures for crewmembers to follow when operating in potential in-flight icing conditions. The bulletin called for active monitoring of the deicing/anti-icing equipment and, if it did not activate, to accomplish the QRH's Ice Detectors Fail procedures.   Probable Cause: the failure of the flight crew to adequately monitor the system for proper operation and manually activate the system during the flight in icing conditions. Contributing to the accident was the crew's limited training on the manual operation of the anti-ice system and the nonactivation of the automatic ice detection system for reasons that could not be determined.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA14FA058 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 7 years Download report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA14FA058  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates06-Oct-2022 18:08 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

The damage were found after the training flight was completed.  The crew were uninjured.  Japan Transport Safety Board says the trainee probably changed from a crab approach to a wing-low attitude to counter the crosswind, and that the aircraft initially contacted the runway with its right-hand main gear. The Dash 8 bounced and pitched up slightly, says the inquiry, and the trainee pushed on the control column â a decision which âabruptlyâ caused the aircraft to pitch to 4.57Â° nose-down. JTSB says the trainee had thought the nose of the turboprop was âtaking longerâ to lower than it should have. He had also been influenced by the captainâs observations that he tended to pitch the nose too high while switching from crabbing to a wing-low attitude, and that he also needed to push harder on the control column to maintain direction during take-off. JTSB says the recorded impact was 2.016g, and this caused the shock strut brace of the nose-gear to contact the runway surface. It is probable that the accident occurred while the aircraft was landing under strong crosswind, under the condition that the main landing gear grounded without sufficient load being applied, the nose of the airplane downed excessively and the nose landing gear grounded heavily, which caused damage on the nose landing gear and the deformation of the right and left fuselage skins. As for the nose landing gear of the aircraft grounding heavily, it is probable that the trainee continuously downed the nose, and subsequently the captain who was the instructor failed to provided an appropriate corrective operation.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JTSB Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: http://jtsb.mlit.go.jp/jtsb/aircraft/detail.php?id=2082  [LINK NOT WORKING ANYMORE:http://www.nhk.or.jp/lnews/nagasaki/5035213083.html?t=1392294916081]  http://www.orc-air.co.jp/db_img/news_img/272/c20140213123519343.pdf  http://www.mlit.go.jp/jtsb/eng-air_report/JA801B.pdf History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  8 March 2017 JA801B Oriental Air Bridge 0 over Sasebo city, Nagasaki prefecture unk 27 September 2017 JA801B Oriental Air Bridge 0 Nagasaki prefecture unk Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates13-Feb-2014 13:10 isamuel Added 25-May-2016 14:01 Aerossurance Updated [Time, Source, Narrative, ]03-Jul-2023 09:27 harro Updated Corrections or additions? ...

All 18 on board sustained fatal injuries. Flight RA183 was a domestic flight from Kathmandu to Jumla with a refueling stop at Pokhara. The airplane took off from Pokhara at 12:43. Upon leaving Pokhara Control Zone, the pilot in command realized that the direct track was not possible due weather and decided to proceed via a more southern track. During the flight the pilots were experiencing uncomfortable flying environment due to unfavorable weather conditions. Attempting to avoid the weather, the pilots had to fly up and down and changing the heading. Finally being unable to penetrate the weather ahead, the captain decided to divert to Bhairahawa, the nearest airport. However, the captain did not take into consideration the surrounding terrain and continued descent turning right.  The aircraft initially slashed a small tree and finally impacted a ridge. Due to the heavy impact the left wing was first disintegrated and then the front part of the aircraft toppled over beyond the ridge with several subsequent impacts. The cockpit voice recorder showed that the copilot had warned the captain not to descend or turn. The wreckage was located the following morning at an altitude of 7190 feet (2192 m). There were no surivors. Causes: After detail investigation and thorough analysis of the circumstances and evidences, the Commission has determined that the most probable causes of the accident is the  ""Losing situational awareness on the part of PIC while flying into instrument meteorological weather condition to the extent of Collision with terrain."" The contributing factors to the occurrence are; - Deteriorated weather associated with western disturbance, unstable in nature and embedded CB. - Inappropriate and insufficient crew coordination while changing course of action.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Nepal AAIC Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: ekantipur.com  Nepali Times  Hemant Arjyal  SKYbraryÂ  History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  5 July 1992 9N-ABB Royal Nepal Airlines 0 Jumla Airport (JUM) sub Location  Images: photo (c) Krish Dulal; near Sandhikhark; 17 February 2014; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Kathmandu-Tribhuvan Airport (KTM/VNKT); 27 October 2011 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight had originated from Novgorod International Airport, Russia. The Aircraft was parked on the F1 parking with a Passenger Loading Bridge docked at Door 1 Left (L1).  Approximately 3 hours and 30 minutes after blocks on, the aircraft was struck on the aft right fuselage by a Hi-Loader catering truck. The force of the collision caused the aircraft nose wheel to turn about its axis for approximately 30 degrees and the nose of the aircraft was deflected approximately four meters to the right of the parking bay centreline.  During the collision sequence, a gap opened rapidly between the Passenger Loading Bridge (PLB) and the aircraft door (L1). A female cabin crewmember was standing in the vicinity of door L1. As result of the sudden movement of the aircraft the crewmember fell through the gap from a height of approximately 3 meters onto the tarmac.  The crewmember sustained serious injury and was transported to the hospital.  Causes The Air Accident Investigation Sector determines that the causes of the Accident were: 3.3.1 The catering vehicle driver was not aware that the vehicle was approaching the Aircraft at excessive speed; and 3.3.2 The performance of the driver was degraded, most probably, due to tiredness or distraction.

Of the 120 passengers and crew onboard, two flight attendants were seriously injured, and one FA and nine passengers received minor injuries. The airplane was not damaged. The flight was operating under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 as a regularly scheduled passenger flight from Denver International Airport (DEN), Denver, Colorado, to Billings Logan International Airport (BIL), Billings, Montana. The flight departed DEN normally and climbed to a cruising altitude of flight level (FL) 380. The flight encountered light turbulence and the crew requested, and was granted, a descent to FL360 followed by a descent to FL340. The flight crew extinguished the seat belt sign when the ride smoothed out. Flight data recorder (FDR) data indicated the airplane was cruising about FL340 when it encountered an area of severe turbulence for about 55 seconds. The most severe turbulence occurred for about 10 seconds when the vertical acceleration fluctuated between about -1.23 g's and +2.05 g's, the lateral acceleration fluctuated between about -0.27 g's and +0.23 g's, the pitch fluctuated between about +5.8Â° (nose up) and -1.8Â° (nose down), and the roll fluctuated between about 14Â° left and 20Â° right. At the time of the turbulence encounter, the two flight attendants (FA) in the forward galley and the one FA in the aft galley were injured. during the turbulence encounter and suffered. The aft FA was unconscious after the event and tended to by medical personnel passengers until landing. After being notified of the serious injuries, the flight crew declared an emergency with air traffic control and arranged for medical personnel to meet the aircraft at BIL. The three FAs were transported to the hospital. One FA was diagnosed with a fractured fibula; one was diagnosed with fractures of her scapula, a rib, cervical vertebrae, and thoracic vertebrae; and one was treated and released with minor injuries. According to the NTSB weather study, an Airman's Meteorological Information (AIRMET) for moderate turbulence for altitudes between FL270 and FL390 was issued at 0745 MST for a region that included the accident location. The flight dispatch release for the accident aircraft, which included weather information, included a Flight Planning Guidance product from WSI that advised of light/occasional moderate mountain wave activity between FL310 and FL390 close to where the accident occurred. Probable Cause: an encounter with severe mountain wave turbulence during cruise flight.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA14LA060 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  https://flightaware.com/live/flight/UAL1676/history/20140217/1815Z/KDEN/KBIL  NTSB File DCA14LA060 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  14 March 2016 N23708 United Airlines 0 Port Arthur, Texas non Turbulence Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates19-Feb-2014 10:10 whiteshark Added 19-Feb-2014 10:11 harro Updated [Location, Narrative, ]19-Feb-2014 17:19 Geno Updated [Time, Other fatalities, Location, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, ]19-Feb-2014 17:22 Geno Updated [Source, ]20-Feb-2014 06:20 Whiteshark Updated [Time, Narrative, ]03-Mar-2014 16:31 Geno Updated [Time, Phase, Source, Narrative, ]21-Dec-2016 19:28 ASN Update Bot Updated [Time, Damage, Category, Investigating agency, ]03-May-2020 18:58 ASN Update Bot Updated [Time, Operator, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, Accident report, ]05-May-2021 07:25 goldfish85 Updated [Location, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, ]09-May-2021 14:26 harro Updated [Total occupants, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The captain was Pilot Flying (PF). The en route part and descent towards Funchal (FNC), Madeira, were uneventful. There was a partially cloudy sky at Funchal with good visibility, surface wind was strong from 330Â° at 14 kts gusting to 24 kts, with variations in direction between 220Â° and 020Â°. Temperature was 15Â°C.  The commander reported that the visual approach to runway 05 seemed normal until the point Rosario, when he began to notice effects of ""wind shear"" and coincident with the automatic altitude call of 50 feet, the aircraft developed a high sink rate. The PF continued with the approach and he attempted to arrest the rate of descent but the aircraft landed heavily and bounced to a height of about 8 feet and continued for about 300 meters. During the second contact with the runway, the tail of the aircraft struck its surface at a speed of about 140 kts. The PF was able to control the aircraft safely within the confines of the runway. A preliminary visual inspection showed some deformation of the outer surface of the fuselage and significant skid marks on the underside of the rear fuselage. Closer inspection, performed by maintenance services, revealed the existence of a deformed drain tube, some bent struts with five cracks found on two fuselage frames that had suffered structural damage from the vertical loads sustained in the contact with the runway. CAUSE:  The accident was due to an excessive nose up input after the first contact with the runway and at a time in which the aircraft was airborne at around 8 feet (RA) which, associated to the manual deployment of the speedbrakes and consequent loss of lift, resulted in a sharp nose up attitude (9.15Â°) to a point of causing the tail strike with the runway surface. Contributing factors: 1. The Normal Checklist (Landing) was not executed (737-800 FCOM Chapter NP); 2. The aircraft approach was conducted under turbulence conditions in the last 150 feet; 3. Aircraft deviation from the ""stabilized approach"" profile which implied the execution of a go-around (737 NG FCTM Chapter 5); 4. The judgement not to execute a go-around after the bounce on the runway (737 NG FCTM Chapter 6);Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: GPIAA Report number: 02/ACCID/2014 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  30 December 1998 PH-HZC Transavia Airlines 0 Amsterdam-Schiphol Airport unk 21 July 2011 G-GDFC Jet2 0 Ibiza min Engine failure Location  Images: photo (c) Miklos SZABO; Budapest Ferenc Liszt International Airport (BUD/LHBP); 29 June 2012 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane was chartered by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) from 748 Air Services, that in turn chartered the plane from Global Airlift. The wing of the aircraft hit one of the gate posts at the airport. This fractured the wing and lead to a loss of fuel. The plane then scraped the tops of white vehicles that contained passengers' luggage. The impact with the cars caused the cars to ignite, as well as the plane. When it came to a halt one wing and an engine were still aflame. In a subsequent court case, it was revealed that the captain of the flight had bought seven bottles of beer and a bottle of gin in the night before the accident.

A steeper-than-usual climb was carried out to reduce exposure to turbulence. However, other than the expected turbulence during the first 1,500 ft, there was nothing significant during the climb to FL170. During cruise, the crew conducted a routine brief for the anticipated arrival to runway 16R, which was expected to be standard except for commencement of descent 5 NM (9 km) earlier than normal to compensate for a tailwind. The captain noted the need to be cognizant of managing airspeed during the descent as the anticipated decreasing tailwind would result in a temporary increase in the indicated airspeed. The first officer commenced descent into Sydney with the autopilot engaged in vertical speed mode and a target airspeed of 235 kt (15 kt less than the maximum operating speed of 250 kt). The descent was reported to have been initially stable and smooth. On first contact with Sydney Approach the crew were assigned runway 16L. This was different to the expected runway and required the crew to re-brief the approach and change the instrument approach diagrams and navigational aid frequencies. Passing 8,500 ft above mean sea level (AMSL), the crew noticed a rapid airspeed increase. The first officer reported that the airspeed trend indicator was 'off the chart', indicating a very rapid increase in airspeed. The first officer reduced engine power and used touch control steering to temporarily disconnect the autopilot before manually raising the aircraft's nose to control the speed. The first officer expected that, in combination, the pitch correction and power reduction would be sufficient to arrest the speed trend. The first officer reported that the aircraft felt 'heavy', as was normal for this aircraft at that speed, requiring two hands on the controls to move from the then -4Â° pitch angle.  The captain reported being unsure if the first officer's control inputs would be sufficient to avoid exceeding the maximum operating speed limitation, so put one of his hands on the controls and disconnected the autopilot to raise the nose further. Shortly after, with both flight crew making simultaneous nose up pitch inputs on the controls, the aircraft rapidly pitched up with an associated increase in the g load. The first officer responded by immediately reversing the control input to nose down. Both flight crew noticed that the controls suddenly felt different and 'spongy'. At about the same time, aural and visual cockpit warnings activated. The crew verified that the aircraft was under control at a stable attitude and speed, observing that it was level or in a slight descent at an airspeed of about 230 kt. One of the cockpit warnings was 'pitch disconnect', indicating that the left and right elevator control systems had uncoupled from each other. This allowed for independent movement of the left and right elevators via the captain's and first officer's control columns respectively. The crew consulted the pitch disconnect checklist and worked to identify which control column was free and working normally. After determining that both controls were free, it was decided that the captain would be pilot flying for the remainder of the approach and landing at Sydney Airport. The aerodynamic loads generated during the pitch disconnect resulted in serious injury to the senior cabin crew member and significant damage to the aircraft's horizontal stabiliser.  = Inspection = Two maintenance engineers were tasked to inspect the aircraft after landing. A readout of the aircraft systems computer revealed a maximum vertical load factor of 3.34 g at 16:41 hours. This load factor was abnormally high and prompted one of the engineers to discuss it with the crew, who were surprised about the high value. The crew added Âassociated with moderate turbulenceÂ to the maintenance log entry. Since this g-value was outside of the acceptable limits for the aircraft weight, the engineer he grounded the aircraft.   The applicable maintenance was determined to be the 'Inspection after flight in turbulence and/or exceeding VMO'. That evening a visual inspection was conducted of the wing, using an elevated platform. The engineer also used a torch to inspect the rear fuselage and tail. However, no high-access platform was available, so no close visual inspection was performed on the horizontal stabilizer.  Other maintenance was carried out the next morning, which consisted of among others an operational test of the pitch uncoupling mechanism re-engagement system. The aircraft was then released for service on 13:30 the day after the accident. Subsequent to the post-occurrence maintenance completed on 21 February 2014, the aircraft was operated on a further 13 flights. The respective flight crews did not record any anomalies or defects during their pre-flight inspections and there were no reports of any abnormal aircraft handling characteristics. = Feb 25 incident = On 25 February, aircraft VH-FVR was operated on a scheduled passenger flight from Sydney to Albury, NSW. On descent into Albury, the aircraft passed in close proximity to birds, which alerted the captain to the possibility of a birdstrike on the left side of the aircraft. There were no in-flight indications that a bird had struck the aircraft but after landing, the captain noticed the aircraftÂs pitch trim system fluctuated abnormally. The captain conducted a walk-around inspection and, although there was no evidence of a birdstrike on the left of the aircraft, he identified a dent in the top leading edge of the vertical stabiliser. The captain advised the operatorÂs maintenance watch who dispatched an engineer to Albury to inspect the aircraft. The engineer used scissor lift equipment to gain access to, and inspect the stabiliser. He did not find any evidence of a birdstrike, such as blood or feathers. However, the engineer did find indications of significant structural damage to the horizontal stabiliser, and contacted maintenance watch to cancel the following flights. Upon further examination and discussion with the airline, it became evident that the damage found at Albury was probably a consequence of the occurrence on 20 February. Findings: From the evidence available, the following findings are made regarding the in-flight upset and inadvertent pitch disconnect involving ATR 72 aircraft, VH-FVR on 20 February 2014 resulting in cabin crew injury and serious aircraft damage. A post-event maintenance inspection was carried out but the aircraft damage was not detected. Consequently, the aircraft was operated for another 13 flights over 5 days before the damage was identified. Contributing factors: - During the descent, when the sterile flight deck policy was applicable, the flight crew engaged in non-pertinent conversation. This distracted the crew and probably reduced their ability to monitor and respond to fluctuations of airspeed. - While passing through about 8,500 ft on descent into Sydney, the aircraft encountered a significant windshear that resulted in a rapidly decreasing tailwind. This led to a rapid increase in the airspeed, with the airspeed trend vector likely indicating well above the maximum operating speed (VMO). - Although the first officer (pilot flying) was in the process of attempting to control the airspeed, in response to the unexpectedly high airspeed trend indication, and their proximity to VMO, the captain (pilot not flying) perceived a need to immediately intervene, and made pitch control inputs before following the normal take-over procedure and alerting the first officer. - The addition of the captainÂs and first officerÂs nose-up control inputs resulted in a pitching manoeuvre that exceeded the limit load factor for the aircraft of 2.5 g. - The magnitude of the captain's nose-up control input was probably greater than he intended, due to his response to a high stress level, but increased the probability that the aircraft's limit load factor would be exceeded. - Shortly after the captain initiated the nose-up control inputs, the first officer reversed his control input. The differential forces in the left (captain) and right (first officer) pitch control systems were sufficiently large to inadvertently activate the pitch uncoupling mechanism, disconnecting the left and right pitch control systems. - Given the high airspeed, the asymmetric elevator deflections that occurred immediately following the pitch disconnect event resulted in aerodynamic loads on the tailplane that exceeded its strength and damaged the horizontal stabiliser. - The design of the ATR 72 pitch control system resulted in limited tactile feedback between the left and right control columns, reducing the ability of one pilot to detect that the other pilot is making control inputs. In addition, there were no visual or auditory systems to indicate dual control inputs.

The captain was Pilot Flying.  The en route part of the first leg was uneventful. Runway in use at Terceira-Lajes Airport was runway 15. There was a partially cloudy sky, good visibility, a strong surface wind from southwest (190Â° at 22 kts gusting to 32 kts), with direction variations between 160Â° and 230Â° and the air temperature was 15Â°C.  The commander reported that the visual approach to runway 15 seemed normal until 5 NM from touchdown. Winds were registered at a speed of up to 50 kts and there was severe turbulence along the entire approach.  Below 1000 feet the crew noticed effects of down-drafts and up-drafts, with huge variations in intensity until short final. The captain stated that he opted to maintain an angle of descent (G/S) above the recommended, due to severe turbulence and to ensure a safety margin. The entire approach was flown with Auto Thrust connected, for effective and accurate speed control.  The aircraft developed a high sink rate and lost speed instantly. This was counteracted by the captain with increasing power and attitude, in an attempt to stabilize the sink-rate. Touchdown occurred with a high rate of descent and a short flare, resulting in an impact on the main landing gear of 3.52 G vertical acceleration, followed by a bounce. A forward push of the control column by the pilot flying resulted in a pitch-down attitude of -1.9Â° with a second impact of 2.75 G vertical acceleration over the nose wheel causing substantial damage in that area of the aircraft fuselage. An inspection revealed the existence of some folded braces in the interior structure of the nose wheel bay with some bent struts, cracks found in fuselage frames that had suffered structural damage from the vertical loads applied in the contact with the runway. CAUSES:  1. Procedural The flight crew did not comply with aircraft manufacturer procedures and company SOPs, which required a ""go around"" manoeuvre; 2. Actuation The accident was due to an excessive control column forward input, causing aircraft negative pitch attitude which led to a very high impact loading on the nose undercarriage, leading to the severe damage of braces in the interior structure of the nose wheel bay, struts and fuselage frames. This followed a chain of events, which contributed to the accident including the wind gusts, turbulence, decision to fly above ILS G/P, the use of the A/T without A/P and the decision to land from an unstabilized final approach. The following were considered as contributing factors: 1. The aircraft approach was conducted under turbulent conditions; 2. The PF established an approach profile of one dot of scale above the nominal ILS G/S; 3. The PF did not disconnect the A/T after disengagement of the A/P; 4. Deviation from aircraft ""stabilized approach"" profile; 5. The PM did not provide the required call outs for the ""stabilized approach"" deviations.METAR: 07:00 UTC / 06:00 local time: LPLA 220700Z 19022G32KT 160V230 9999 FEW008 BKN012 14/13 Q1013=08:00 UTC / 07:00 local time: LPLA 220800Z 20018G28KT 9999 VCSH FEW008 BKN011 15/14 Q1011=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: GPIAA Report number: 04/ACCID/2014 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Contributing Factors: - Malfunction of aircraft radio altimeter. - Flight crew fatigue. - Lack of enough supervision on flight calibration operationsAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Iran Report number: A13921212EPFIC Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: CAO Iran   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were 227 passengers and 12 crew members on board. The Boeing 777-2H6ER took off from Kuala Lumpur International Airport's runway 32R at 00:41. At 00:42 the flight was cleared to climb to FL180 and was issued a direct track by Lumpur Approach to the IGARI waypoint. MH370 was then transferred to Lumpur Radar and was cleared to climb to FL250. At 00:50 the flight was further cleared to the planned cruising altitude of FL350. MH370 reported maintaining FL350 at 01:07. Last radio contact was at 01:19 when the Kuala Lumpur Radar controller instructed the flight to contact the radio frequency of Ho Chi Minh Air Traffic Control Centre, Vietnam: ""Malaysian Three Seven Zero contact Ho Chi Minh 120 decimal 9 Good Night"". One of the flight crew members replied: ""Good night, Malaysian Three Seven Zero.""  At 01:21 MH370 was observed on the radar screen of the Kuala Lumpur Radar controller as it passed over waypoint IGARI. Nine seconds later the radar label for MH370 disappeared from the radar screen. The transponder was switched off.  At 01:38 Ho Chi Minh ATCC contacted Kuala Lumpur ATCC on the whereabouts of MH370. Kuala Lumpur ATCC contacted the airline's operations centre, Singapore ACC, Hong Kong ACC, and Phnom Penh ACC, failing to establish the location of MH370. Meanwhile, the airplane flew in a westerly direction back over peninsular Malaysia before turning northwest. Primary radar data showed that the aircraft tracked along the Malacca Strait. During this time the aircraft passed close to waypoints VAMPI, MEKAR, NILAM and possibly IGOGU along a section of airway N571. The final primary radar fix occurred at 02:22. From then on seven handshakes between the aircraft's SATCOM system and the Inmarsat ground station were recorded. Last satellite data was recorded at 08:11 Malaysian time. Initially search efforts focused on the South China Sea area. On 24 March 2014 further analysis of the Inmarsat satellite data indicated that MH370 flew south and ended its flight in the southern part of the Indian Ocean.  A surface search was conducted of probable impact areas along an arc, identified by calculations based on Inmarsat data. The search was carried out from 18 March - 28 April 2014. This search effort was undertaken by an international fleet of aircraft and ships with the search areas over this time progressing generally from an initial southwest location along the arc in a north-easterly direction. No debris associated with MH370 was identified either from the surface search, acoustic search or from the ocean floor search in the vicinity of acoustic detections, which were initially believed to have been from the pingers on the flight recorders. The ocean floor search was completed on 28 May 2014. On June 26 the ATSB published a new search area based on refinements to the analysis of both the flight and satellite data. The priority area of approximately 60,000 km2 extends along the arc for 650 km in a northeast direction from Broken Ridge, an underwater ridge. The width of the priority search area is 93 km. On July 29, 2015 a flapperon washed ashore on the French island of RÃ©union in the Indian Ocean. On August 5 it was established to have been from MH370. The Team is unable to determine the real cause for the disappearance of MH370.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MH370 Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 years and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: mh370search.com  DCA Malaysia  ATC Transcript  Malaysia Airlines History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  9 August 2012 9M-MRO Malaysia Airlines 0 Shanghai-Pudong International Airport (PVG/ZSPD) sub Location  Images: photo (c) ATSB; 20 July 2016 photo (c) ATSB photo (c) ATSB photo (c) ATSB photo (c) ATSB photo (c) ATSB photo (c) Mark Ijsseldijk; Tokyo-Narita Airport (NRT/RJAA); 25 August 2010 photo (c) Stanley Page; Frankfurt International Airport (FRA/EDDF); 28 September 2013 photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Newark-Liberty International Airport, NJ (EWR/KEWR); January 2004 photo (c) Stemoc; Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG/LFPG); 26 December 2011 photo (c) Ahmet Akin Diler; Istanbul-AtatÃ¼rk International Airport (IST/LTBA); 02 December 2009 photo (c) Joao Ponces; Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KUL/WMKK); 04 April 2013 photo (c) Paul Rowbotham; Los Angeles International Airport, CA (LAX/KLAX); October 2013 photo (c) Willem GÃ¶ebel; Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS/EHAM); 03 February 2013 photo (c) Wolfgang Bergemann; Tokyo-Narita Airport (NRT/RJAA); 11 December 2006 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates04-Jan-2025 11:16 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Before pushback from the gate, the first officer, who was the pilot monitoring, initialized the flight management computer (FMC) and mistakenly entered the incorrect departure runway (27R instead of the assigned 27L). As the captain taxied onto runway 27L for departure, he noticed that the wrong runway was entered in the FMC. The captain asked the first officer to correct the runway entry in the FMC, which she completed about 27 seconds before the beginning of the takeoff roll; however, she did not enter the FLEX temperature (a reduced takeoff thrust setting) for the newly entered runway or upload the related V-speeds. As a result, the FMC's ability to execute a FLEX power takeoff was invalidated, and V-speeds did not appear on the primary flight display (PFD) or the multipurpose control display unit during the takeoff roll.  Once the airplane was cleared for takeoff on runway 27L, the captain set FLEX thrust with the thrust levers, and he felt that the performance and acceleration of the airplane on the takeoff roll was normal. About 2 seconds later, as the airplane reached about 56 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS), the flight crew received a single level two caution chime and an electronic centralized aircraft monitoring (ECAM) message indicating that the thrust was not set correctly. The first officer called ""engine thrust levers not set."" According to the operator's pilot handbook, in response to an ""engine thrust levers not set"" ECAM message, the thrust levers should be moved to the takeoff/go-around (TO/GA) detent. However, the captain responded by saying ""they're set"" and moving the thrust levers from the FLEX position to the CL (climb) detent then back to the FLEX position. As the airplane continued to accelerate, the first officer did not make a callout at 80 KIAS, as required. As the airplane reached 86 KIAS, the automated RETARD aural alert sounded and continued until the end of the CVR recording. According to Airbus, the RETARD alert is designed to occur at 20 ft radio altitude on landing and advise the pilot to reduce the thrust levers to idle. The captain later reported that he had never heard an aural RETARD alert on takeoff, only knew of it on landing, and did not know what it was telling him. He further said that when the RETARD aural alert sounded, he did not plan to reject the takeoff because they were in a high-speed regime, they had no red warning lights, and there was nothing to suggest that the takeoff should be rejected.  The first officer later reported that there were no V-speeds depicted on the PFD and, thus, she could not call V1 or VR during the takeoff. She was not aware of any guidance or procedure that recommended rejecting or continuing a takeoff when there were no V-speeds displayed. The captain stated that he had recalled the V-speeds as previously briefed from the Taxi checklist, which happened to be the same V-speeds for runway 27L. The captain continued the takeoff roll despite the lack of displayed V-speeds, no callouts from the first officer, and the continued and repeated RETARD aural alert.  The airplane rotated at 164 KIAS. The captain had ""the perception the aircraft was unsafe to fly"" and that he decided ""the safest action was not to continue,"" so he commenced a rejected takeoff. FDR data indicate that the captain reduced the engines to idle and made an airplane-nose-down input as the airplane reached 167 KIAS (well above the V1 speed of 157 KIAS) and achieved a 6.7 degree nose-high attitude. The airplane's pitch decreased until the nosegear contacted the runway. However, the airplane then bounced back into the air and achieved a radio altitude of about 15 ft. The tail of the airplane then struck the runway surface, followed by the main landing gear then the nose landing gear, resulting in its fracture. The airplane slid to its final resting position on the left side of runway 27L. The operator's SOPs address the conditions under which a rejected takeoff should be performed within both low-speed (below 80 KIAS) and high-speed (between 80 KIAS and V1) regimes but provide no guidance for rejecting a takeoff after V1 and rotation. Simulator testing performed after the accident demonstrated that increasing the thrust levers to the TO/GA detent, as required by SOPs upon the activation of the ""thrust not set"" ECAM message, would have silenced the RETARD aural alert.  At the time of the accident, neither the operator's training program nor manuals provided to flight crews specifically addressed what to do in the event the RETARD alert occurred during takeoff; although, 9 months before the accident, US Airways published a safety article regarding the conditions under which the alert would activate during takeoff. The operator's postaccident actions include a policy change (published via bulletin) to its pilot handbook specifying that moving the thrust levers to the TO/GA detent will cancel the RETARD aural alert. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The captain's decision to reject the takeoff after the airplane had rotated. Contributing to the accident was the flight crew's failure to follow standard operating procedures by not verifying that the airplane's flight management computer was properly configured for takeoff and the captain's failure to perform the correct action in response to the electronic centralized aircraft monitoring alert.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA14MA081 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Flightglobal  CNN  FAA  BEA   Location  Images: photo (c) Rafal Szczypek; Philadelphia International Airport, PA (PHL/KPHL); 28 February 2016 photo (c) Colin Pierce; Philadelphia International Airport, PA (PHL/KPHL); 03 June 2018 photo (c) Jack Goldberg; Philadelphia International Airport, PA (PHL/KPHL); 04 August 2018 photo (c) Paul Kanagie; Philadelphia International Airport, PA (PHL/KPHL); 23 January 2021 photo (c) Paul Kanagie; Philadelphia International Airport, PA (PHL/KPHL); 23 January 2021 photo (c) NTSB; 2014; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; 2014; (publicdomain) photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Washington-Ronald Reagan National Airport, DC (DCA/KDCA); 17 October 2012 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Examination of the 4,954-feet-long runway revealed that the airplane touched down about 1,400 feet from the approach end. Skid marks were visible for about 2,982 feet, and the tire failure occurred about 3,153 feet into the landing. Examinations revealed that the right main landing gear tire had a flat spot with a 4-inch diameter hole consistent with a locked brake. The airplane was equipped with an optional antiskid wheel braking system; however, it was disabled in 2004. The pilots reported that they decided to land on runway 36 based on the wind at flight level 180 and that they did not check the surface wind at the airport. The surface wind at the airport at the time of the accident was from 158 degrees at 15 knots gusting to 25 knots. Thus, the airplane landed with a significant quartering tailwind, which resulted in it touching down at a location and speed at which the pilots were unable to stop the airplane on the runway using normal braking. The pilots' inadequate in-flight planning and improper selection of runway 36 for landing, which resulted in a significant quartering tailwind during the landing, exceedance of the airplane's braking capability, and a subsequent runway overrun.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA14LA159 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All ten occupants survived the accident. The aircraft was used to fly the Governor of Haryana from Chandigarh to Delhi. In addition to the pilot and co-pilot there were 8 passengers. The baggage on board was approx. 50 lbs. There was 2100 lbs. of fuel on board. After boarding of the passengers, the aircraft engines were started at 11:30 hrs. The aircraft taxied out via taxiway D. After ATC departure clearance the aircraft was lined up for take-off. On clearance from ATC the take off roll was initiated and all the parameters were found normal. The rotation was initiated at 98 knots and the aircraft climbed to 10-15 feet AGL. The commander has stated that after lift-off, immediately the left rudder got locked in the forward position resulting in the aircraft yawing and rolling to left. The pilots tried to control it with right bank but the aircraft could not be controlled. Within 3-4 seconds of getting airborne the aircraft impacted the ground in a left bank attitude. The initial impact was on pucca (tar road) and the wing took the first impact loads. After the aircraft came to final halt, the co-pilot opened the door and evacuation was carried out. There was no injury to any of the occupants. Probable cause of the accident: The accident occurred due to stalling of left wing of the aircraft at a very low height. The contributory factors were: - Failure on the part of the crew to effectively put off the yaw damp so as to release the rudder stiffness as per the emergency checklist. - Checklist not being carried out by the crew members. - Not putting off the Rudder Boost. - Speeds call outs not made by co-pilot. - Not abandoning the take-off at lower speed (before V1). - Failure of CRM in the cockpit in case of emergency. - Early rotation and haste to take-off.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB India Report number: 2014-ACC-0 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) Ashishbhatnagar72; Delhi-Safdarjung Airport (/VIDD) [VT]; 30 January 2012; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Flight OC 6393 was a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Petrolina to BrasÃ­lia. While en route, thirty minutes after takeoff, the no.1 hydraulic system showed a loss in pressure. During the approach to BrasÃ­lia, the flight crew used the alternative system for lowering the undercarriage. The main landing gears lowered and locked, but the nose landing gear did not lower. After coordination with the air traffic control, the aircraft was instructed to land on runway 11R. After the touchdown, the aircraft covered a total distance of 900 meters until its full stop. The initial 750 meters were with the aircraft supported only by the main landing gears and the last 150 meters were with the aircraft supported by the main landing gears and by the lower part of the front fuselage. The aircraft stopped on the runway. The aircraft suffered substantial damage to structural elements of the aircraft near the nose section. Contributing factors. - Aircraft maintenance - undetermined. It was found that there was a restriction on the articulation movement of the right nose landing gear door and that the weight of this landing gear was not sufficient to overcome such restriction. Upon inspecting the hinges, it was found that there were no signs of recent lubrication, allowing the hypothesis of occurrence of any deviation or non-adherence to the inspection and lubrication requirements established by the manufacturer leading to a the scenario favorable to the right door movement restriction.  The issue of the maintenance could also be related to some deviation, or nonadherence to the requirements established for the service of widening the holes of the hinges concerning the coating and corrosion protection of the worked surface. As a result, the area could have been more susceptible to corrosive processes. - Project - undetermined. The maintenance program, established by the manufacturer, may have contributed to the occurrence by not establishing adequate preventive maintenance parameters for the landing gear doors that were modified by reworking the hinges, incorporating larger radial pins and widening the lobe holes. - Other - undetermined. It was not possible to determine the causal root of the EDP1 gasket extrusion, which caused the leakage of hydraulic oil that caused the hydraulic system 1 to fail.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CENIPA Report number: A-066/CENIPA/2014 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Onderzoeksraad voor de Veiligheid  G1 Globo History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  11 July 2008 PR-OAF OceanAir 0 SÃ£o Paulo/Guarulhos International Airport (GRU/SBGR), SÃ£o Paulo min Tire failure 21 January 2012 PR-OAF Avianca Brasil 0 near BrasÃ­lia, DF min Fumes/smoke/odor event Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates15-Mar-2024 19:49 ASN Updated [Accident report, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

A post-crash fire erupted. Both pilots were killed. The flight was intended to be the first training flight of the newly hired second-in-command (SIC) pilot. The SIC was operating from the airplane's right seat during the training. The airplane departed Bethel Airport, Alaska, at 15:35. After departure, the airplane began a series of training maneuvers, consistent with normal operations. About 21 minutes into the flight, when the airplane was about 3,400 ft mean sea level, it began a steep descent and subsequently impacted terrain. An airplane performance study showed that the airplane reached a nose-down pitch of about -40 degrees and that the descent rate reached about 16,000 ft per minute.  The NTSB determined that it is likely that the check airman simulated a pitch trim excursion and that the trainee, who lacked experience in the airplane type, did not appropriately respond to the excursion. The check airman did not take remedial action and initiate the recovery procedure in time to prevent the control forces from becoming unmanageable and to ensure that recovery from the associated dive was possible. The aircraft impacted frozen tundra and came to rest in an area of heavy willows.

The aircraft was parked at stand J10 at terminal 2G and was ready for a flight bound for Clermont-Ferrand Airport. The apron management services agent asked the flight to be pushed back facing east. The crew of the airplane parked at J11 then also requested pushback. In order to allow this airplane to start its manoeuvre sooner, the apron management services agent then asked the crew of F-HBLF to be towed, with the assistance of a tug, after its pushback, facing south until abeam stand 12 at the end of their pushback.  During the pushback, the crew of F-HBLF started the airplane's two engines, which stabilised at ground idle. Following the pushback from J10, the airplane was on the axis specified in the documentation. In order to position the airplane on the centreline of taxiway E7, the tug driver had to make the airplane make a turn of about 90Â° with a short turn radius. To do this, he positioned his tug at approximately 90Â° to the airplane axis. When the tug began to pull the aircraft, the safety cotter pins on the tow bar coupling head broke. The coupling head was then only connected to the tow bar by an axle around which it could pivot horizontally. Under the effect of its inertia and the thrust of the two engines at idle, the aircraft continued to advance in a straight line. When the coupling head reached the stop, the airplane pivoted towards the right and collided with the tug. This specific pushback and towing procedure was prohibited for stand J10 following two similar previous occurrences. LESSONS LEARNED AND CONCLUSION: The apron management services agent asked that the pushback be followed by a pull forward with the assistance of the tug, despite the ban in the apron management services operations manual on carrying out this manoeuvre on departure from stand J10. The common use of this manoeuvre at the other stands and the absence of any explanation of the reasons for the ban at that specific stand likely led the apron management services agent to request a non-standard procedure. The tug driver did not question the request from the apron management services agent and repeated by the crew of F-HBLF. The operating instructions in fact specify that the latter are ""according to the instructions from ATC and validation by the aircraft captain"". In order to be able to pull the aeroplane, the driver had to set an excessive angle between the tow bar and the aeroplaneÂs axis. The link between the tug and the aeroplane then broke. The aeroplaneÂs inertia following its being moved and the thrust from its engines at idle made the aeroplane move forward, which led to the collision with the tug. Following this event, the apron management services operations manual was modified to make clear the reasons for the ban.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Report number: f-lf140419.en Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) Google Earth; Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG); 14 April 2015 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight to Kikori was uneventful. The pilot stated that he joined the Kikori circuit upwind for a left downwind and, after completing the pre-landing checks, set up for a landing on runway 30. The pilot reported that, after touchdown, he held the nose wheel off the ground. He stated that the initial landing and roll-through on the steel matting surface were normal. When applying brakes, the aircraft veered left and ran off the runway.  The aircraft subsequently impacted an embankment beyond the left side of the runway, approximately 70 metres from the runway end. The nose of the aircraft was crushed and the nose landing gear partially collapsed rearwards during the impact with the embankment. Two of the left propeller blades were bent. Based on the differences between the pilotÂs statements and the statement by the witness, the AIC was unable to ascertain the exact touchdown point.  Prior to the accident flight, the aircraft had undergone a 100-hourly maintenance check at Port Moresby performed by the operatorÂs maintenance provider. The AIC was informed that during this check the brake pads had been changed and the brake system had been bled and refilled with hydraulic fluid. The AIC's on-site investigation of the brake system did not reveal any defects in the system, however, the aircraft had been moved after the accident by the operator's personnel and the AIC was unable to determine to what extent the condition of the aircraft and its systems had changed in the time between the accident and the AIC's arrival at Kikori.

The aircraft was scheduled to operate three commercial air transport (cargo) sectors: from Athens to Bergamo, then to Paris Charles de Gaulle, and finally East Midlands. The co-pilot completed the pre-flight external inspection of the aircraft in good light, and found nothing amiss. The departure from Athens was uneventful, but a combination of factors affecting Bergamo (including poor weather, absence of precision approach aids, and work in progress affecting the available landing distance) led the crew to decide to route directly to Paris, where a normal landing was carried out. The aircraft departed Paris for East Midlands at 00:40 hrs UTC, loaded with 10 tonnes of freight, 8 tonnes of fuel (the minimum required was 5.6 tonnes), and with the co-pilot as Pilot Flying. Once established in the cruise, the flight crew obtained the latest ATIS information from East Midlands, which stated that runway 27 was in use, although there was a slight tailwind, and Low Visibility Procedures (LVPs) were in force. They planned to exchange control at about FL100 in the descent, for the commander to carry out a Category III autoland. However, as they neared their destination, the weather improved, LVPs were cancelled, and the flight crew re-briefed for an autopilot approach, followed by a manual landing, to be carried out by the co-pilot. The landing was to be with Flap 30, Autobrake 2, and idle reverse thrust. The final ATIS transmission which the flight crew noted before landing stated that the wind was 130/05 kt, visibility was 3,000 metres in mist, and the cloud was broken at 600 ft aal. The captain established radio contact with the tower controller, and the aircraft was cleared to land; the surface wind was transmitted as 090/05 kt. The touchdown was unremarkable, and the autobrake functioned normally, while the co-pilot applied idle reverse thrust on the engines. As the aircraftÂs speed reduced through approximately 60 kt, the co-pilot handed control to the commander, who then made a brake pedal application to disengage the autobrake system. However, the system remained engaged, so he made a second, more positive, brake application. The aircraft ""shuddered"" and rolled slightly left-wing-low as the lower part of the left main landing gear detached. The captain used the steering tiller to try to keep the aircraft tracking straight along the runway centreline, but it came to a halt slightly off the centreline, resting on its right main landing gear, the remains of the left main landing gear leg, and the left engine lower cowl.  The two crew members were uninjured and there was no fire. Conclusions: The damage to the flap system, fuselage, and MLG equipment was attributable to the detachment of the left MLG axle, wheel and brake assembly. The damage to the MLG outer cylinder, engine and nacelle was as result of the aircraft settling and sliding along the runway. The left MLG axle assembly detached from the inner cylinder due to the momentary increase in bending load during the transition from auto to manual braking. The failure was as a result of stress corrosion cracking and fatigue weakening the high strength steel substrate at a point approximately 75 mm above the axle. It is likely that some degree of heat damage was sustained by the inner cylinder during the overhaul process, as indicated by the presence of chicken wire cracking within the chrome plating over the majority of its surface. However, this was not severe enough to have damaged the steel substrate and therefore may have been coincidental. Although the risk of heat damage occurring during complex landing gear plating and refinishing processes is well understood and therefore mitigated by the manufacturers and overhaul agencies, damage during the most recent refinishing process cannot be discounted. The origin of the failure was an area of intense, but very localised heating, which damaged the chrome protection and changed the metallurgy; ie the formation of martensite within the steel substrate. This resulted in a surface corrosion pit, which, along with the metallurgical change, led to stress corrosion cracking, fatigue propagation and the eventual failure of the inner cylinder under normal loading.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: EW/C2014/04/03 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  25 January 2011 VH-TJH Qantas 0 between Adelaide and Melbourne non Location  Images: photo (c) Richard Blower; East Midlands Airport (EMA/EGNX); 29 April 2014 photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Sydney-Kingsford Smith International Airport, NSW (SYD/YSSY); 04 January 2009 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All occupants sustained fatal injuries. The aircraft, HK-4700, operated on a non-scheduled cargo flight from Villavicencio (VVC) to Florencia (FLA). The takeoff weight was 11,430 kg which included a cargo of 2540 kg. A VFR flight plane was filed with an en route altitude of 6500 feet.  Takeoff was accomplished at 11:15 hours local time. Last radio contact with the flight was at 11:44 hours when the crew reported abeam Uribe. As the flight progressed, visibility deteriorated due to clouds and the crew had difficulty maintaining visual flight. The airplane deviated to the west of the planned route in order to remain visual. This took the flight over mountains with an elevation higher than the en route altitude of the aircraft. After losing visual contact with the ground, the airplane impacted the wooded side of a mountain at about 6500 feet.

According to the flight crew, duringÂ pushback theyÂ received a new route clearance due to weather along the route.Â  The captain and first officer discussed how they would handle the associated tasks, and agreed they would load the new route and thenÂ contact dispatch after the engine startÂ had been accomplished.Â  The crew stated the interphone conversation quality was degraded due to low volume, and there was considerable radio traffic on both clearance delivery and ramp frequencies.Â  As the flight crew finished coordinating tasks, the captain heard on the interphone what he believed was ""set brakes"" and, because he did not discern any aircraft motion,Â began to apply the brakes.Â  The airplane immediately shook and several warnings went off in cockpit.Â   According to the tug operator,Â while at the gate he received brakes released andÂ clear to push from the flight crew, and heÂ proceeded to push the airplane off of the gate and to the area where it was clear to start engines.Â  As they airplane approached the engine start spot,Â  the tug operator stated ""cleared to start"", and the airplane immediately stopped, and the tug operator saw the airplane nose immediately drop and the nose gear partially collapse.Â  Further inspection revealed the airplane sustained substantial damage to the nose landing gear assembly. Probable Cause: the captain's failure to verify the communications between himself and the tug operator, which resulted in him applying of brakes while the airplane was being pushed back from the gate by the tug with tow bar attached.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA14CA093 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 years and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA14CA093  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates06-Oct-2022 17:18 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

According to the operator, the captain was the pilot flying and the first officer (FO) was the pilot monitoring. Both pilots indicated that takeoff through the initial descent was uneventful. The aircraft was configured for a flaps 30 landing. During the ILS approach to runway 25L, the captain used the Heads-up Guidance System (HGS) in the IMC mode.  During the decent below 100 feet, the FO indicated that the runway environment was dark and sensed the runway was ""coming close fast"". He noted a slightly increased descent rate and before he could make a callout, the captain had begun to take corrective action.  During the descent, the captain stated he was hand flying the airplane (autopilot and autothrottles were off) and used the localizer, glideslope and flare cues from the HGS. At approximately 30 feet, he transitioned from the HGS to the runway environment, noting it appeared ""pitch black."" He then noticed the runway edge lights and what appeared to be an increased sink rate. Both pilots indicated the airplane touched down firm, then bounced, and the second touch down was harder than the first. Neither were aware that they had struck the tail. The captain did not recall seeing a tail strike warning indication from the HGS. Post flight inspection revealed that the tail strike indicator was compressed and deep scrapes and wear damage to the lower aft fuselage skin. Further investigation revealed multiple fractured frames and buckled stringers, shear ties and straps. The airplane was ferried unpressurized from Las Vegas to Phoenix, AZ (PHX) on January 13 and continued the next day to Seattle-Paine Field, WA. The airplane was repaired and back in service on February 27.

Flight 890 was a domestic service from Imphal to Guwahati and Delhi in India. The aircraft landed at Guwahati at 11:15 UTC and departed for Delhi at 12:05 UTC with 12.7 tonnes of fuel on board. The filed alternates for the sector were Lucknow and Jaipur in that order.  Overhead Lucknow, the crew received the Lucknow weather and when the aircraft was in range the Delhi ATIS weather was also copied. While in contact with Delhi ATC, the flight was advised to join the hold as the runway 28 RVR at Delhi had dropped to the lower end of CAT I operations. At this point runway 29 was below minima. AI890 was number twelve in sequence and continued to remain in the holding pattern for the next 20-25 minutes. During this period there was no attempt on the part of flight crew to seek Lucknow weather. Air India Flight dispatch also did not given any advice to the flight about Jaipur or Lucknow weather. The weather (visibility / RVR) reported on runway 29 was below CAT I conditions so runway was not available for this flight at that moment as the First Officer was only Cat I qualified. The aircraft flew 3 holds before intercepting the localizer runway 28 at 35 miles. RVR runway 28 also dropped below Cat. I minimas, therefore the crew discontinued approach and climbed to 8000 feet on runway heading before going on heading 180. Though the first planned diversion alternate was Lucknow, which had visibility of 2000 m (above minima), the captain elected to divert to Jaipur. Reason was that they were closer to Jaipur and they had inquired about the visibility from Dispatch for Jaipur, which was provided as 2000 m. At this stage the crew did not check complete weather of Jaipur. Minimum diversion fuel to Jaipur was 2.9 tonnes. AI890 commenced diversion to Jaipur with Fuel on Board of 3.1 tonnes.  The aircraft came in contact with Jaipur for the first time when it was at 68 DME from Jaipur. At that time the crew came to know of the complete weather of Jaipur from the ATIS, which read: visibility of 900 m, dew point 13Â°C, temperature 13Â°C, and RVR 1000m. At 60 miles and passing flight level 138, the crew informed Jaipur that the aircraft was descending for flight level 100 as cleared by Delhi control. The aircraft again informed Jaipur ATC its position at 55 miles, 50 miles and 42 miles from Jaipur which were also acknowledged by Jaipur ATC. During these contacts, weather of Jaipur was neither asked by the crew nor provided by ATC. When the aircraft was at flight level 83, the crew asked ATC Jaipur to confirm that they could carry out an ILS approach for runway 27 via the 10 DME arc. While confirming the requested approach, Jaipur ATC informed all the stations about the weather at that moment as visibility 400 m and RVR 1000 m. When the aircraft was at 30 miles from Jaipur, Jaipur ATC passed weather as visibility 400 m, RVR 1000 m and trend visibility becoming 350 m. At 28 DME from Jaipur, the aircraft was maintaining 6000 feet and on request was cleared by Jaipur ATC to descend to 5000 feet. When the aircraft was at 25 DME, from Jaipur, ATC advised that the weather was deteriorating rapidly and visibility was 400 meters. The crew however informed ATC that they were committed to land at Jaipur due to the aircraft fuel state. The fuel on board at that point of time was approx 2.6 tonnes and approach was commenced for Jaipur with a visibility of 500 m with trend reducing. The aircraft was no. 2 in approach at Jaipur and was cleared for the VOR/DME arc ILS approach runway 27 at 25 nm.  Due to reducing visibility, Jaipur ATC asked all the aircraft inbound for Jaipur to come over head and join the JJP hold. The crew of AI890 asked for the weather which was provided as visibility 400 m and RVR 1000 m though RVR deteriorating to 550 m. The flight continued and flew the VOR/DME arc for an ILS runway 27 approach. ATC transmitted the RVR as 200 m and visibility as 50 m with trend reducing. Another scheduled flight ahead of AI890 carried out a missed approach and diverted to Ahmedabad. When the aircraft was above MDA (1480 feet AGL), ATC reported RVR 50 m and cleared the aircraft to land subject to minima. Both the flight crew maintained that they had seen the runway lights. The ILS approach was performed with dual auto pilot until 200ft Radio Altitude. After descending below MDA on auto pilot, the commander disconnected the auto pilot. The captain performed the final approach manually. The aircraft deviated to the left of the runway centre line and touched down on soft ground (in kutcha) on the left hand side of the runway. During touchdown and landing roll, the visibility was zero and crew were unable to see any of the reference cues. The crew had heard rumbling sound during landing roll. The commander stated that he did the manual landing as he was not sure if he could do an auto-land on a ground facility which is CAT I certified airfield in actual zero visibility. The aircraft continued to roll/ skid on the unpaved surface and during this period the left wing impacted trees causing damage to the left wing. Thereafter aircraft turned right and entered the runway finally coming to a halt on the left hand side of runway. There was no fire. The aircraft was disabled on the runway, forcing the following flight (a SpiceJet Boeing 737-800, flight SG256) to carry out a missed approach. That flight was already low on fuel after diverting from Delhi to Jaipur, just like AI890. The captain of SG256 then decided to return to Delhi irrespective of reported visibility and RVR. After diverting to Delhi, the aircraft came in contact with ATC Delhi, declared a MAYDAY due fuel with a request for straight and short vector for ILS 28. During the ILS approach for runway 28, the tower had reported RVR for runway 28 as 375m/900m/50m. A dual channel auto land was carried out.  Fuel remaining at that time was 400 kgs. Fuel remaining during engine shut down was 150 kgs. PROBABLE CAUSE: The cause below has been given considering events as a combination of organizational factors and human error. - The flight crew made an erroneous decision of diverting & continuing to an airfield with reducing visibility. - The flight crew attempted a manual landing in below minima conditions. - Lack of operational supervision and desired ground support to flight. - Internal quality assurance not capturing the hazards which slipped through due complacency - Lack of oversight of the flight operations.METAR: 14:30 UTC / 20:00 local time: VIDP 051430Z 00000KT 0050 R28/0800 R29/0200 FG VV/// 11/11 Q1013 NOSIGDelhi14:30 UTC / 20:00 local time: VIJP 051430Z VRB00KT 0900 R27/1500D MIFG NSC 13/13 Q1014 BECMG 0800Jaipur15:30 UTC / 21:00 local time: VIDP 051530Z 00000KT 0000 R28/0450 R10/0050 R29/0000 R11/0050 FG VV/// 09/09 Q1014 NOSIGDelhi16:00 UTC / 21:30 local time: VIDP 051600Z 00000KT R28/0450 R29/0000 R10/0040 R11/0000 FG VV/// 08/08 Q1014 NOSIGDelhi16:30 UTC / 22:00 local time: VIJP 051630Z 00000KT 0000 R27/0150 FG NSC 13/13 Q1015 NOSIGJaipurAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB India Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Singapore-Changi International Airport (SIN/WSSS); 24 December 2005 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The copilot was fatally injured; the captain and the passenger received serious injuries. The flight originated from the Tucson International Airport (TUS), Arizona, at 10:04 and was bound for Aspen. The departure and en route portions of the flight were uneventful. As the flight neared its destination, a high-altitude, terrain-limited airport, air traffic control (ATC) provided vectors to the localizer/distance measuring equipment (LOC/DME)-E approach to runway 15. About 12:10, the local controller informed the flight crew that the wind was from 290Âº at 19 knots (kts) with gusts to 25 kts. About 12:11, the flight crew reported that they were executing a missed approach and then requested vectors for a second approach. ATC vectored the airplane for a second LOC/DME-E approach to runway 15. About 12:21, the local controller informed the flight crew that the wind was from 330Â° at 16 kts and the 1-minute average wind was from 320Â° at 14 kts gusting to 25 kts. The initial part of the airplane's second approach was as-expected for descent angle, flap setting, and spoilers. During the final minute of flight, the engines were advanced and retarded five times, and the airplane's airspeed varied between 135 kts and 150 kts. The final portion of the approach to the runway was not consistent with a stabilized approach. The airplane stayed nose down during its final descent and initial contact with the runway. The vertical acceleration and pitch parameters were consistent with the airplane pitch oscillating above the runway for a number of seconds before a hard runway contact, a gain in altitude, and a final impact into the runway at about 6 g. The weather at the time of the accident was near or in exceedance of the airplane's maximum tailwind and crosswind components for landing, as published in the airplane flight manual. Given the location of the airplane over the runway when the approach became unstabilized and terrain limitations of Aspen, performance calculations were completed to determine if the airplane could successfully perform a go-around. Assuming the crew had control of the airplane, and that the engines were advanced to the appropriate climb setting, anti-ice was off, and tailwinds were less than a sustained 25 kts, the airplane had the capability to complete a go-around, clearing the local obstacles along that path. Both flight crewmembers had recently completed simulator training for a type rating in the CL-600 airplane. The captain reported that he had a total of 12 to 14 hours of total flight time in the airplane type, including the time he trained in the simulator. The copilot would have had close to the same hours as the captain given that they attended flight training together. Neither flight crew member would have met the minimum flight time requirement of 25 hours to act as pilot-in-command under Part 135. The accident flight was conducted under Part 91, and therefore, the 25 hours requirement did not apply to this portion of their trip. Nevertheless, the additional flight time would have increased the crew's familiarity with the airplane and its limitation and likely improved their decision-making during the unstabilized approach. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The flight crew's failure to maintain airplane control during landing following an unstabilized approach. Contributing to the accident were the flight crew's decision to land with a tailwind above the airplane's operating limitations and their failure not to conduct a go-around when the approach became unstabilized.""METAR: 18:53 UTC / 11:53 local time: KASE 051853Z 31009G28KT 270V360 9SM HZ FEW035 BKN046 OVC050 M11/M20 A3007 RMK AO2 PK WND 33028/1851 SLP243 T11111200 $Wind 310 degrees at 9 knots, gusting to 28 knots; wind variable between 270 and 360 degrees; Visibility: 9 miles in haze; few clouds at 3500 feet AGL, broken clouds at 4600 feet AGL, overcast cloud deck at 5000 feet AGL; Temperature: -11Â°C, Dew point -20Â°C; pressure 30.07 inches Hg.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN14FA099 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Flightaware flight route  LiveATC (audio file of Aspen Tower ATC)  Private jet crashes Aspen Airport; 1 dead, 2 hurt (KABC)  Flightaware accident info  ABC News  NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Aspen-Pitkin County Airport, CO (ASE); January 2014; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Aspen-Pitkin County Airport, CO (ASE); January 2014; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Aspen-Pitkin County Airport, CO (ASE); January 2014; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Aspen-Pitkin County Airport, CO (ASE); January 2014; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

When preparing for landing in MED, the flight crew lowered the landing gear but the right main landing gear did not lower into the extended position. The flight crew notified the MED Air Traffic Control Tower of the discrepancy. The flight crew attempted to use the alternate procedure to lower the right main landing gear without success. The flight crew eventually landed the aircraft with the right main landing gear in the retracted position. The aircraft made a smooth touch down, slowing until the right engine nacelle contacted the runway. The aircraft remained under control during the landing with no injuries to the aircraft occupants. During the evacuation of the aircraft, fourteen passengers received minor injuries and three passengers were seriously injured while sliding down the L-1 slide. Findings 1. A foreign air carrier, the C-11 maintenance check provider, did not identify the number 1 or number 7 brake assemblies having eroded safety wire holes in the lock bolts installed on the brake rod retaining pin when performing a C-11 maintenance check. 2. All lock bolts installed on the brake rod retaining bolts should have been identified and evaluated for serviceability and replaced as necessary. 3. Orient Thai did not identify eroded safety wire holes in the lock bolts during the performance of maintenance activities including, brake replacement tasks, daily checks, and transit checks. 4. The accident was precipitated by the loss of two lock bolts that were not (or were not able to be) safety wired in place. Safety wiring the lock bolts would have prevented the right main landing gear brake rod retaining bolt from loosening and falling away from the pin.Sources: SABQ Online newspaper  AIB-2014-0001   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All four on board were killed. Before departure from Shoreham Airport, U.K, the pilot had called the destination airport, Trier-FÃ¶hren. He was told it would be better to postpone the departure because of thick fog. The departure was not postponed and the Citation jet took off from Shoreham about 10:00 hours. Alternate airfields were Luxembourg and Frankfurt-Hahn. Given the weather conditions the owner of the aircraft expected a diversion, and according to family members did not but pressure on the pilots to land at Trier. The en route and descent part of the flight were uneventful. At 11:45, while descending from FL90 to 5000 feet, the pilot in command contacted air traffic control to cancel their IFR clearance. The controller confirmed this and reported that they were 15 miles northwest of their destination airfield. The airplane was approaching runway 22 and descended until it was flying at a very low altitude, clearing trees by some 15-20 meters, according to eyewitnesses. It pulled up and struck an electricity pylon at a height of about 8 m above the ground. Control was lost and the airplane rolled inverted and crashed. It came to rest inverted on the site of a landfill, located 3,8 km from the threshold of runway 22 and about 700 m to the left of the extended centreline. A fire erupted. The continued descent to the ground likely occurred due to an erroneous selection of the target altitude with 0 ft (sea level) instead of the real aerodrome elevation (666 ft AMSL). Good Crew Resource Management could have brought this error to light but the different personality traits of the two pilots and particularly the captainÂs low appreciation of the co-pilot probably negatively influenced the working relationship in regards to CRM principles.  Weather at Trier about the time of the accident was a visibility of 100-150 m in fog, wind 040Â° at 3-5 knots, temperature -1Â°C, QNH 1020 hPa. Causes The accident was due to the following: - The Pilot in Command (PIC) decided to conduct the VFR approach even though he was aware of the prevailing instrument weather conditions at the airport - It is likely that a wrong vertical profile was flown due to an erroneous selection on the navigation system  - Due to an insufficient situational awareness of the pilots the descent was not aborted in time.

The airplane was destroyed. The pilot and cargo handler suffered fatal injuries. The aircraft took off from Olive Creek at 10:54, carrying fuel and other supplies for gold mining operations. Two and a half minutes after takeoff the engine lost power. The aircraft lost height and impacted an undulating and heavily forested area. Since only three of the seven oil drums were secured, the remaining four shifted forward during the crash. In June 2013 the aircraft received a Blackhawk modification, which consisted among others of the installation of a factory new P&W PT6A-42A engine. CONCLUSIONS: The investigation revealed that the probable cause of the accident was due to a power loss suffered by the engine. The power loss was associated with the fracture of one of the 1st stage compressor stator vanes by fatigue. The fatigue crack originated from a lack of brazing adhesion extending over approximately 0.280 inches along the chord length and 0.050 inches in the direction of the shroud thickness and was located between the leading edge and mid-chord of the vane.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: GCAA-AIT Report number: GCAA: 2/5/1/73 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources: Stabroek News 18-1-2014  CND 19-1-2014  Stabroek News 20-1-2014  AP, 19 Jan 2015   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane originated in Managua, Nicaragua and operated on a non-scheduled cargo flight to Saltillo via Tapachula, Mexico. The flight landed at Tapachula at 00:25 hours local time. An IFR flight plan was then filed for Saltillo, with Monterrey as alternate. It was not taken into account though, that Monterrey's main runway was closed that night as per Notam. The flight departed Tapachula at 01:40. The flight was uneventful up to the approach. The aircraft carried out an ILS/DME approach to runway 17. At 04:05 the flight was cleared to land by the controller. One minute later the pilot reported going around. He stated that they would divert to their alternate, Monterrey Airport. At 04:15 the pilot again contacted the controller at Saltillo, reporting that Monterrey Airport was closed and requesting another approach to runway 17. He radioed: ""We saw runway but ehhh let's do a rough minimum approach or below the minimums"". The airplane continued the approach until it touched down to the right of the centreline and on the last third of the runway. It rolled off the side and the nose gear collapsed. Probable Cause: ""Continuing the precision approach (ILS CAT 1) in conditions of reduced visibility by fog (no visual contact with the runway at an airport below minimums), which resulted in an abrupt landing and misaligned to the right on the last third of the runway, during a second landing attempt, the Commission also determined that what caused the continuation of the landing was the lack of fuel to fly to a second alternate airport not contemplated in the operation"". Contributing factors: 1. Lack of analysis of pre-flight operational information (current NOTAMs, METAR, forecasts, fuel to second alternate airport and flight tracking) 2. Unstabilized approach 3. Lack of application of CRM concepts 4. Lack of adherence to procedure - operations, of providing METAR and NOTAM to the crew for the dispatch of the aircraft. 5. Lack of adherence to the procedure for flight control and tracking 6. Lack of procedures to establish two alternate airports when the destination airport is below minimums. 7.

The accident flight was a commercial ferry flight from Roskilde to Merville, France. After takeoff from runway 11 at Roskilde, the aircraft was established in climb with a nose-up pitch attitude of approximately 13-15Â°. Just before reaching the flap retraction altitude of 400 feet above ground level, the flight crew noticed ""something white"" in front of the aircraft. The commander, who was the pilot flying, immediately initiated an aircraft pitch increase, but almost simultaneously a ""bang"" was heard and a bump was felt in the aircraft, most likely coming from the underside of the aircraft. The flight crew observed large white birds below the aircraft. The flight crew realized that the aircraft had been hit by one or more birds, probably Mute Swans, and decided to leave the flaps at the takeoff setting of 15Â°. Cockpit indications did not show any abnormalities and the aircraft handling and controllability did feel normal by the flight crew. In order to return to Roskilde, the flight crew performed a visual traffic pattern and approach to runway 11, followed by a normal landing and roll-out. The aircraft taxied to the run-up area for runway 29, where an inspection performed by the fire and rescue service personnel revealed that fuel leaked from the left wing. CONCLUSIONS: The accident was caused by a multiple birdstrike.  Up to four Mute Swans damaged the left wing leading edge and the nose radome which resulted in bending of the skin and the stringer structure beneath.  The left wing integral fuel tank structure was damaged resulting in a fuel leak.   Three contributing factors were identified:  1. The lighting condition in combination with the colour of the birds.  2. The small relative movement between the birds and the aircraft.  3. The aircraft nose-up pitch attitude might have impaired the flight crewÂs forward vision.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: HCLJ Report number: HCLJ510-2014-257 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) AIB Denmark; Roskilde Airport (RKE); January 2014 photo (c) AIB Denmark; Roskilde Airport (RKE); January 2014 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were no personal injuries on the 3 crew and 16 passengers on board. Flight F7-250 had departed Leipzig Airport (LEJ), Germany on a scheduled service to Paris-CDG. The copilot was the Pilot Flying (PF) while the captain was Pilot Monitoring (PM). The flight was cleared to perform an ILS approach to runway 27R. The aircraft intercepted the glide slope at 07:25.  The tower controller then cleared the flight to land and reported wind from 200Â° at 12 kt.  The captain again advises the OPL by reminding him when to set up the aircraft for landing. At an altitude of 2,300 ft the landing configuration was set (20Â° flap) and the approach target speed of 123 kt was selected.  At a height of 1000 ft, the approach was stable and the runway was in sight. At a height of about 400 ft, the PF disconnected the autopilot and at 200 ft, the decision height, the crew decided to continue the approach. Passing 50 ft, the PF gradually returned the power levers to the ""flight idle"" position and initiated the flare. Shortly before touchdown the captain pulled on the control column to the maximum nose-up value (11Â°) and the attitude reached a value of 5Â°. The wheels of the main landing gear hit the ground hard, and the airplane was at an indicated speed of about 120 kt. The airplane then bounced. The copilot then pushed the control column forward, causing a nose down attitude. De PM then again pulled on the controls and the aircraft bounced a second time. The PM increased power which was immediately reduced by the PF. The nose landing gear of the aircraft then impacted the runway and collapsed. Conclusion (translated from French): During the flare, the PIC said that the landing was going to be hard. In the emergency, he acted quickly  by pulling on the controls without announcing his intentions to Copilot. This lack of coordination within the crew led to a double piloting and successive and opposite actions on the flight controls during the management of the bounced landing.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Report number: hb-g140128 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: BEA History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  1 February 2001 HB-IZG Crossair 0 ZÃ¼rich-Kloten Airport (ZRH/LSZH) min Fumes/smoke/odor event Location  Images: photo (c) Markus Eigenheer; GenÃ¨ve-Cointrin Airport (GVA/LSGG); 08 November 2013; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Flight GL-3205 originated in Kangerlussuaq, Greenland. Three passengers were taken to the hospital for observation, there were no fatalities or serious injuries. On initial radio contact with Ilulissat AFIS, the flight crew got the information that runway 07 was in use. Weather information showed wind from 150Â° magnetic at 24 knots, maximum 33 knots, minimum 17 knots; a 24 knots cross wind, and a headwind of 5 knots. The wind at threshold runway 25 was gusting to 41 knots. Visibility was fine (10 km) with broken clouds at 12000 feet. The flight crew got visual contact with the Ilulissat area and due to the wind conditions and consequently expected turbulence on final, the flight crew prepared for a NDB/DME approach to runway 07 via JV NDB. Due to the cross wind conditions, the flight crew decided to do a landing with a flap setting of 15Â°.  The flight crew asked Ilulissat AFIS for a confirmation of whether or not the cross winds of 24 knots included the gusting wind conditions up to maximum 33 knots. Ilulissat AFIS replied that the maximum wind was 35 knots and the cross wind was 26 knots.  On a 5 miles final to runway 07, the wind conditions were reported to be 140Â° magnetic at 28 knots with a maximum of 35 knots and a cross wind of 26 knots. On short final to runway 07, the wind conditions were reported to 140Â° magnetic and 25 knots, maximum to 39 knots.  Upon touchdown on runway 07, the left main landing gear collapsed. With the left main landing collapsed and after approximately 104 meters of runway rolling, the flight crew started to loose aircraft directional control. After approximately 389 meters, the aircraft ran off the left side of the runway and into the safety zone. The aircraft skidded sideways, hit the Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) to runway 25, skidded down a steep slope and impacted a rocky area approximately 10 meters below the runway elevation.  The crew members initiated an evacuation of the aircraft. The flight crew found the flight deck door jammed and evacuated the flight deck through the flight compartment emergency exit hatch. The cabin crew member and a passenger had difficulties opening a partly jammed main entrance door. In cooperation with the commander from the outside of the aircraft, they succeeded. From the outside of the aircraft, the commander opened the forward right hand cabin emergency exit door. The passengers and the cabin crew member evacuated the passenger cabin trough the main entrance door. The overall evacuation took approximately 30-40 seconds. Ilulissat Airport has a single, 07/25 asphalt runway, 845 m (2772 ft) long. Runway 07 has a 0,8% downslope for the first 550 m, followed by a 0,2% upslope for 295 m. Conclusion: Adverse crosswind conditions at BGJN led to flight crew target fixation, a flight crew divergence from the operator's stabilized approach parameters and a mental blocking of an appropriate decision on going around.  The flight crew divergence from the operator's stabilized approach parameters induced a non-stabilized approach, which in combination with power levers retarded below flight idle in flight resulted in an accelerated rate of descent leading to a hard landing, with side load on the left main landing gear at touchdown.  The left main landing gear structural fuse pin sheared as a result of lateral and vertical overload stress. Cycling the power levers between ground and flight range prevented an appropriate deceleration of the aircraft and prolonged the landing roll.  The prolonged landing roll combined with the application of full left rudder and no decisive use of reverse thrust on the side with the unaffected main landing gear made it impossible for the flight crew to maintain directional control.  The lack of directional control resulted in the aircraft running off the side of the runway and the safety zone, respectively.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: HCLJ Report number: HCLJ510-2014-258 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Air Greenland   Location  Images: photo (c) AIB Denmark; Ilulissat Airport (JAV); 29 January 2014 photo (c) AIB Denmark; Ilulissat Airport (JAV); 29 January 2014 photo (c) Martin KleinwÃ¤chter; Kulusuk Airport (KUS/BGKK); 08 August 2012 photo (c) Timo Blossfeld; Seattle/Tacoma International Airport, WA (SEA/KSEA); 08 June 2007 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates26-Apr-2024 17:20 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The copilot was at the controls of the airplane while the pilot monitored the airplaneâs systems and prepared for takeoff. During the engine start, one of the two linemen providing ground services to the airplane departed the ramp area leaving one lineman alone, which the operator allowed for normal ground servicing operations. After completing the engine start, the copilot gave the disconnect ground power hand signal to the lineman. The lineman responded with the hold hand signal and then moved to the left and rear of the airplane to disconnect the ground power unit (GPU). The pilot stated that he monitored the airplane's voltmeter to verify that the GPU was disconnected by observing a drop in the voltage current. However, although the drop in voltage could confirm that the GPU was no longer supplying power, it could not confirm that the GPU cable was disconnected. The pilot then looked out the window and realized that the airplane was moving forward. The pilot took the controls, applied the brakes, and set the parking brake. The pilot did not have visual contact with the lineman, so he asked the two crewmembers seated in the cabin to locate him, and one of the crewmembers reported that she saw him standing next to the GPU. The pilot then began to taxi the airplane for departure within the nonmovement area of the ramp; the pilot did not realize that the GPU was still connected to the airplane. As the airplane turned right, the GPU was pulled onto its side, and it then fell onto the linemanâs right leg, which resulted in a serious injury. The pilot stopped the airplane and shut down the engines without further incident. The pilot should have ensured that the GPU was disconnected from the airplane via hand signals from the lineman providing ground services before taxiing the airplane and his failure to do so resulted in the linemanâs injury. Probable Cause: The pilotâs failure to ensure that the ground power unit was disconnected from the airplane via hand signals from the lineman providing ground services before taxiing, which resulted in an injury to the lineman.

The aircraft operated as East Air flight ETJ704 from Moscow's Domodedovo Airport to Kulob. Weather at Kulob was poor due to heavy snowfall. The airport's single runway, 01/19 (3000 m long, 45 m wide), was cleared of snow on the north side. The south side, from the threshold to the middle of the runway, was partly cleared with path of 21 m wide. On both sides of the path a 50-95 cm high snow berm was present. During final approach to runway 01 the pilot in command disconnected the autopilot and switched to manual control of the airplane. The plane landed on runway 01 at a distance of 230 m from the runway threshold, at a speed of 255 km/h. The wheels of the right hand main gear crossed the border the runway at a distance of about 520 m from the threshold and the aircraft continued along the side of the runway. The wheels left main landing gear remained on the runway. At a distance of 710 m from the threshold both engines quit due to ingress of large amounts of snow. The nose landing gear collapsed and the airplane slid until it stopped 1190 m from the beginning of the runway. There was no fire and none of the occupants were injured. CONCLUSION (translation from Russian): The cause of the accident with the aircraft A320-231 EY-623 was the aircraft collision with a snow berm while landing on an unprepared runway, which was cleared by a width of about 22m (runway width being 45m), and where there were snow berms at a height of 50-95cm along the borders. The aircraft's right main gear contacted a snow berm, which led to the destruction of the nose landing gear and self-termination of engines and the aircraft moving off the runway to the right. The accident was the result of a combination of the following factors: - decision by the flight director to receive an aircraft on an unprepared runway; - the unreadiness of the runway at the time of arrival of the aircraft and the failure to make a corresponding entry in the ""Journal of the state of the airfield"" with the runway measures.METAR: 02:00 UTC / 07:00 local time: UTDK 020200Z 26003MPS 0800 SN FZFG VV003 M09/M10 Q1031 0129//60 RMK QBB100 QFE715/0953Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: A320 EY-623 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) Interstate Aviation Committee; Kulob Airport (TJU); 02 February 2014 photo (c) Interstate Aviation Committee; Kulob Airport (TJU); 02 February 2014 photo (c) Interstate Aviation Committee; Kulob Airport (TJU); 02 February 2014 photo (c) Interstate Aviation Committee; Kulob Airport (TJU); 02 February 2014 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Night instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) prevailed at the time of the accident.  The airplane was on an instrument approach to runway 17 at Elk City Airport about 23:00 local time (05:00 UTC) when it impacted a 29-foot tall electric utility pole about 10 feet 7 inches above ground level, located two miles north of the runway. The impact scattered debris from the separated pole for about 200 feet and resulted in substantial damage to the fuselage and horizontal stabilizer. The pilot executed a go-around and diverted to Oklahoma City-Will Rogers Airport, OK (OKC), where it landed without incident about 23:40 local time (05:40 UTC). The pilot reported that he thought he had leveled the airplane at an indicated altitude 2,500 feet msl and at no time during the descent and approach did the airplane's radar altimeter sound an alert indicating that he was below 400 feet agl radar altitude. He also reported that he never saw the terrain, never saw any obstructions, and he never saw the runway lights or airport environment.  An examination of the airplane after landing at OKC showed substantial damage to the nose structure, lower and upper fuselage, and the left side of the horizontal stabilizer. The right side of the radome had impact damage and there was a penetrating impact in the right side of the forward avionics bay. There was also evidence that both engines had ingested foreign objects, but there was not a resulting significant loss of engine power.

The captain indicated that, while the airplane was level at about 2,000 ft on the base leg, the flight entered clouds. The first officer stated that she noted moisture on the windshield wiper and the captain indicated that the wind screen was wet. The cockpit voice recorder (CVR) recorded the captain and first officer briefly discussing ice; however, the airplane's ice protection system, which was set to the automatic mode, did not operate automatically, and the crew did not activate the system manually. The crew did not see the ice light come on and there were no icing messages on the engine indicating and crew alerting system. As the first officer was applying control inputs to adjust for a crosswind, a rapid roll to the right occurred, which resulted in a wing strike and substantial damage to the airplane.  About forty minutes after arrival at the gate, an examination of the airplane found an accretion of ice on the leading edge of both wings. The aircraft performance study, which correlated icing charts with the airplane's flight profile, determined that the airplane spent over 20 minutes at altitudes where icing was probable during both approaches. The study concluded that the right roll was not commanded by the flight crew but likely due to ice buildup.  Although the vertical load factor did not indicate that the airplane experienced a full aerodynamic stall, the ice buildup likely created enough flow separation on one wing for it to lose lift during the flare, without affecting the control of the aircraft in a measurable way during the approach.  After the accident, the ice detection and anti-ice systems were tested at the aircraft level with no anomalies identified. The ice detectors were also functionally tested by the manufacturer at the component level with no anomalies identified that could have contributed to the event. A review of FDR data revealed that no failures were recorded for the ice detection system during the accident flight. Additionally, the system operated as expected during a manual preflight test and detected icing conditions during the previous flight. A review of the maintenance records did not reveal any systematic problems with the ice detection system.  Therefore, it could not be determined why the ice detection system did not detect the presence of icing conditions even though the airplane accreted ice during the approach. This possibly could have been due to variations in static air temperature that prevented the ice that accumulated on the sensors from reaching the alert threshold or the occurrence of meteorological conditions out of the 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 25 Appendix C during approach, or a combination of these two factors.Ã¢â¬Â Although the ice detection system did not automatically activate the ice protection system, the CVR recorded a brief discussion during the final approach indicating that the crew was aware that the airplane was picking up 'a little bitÃ¢â¬Â of ice.  According to the Trans States Airlines EMB145 Airplane Operations Manual (AOM) and Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), even though the airplane is equipped with an ice detector, the crew was responsible for monitoring icing conditions and for manual activation of the ice protection system when necessary.  Therefore, the crew recognized that the airplane was operating in icing conditions and accumulating ice and should have manually activated the ice protection system. It is likely the crew's overreliance on automation for the activation and proper operation of the ice and rain protection system resulted in their failure to adequately monitor the system and respond appropriately when it did not activate automatically. Although the AOM and SOPs indicated that the crew is responsible for monitoring icing conditions and for manual activation of the ice protection system when necessary, there was no information in Trans States Airlines ground training modules that presented the crew as being responsible for monitoring and activating the ice and rain protection system when no warnings or cautions were received from the EICAS. Additionally, manual ice detection methods for flight crews to use when flying in potential icing conditions were not specifically referenced during ground training. The Trans States Airlines manager of flight standards said that manual selection of the anti-ice system was not emphasized in training like the automatic mode of operation was during flight operations. It is possible that because the manual operation of the airplane's ice protection system was not emphasized during training, the crew may not have recognized the need to perform this task.  Trans States Airlines issued an operations bulletin after the accident that stated interim procedures for crewmembers to follow when operating in potential in-flight icing conditions. The bulletin called for active monitoring of the deicing/anti-icing equipment and, if it did not activate, to accomplish the QRH's Ice Detectors Fail procedures.   Probable Cause: the failure of the flight crew to adequately monitor the system for proper operation and manually activate the system during the flight in icing conditions. Contributing to the accident was the crew's limited training on the manual operation of the anti-ice system and the nonactivation of the automatic ice detection system for reasons that could not be determined.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA14FA058 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 7 years Download report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA14FA058  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates06-Oct-2022 18:08 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...

The damage were found after the training flight was completed.  The crew were uninjured.  Japan Transport Safety Board says the trainee probably changed from a crab approach to a wing-low attitude to counter the crosswind, and that the aircraft initially contacted the runway with its right-hand main gear. The Dash 8 bounced and pitched up slightly, says the inquiry, and the trainee pushed on the control column â a decision which âabruptlyâ caused the aircraft to pitch to 4.57Â° nose-down. JTSB says the trainee had thought the nose of the turboprop was âtaking longerâ to lower than it should have. He had also been influenced by the captainâs observations that he tended to pitch the nose too high while switching from crabbing to a wing-low attitude, and that he also needed to push harder on the control column to maintain direction during take-off. JTSB says the recorded impact was 2.016g, and this caused the shock strut brace of the nose-gear to contact the runway surface. It is probable that the accident occurred while the aircraft was landing under strong crosswind, under the condition that the main landing gear grounded without sufficient load being applied, the nose of the airplane downed excessively and the nose landing gear grounded heavily, which caused damage on the nose landing gear and the deformation of the right and left fuselage skins. As for the nose landing gear of the aircraft grounding heavily, it is probable that the trainee continuously downed the nose, and subsequently the captain who was the instructor failed to provided an appropriate corrective operation.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JTSB Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: http://jtsb.mlit.go.jp/jtsb/aircraft/detail.php?id=2082  [LINK NOT WORKING ANYMORE:http://www.nhk.or.jp/lnews/nagasaki/5035213083.html?t=1392294916081]  http://www.orc-air.co.jp/db_img/news_img/272/c20140213123519343.pdf  http://www.mlit.go.jp/jtsb/eng-air_report/JA801B.pdf History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  8 March 2017 JA801B Oriental Air Bridge 0 over Sasebo city, Nagasaki prefecture unk 27 September 2017 JA801B Oriental Air Bridge 0 Nagasaki prefecture unk Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates13-Feb-2014 13:10 isamuel Added 25-May-2016 14:01 Aerossurance Updated [Time, Source, Narrative, ]03-Jul-2023 09:27 harro Updated Corrections or additions? ...

All 18 on board sustained fatal injuries. Flight RA183 was a domestic flight from Kathmandu to Jumla with a refueling stop at Pokhara. The airplane took off from Pokhara at 12:43. Upon leaving Pokhara Control Zone, the pilot in command realized that the direct track was not possible due weather and decided to proceed via a more southern track. During the flight the pilots were experiencing uncomfortable flying environment due to unfavorable weather conditions. Attempting to avoid the weather, the pilots had to fly up and down and changing the heading. Finally being unable to penetrate the weather ahead, the captain decided to divert to Bhairahawa, the nearest airport. However, the captain did not take into consideration the surrounding terrain and continued descent turning right.  The aircraft initially slashed a small tree and finally impacted a ridge. Due to the heavy impact the left wing was first disintegrated and then the front part of the aircraft toppled over beyond the ridge with several subsequent impacts. The cockpit voice recorder showed that the copilot had warned the captain not to descend or turn. The wreckage was located the following morning at an altitude of 7190 feet (2192 m). There were no surivors. Causes: After detail investigation and thorough analysis of the circumstances and evidences, the Commission has determined that the most probable causes of the accident is the  ""Losing situational awareness on the part of PIC while flying into instrument meteorological weather condition to the extent of Collision with terrain."" The contributing factors to the occurrence are; - Deteriorated weather associated with western disturbance, unstable in nature and embedded CB. - Inappropriate and insufficient crew coordination while changing course of action.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Nepal AAIC Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: ekantipur.com  Nepali Times  Hemant Arjyal  SKYbraryÂ  History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  5 July 1992 9N-ABB Royal Nepal Airlines 0 Jumla Airport (JUM) sub Location  Images: photo (c) Krish Dulal; near Sandhikhark; 17 February 2014; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Kathmandu-Tribhuvan Airport (KTM/VNKT); 27 October 2011 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

During the collision sequence, a gap opened rapidly between the Passenger Loading Bridge (PLB) and the aircraft door (L1). A female cabin crewmember was standing in the vicinity of door L1. As result of the sudden movement of the aircraft the crewmember fell through the gap from a height of approximately 3 meters onto the tarmac.  The crewmember sustained serious injury and was transported to the hospital.  Causes The Air Accident Investigation Sector determines that the causes of the Accident were: 3.3.1 The catering vehicle driver was not aware that the vehicle was approaching the Aircraft at excessive speed; and 3.3.2 The performance of the driver was degraded, most probably, due to tiredness or distraction.

Of the 120 passengers and crew onboard, two flight attendants were seriously injured, and one FA and nine passengers received minor injuries. The airplane was not damaged. The flight was operating under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 as a regularly scheduled passenger flight from Denver International Airport (DEN), Denver, Colorado, to Billings Logan International Airport (BIL), Billings, Montana. The flight departed DEN normally and climbed to a cruising altitude of flight level (FL) 380. The flight encountered light turbulence and the crew requested, and was granted, a descent to FL360 followed by a descent to FL340. The flight crew extinguished the seat belt sign when the ride smoothed out. Flight data recorder (FDR) data indicated the airplane was cruising about FL340 when it encountered an area of severe turbulence for about 55 seconds. The most severe turbulence occurred for about 10 seconds when the vertical acceleration fluctuated between about -1.23 g's and +2.05 g's, the lateral acceleration fluctuated between about -0.27 g's and +0.23 g's, the pitch fluctuated between about +5.8Â° (nose up) and -1.8Â° (nose down), and the roll fluctuated between about 14Â° left and 20Â° right. At the time of the turbulence encounter, the two flight attendants (FA) in the forward galley and the one FA in the aft galley were injured. during the turbulence encounter and suffered. The aft FA was unconscious after the event and tended to by medical personnel passengers until landing. After being notified of the serious injuries, the flight crew declared an emergency with air traffic control and arranged for medical personnel to meet the aircraft at BIL. The three FAs were transported to the hospital. One FA was diagnosed with a fractured fibula; one was diagnosed with fractures of her scapula, a rib, cervical vertebrae, and thoracic vertebrae; and one was treated and released with minor injuries. According to the NTSB weather study, an Airman's Meteorological Information (AIRMET) for moderate turbulence for altitudes between FL270 and FL390 was issued at 0745 MST for a region that included the accident location. The flight dispatch release for the accident aircraft, which included weather information, included a Flight Planning Guidance product from WSI that advised of light/occasional moderate mountain wave activity between FL310 and FL390 close to where the accident occurred. Probable Cause: an encounter with severe mountain wave turbulence during cruise flight.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA14LA060 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  https://flightaware.com/live/flight/UAL1676/history/20140217/1815Z/KDEN/KBIL  NTSB File DCA14LA060 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  14 March 2016 N23708 United Airlines 0 Port Arthur, Texas non Turbulence Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates19-Feb-2014 10:10 whiteshark Added 19-Feb-2014 10:11 harro Updated [Location, Narrative, ]19-Feb-2014 17:19 Geno Updated [Time, Other fatalities, Location, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, ]19-Feb-2014 17:22 Geno Updated [Source, ]20-Feb-2014 06:20 Whiteshark Updated [Time, Narrative, ]03-Mar-2014 16:31 Geno Updated [Time, Phase, Source, Narrative, ]21-Dec-2016 19:28 ASN Update Bot Updated [Time, Damage, Category, Investigating agency, ]03-May-2020 18:58 ASN Update Bot Updated [Time, Operator, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, Accident report, ]05-May-2021 07:25 goldfish85 Updated [Location, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, ]09-May-2021 14:26 harro Updated [Total occupants, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The captain was Pilot Flying (PF). The en route part and descent towards Funchal (FNC), Madeira, were uneventful. There was a partially cloudy sky at Funchal with good visibility, surface wind was strong from 330Â° at 14 kts gusting to 24 kts, with variations in direction between 220Â° and 020Â°. Temperature was 15Â°C.  The commander reported that the visual approach to runway 05 seemed normal until the point Rosario, when he began to notice effects of ""wind shear"" and coincident with the automatic altitude call of 50 feet, the aircraft developed a high sink rate. The PF continued with the approach and he attempted to arrest the rate of descent but the aircraft landed heavily and bounced to a height of about 8 feet and continued for about 300 meters. During the second contact with the runway, the tail of the aircraft struck its surface at a speed of about 140 kts. The PF was able to control the aircraft safely within the confines of the runway. A preliminary visual inspection showed some deformation of the outer surface of the fuselage and significant skid marks on the underside of the rear fuselage. Closer inspection, performed by maintenance services, revealed the existence of a deformed drain tube, some bent struts with five cracks found on two fuselage frames that had suffered structural damage from the vertical loads sustained in the contact with the runway. CAUSE:  The accident was due to an excessive nose up input after the first contact with the runway and at a time in which the aircraft was airborne at around 8 feet (RA) which, associated to the manual deployment of the speedbrakes and consequent loss of lift, resulted in a sharp nose up attitude (9.15Â°) to a point of causing the tail strike with the runway surface. Contributing factors: 1. The Normal Checklist (Landing) was not executed (737-800 FCOM Chapter NP); 2. The aircraft approach was conducted under turbulence conditions in the last 150 feet; 3. Aircraft deviation from the ""stabilized approach"" profile which implied the execution of a go-around (737 NG FCTM Chapter 5); 4.

A steeper-than-usual climb was carried out to reduce exposure to turbulence. However, other than the expected turbulence during the first 1,500 ft, there was nothing significant during the climb to FL170. During cruise, the crew conducted a routine brief for the anticipated arrival to runway 16R, which was expected to be standard except for commencement of descent 5 NM (9 km) earlier than normal to compensate for a tailwind. The captain noted the need to be cognizant of managing airspeed during the descent as the anticipated decreasing tailwind would result in a temporary increase in the indicated airspeed. The first officer commenced descent into Sydney with the autopilot engaged in vertical speed mode and a target airspeed of 235 kt (15 kt less than the maximum operating speed of 250 kt). The descent was reported to have been initially stable and smooth. On first contact with Sydney Approach the crew were assigned runway 16L. This was different to the expected runway and required the crew to re-brief the approach and change the instrument approach diagrams and navigational aid frequencies. Passing 8,500 ft above mean sea level (AMSL), the crew noticed a rapid airspeed increase. The first officer reported that the airspeed trend indicator was 'off the chart', indicating a very rapid increase in airspeed. The first officer reduced engine power and used touch control steering to temporarily disconnect the autopilot before manually raising the aircraft's nose to control the speed. The first officer expected that, in combination, the pitch correction and power reduction would be sufficient to arrest the speed trend. The first officer reported that the aircraft felt 'heavy', as was normal for this aircraft at that speed, requiring two hands on the controls to move from the then -4Â° pitch angle.  The captain reported being unsure if the first officer's control inputs would be sufficient to avoid exceeding the maximum operating speed limitation, so put one of his hands on the controls and disconnected the autopilot to raise the nose further. Shortly after, with both flight crew making simultaneous nose up pitch inputs on the controls, the aircraft rapidly pitched up with an associated increase in the g load. The first officer responded by immediately reversing the control input to nose down. Both flight crew noticed that the controls suddenly felt different and 'spongy'. At about the same time, aural and visual cockpit warnings activated. The crew verified that the aircraft was under control at a stable attitude and speed, observing that it was level or in a slight descent at an airspeed of about 230 kt. One of the cockpit warnings was 'pitch disconnect', indicating that the left and right elevator control systems had uncoupled from each other. This allowed for independent movement of the left and right elevators via the captain's and first officer's control columns respectively. The crew consulted the pitch disconnect checklist and worked to identify which control column was free and working normally. After determining that both controls were free, it was decided that the captain would be pilot flying for the remainder of the approach and landing at Sydney Airport. The aerodynamic loads generated during the pitch disconnect resulted in serious injury to the senior cabin crew member and significant damage to the aircraft's horizontal stabiliser.  = Inspection = Two maintenance engineers were tasked to inspect the aircraft after landing. A readout of the aircraft systems computer revealed a maximum vertical load factor of 3.34 g at 16:41 hours. This load factor was abnormally high and prompted one of the engineers to discuss it with the crew, who were surprised about the high value. The crew added Âassociated with moderate turbulenceÂ to the maintenance log entry. Since this g-value was outside of the acceptable limits for the aircraft weight, the engineer he grounded the aircraft.   The applicable maintenance was determined to be the 'Inspection after flight in turbulence and/or exceeding VMO'. That evening a visual inspection was conducted of the wing, using an elevated platform. The engineer also used a torch to inspect the rear fuselage and tail. However, no high-access platform was available, so no close visual inspection was performed on the horizontal stabilizer.  Other maintenance was carried out the next morning, which consisted of among others an operational test of the pitch uncoupling mechanism re-engagement system. The aircraft was then released for service on 13:30 the day after the accident. Subsequent to the post-occurrence maintenance completed on 21 February 2014, the aircraft was operated on a further 13 flights. The respective flight crews did not record any anomalies or defects during their pre-flight inspections and there were no reports of any abnormal aircraft handling characteristics. = Feb 25 incident = On 25 February, aircraft VH-FVR was operated on a scheduled passenger flight from Sydney to Albury, NSW. On descent into Albury, the aircraft passed in close proximity to birds, which alerted the captain to the possibility of a birdstrike on the left side of the aircraft. There were no in-flight indications that a bird had struck the aircraft but after landing, the captain noticed the aircraftÂs pitch trim system fluctuated abnormally. The captain conducted a walk-around inspection and, although there was no evidence of a birdstrike on the left of the aircraft, he identified a dent in the top leading edge of the vertical stabiliser. The captain advised the operatorÂs maintenance watch who dispatched an engineer to Albury to inspect the aircraft. The engineer used scissor lift equipment to gain access to, and inspect the stabiliser. He did not find any evidence of a birdstrike, such as blood or feathers. However, the engineer did find indications of significant structural damage to the horizontal stabiliser, and contacted maintenance watch to cancel the following flights. Upon further examination and discussion with the airline, it became evident that the damage found at Albury was probably a consequence of the occurrence on 20 February. Findings: From the evidence available, the following findings are made regarding the in-flight upset and inadvertent pitch disconnect involving ATR 72 aircraft, VH-FVR on 20 February 2014 resulting in cabin crew injury and serious aircraft damage. A post-event maintenance inspection was carried out but the aircraft damage was not detected. Consequently, the aircraft was operated for another 13 flights over 5 days before the damage was identified. Contributing factors: - During the descent, when the sterile flight deck policy was applicable, the flight crew engaged in non-pertinent conversation. This distracted the crew and probably reduced their ability to monitor and respond to fluctuations of airspeed. - While passing through about 8,500 ft on descent into Sydney, the aircraft encountered a significant windshear that resulted in a rapidly decreasing tailwind. This led to a rapid increase in the airspeed, with the airspeed trend vector likely indicating well above the maximum operating speed (VMO). - Although the first officer (pilot flying) was in the process of attempting to control the airspeed, in response to the unexpectedly high airspeed trend indication, and their proximity to VMO, the captain (pilot not flying) perceived a need to immediately intervene, and made pitch control inputs before following the normal take-over procedure and alerting the first officer. - The addition of the captainÂs and first officerÂs nose-up control inputs resulted in a pitching manoeuvre that exceeded the limit load factor for the aircraft of 2.5 g. - The magnitude of the captain's nose-up control input was probably greater than he intended, due to his response to a high stress level, but increased the probability that the aircraft's limit load factor would be exceeded. - Shortly after the captain initiated the nose-up control inputs, the first officer reversed his control input. The differential forces in the left (captain) and right (first officer) pitch control systems were sufficiently large to inadvertently activate the pitch uncoupling mechanism, disconnecting the left and right pitch control systems. - Given the high airspeed, the asymmetric elevator deflections that occurred immediately following the pitch disconnect event resulted in aerodynamic loads on the tailplane that exceeded its strength and damaged the horizontal stabiliser. - The design of the ATR 72 pitch control system resulted in limited tactile feedback between the left and right control columns, reducing the ability of one pilot to detect that the other pilot is making control inputs. In addition, there were no visual or auditory systems to indicate dual control inputs.

The captain was Pilot Flying.  The en route part of the first leg was uneventful. Runway in use at Terceira-Lajes Airport was runway 15. There was a partially cloudy sky, good visibility, a strong surface wind from southwest (190Â° at 22 kts gusting to 32 kts), with direction variations between 160Â° and 230Â° and the air temperature was 15Â°C.  The commander reported that the visual approach to runway 15 seemed normal until 5 NM from touchdown. Winds were registered at a speed of up to 50 kts and there was severe turbulence along the entire approach.  Below 1000 feet the crew noticed effects of down-drafts and up-drafts, with huge variations in intensity until short final. The captain stated that he opted to maintain an angle of descent (G/S) above the recommended, due to severe turbulence and to ensure a safety margin. The entire approach was flown with Auto Thrust connected, for effective and accurate speed control.  The aircraft developed a high sink rate and lost speed instantly. This was counteracted by the captain with increasing power and attitude, in an attempt to stabilize the sink-rate. Touchdown occurred with a high rate of descent and a short flare, resulting in an impact on the main landing gear of 3.52 G vertical acceleration, followed by a bounce. A forward push of the control column by the pilot flying resulted in a pitch-down attitude of -1.9Â° with a second impact of 2.75 G vertical acceleration over the nose wheel causing substantial damage in that area of the aircraft fuselage. An inspection revealed the existence of some folded braces in the interior structure of the nose wheel bay with some bent struts, cracks found in fuselage frames that had suffered structural damage from the vertical loads applied in the contact with the runway. CAUSES:  1. Procedural The flight crew did not comply with aircraft manufacturer procedures and company SOPs, which required a ""go around"" manoeuvre; 2. Actuation The accident was due to an excessive control column forward input, causing aircraft negative pitch attitude which led to a very high impact loading on the nose undercarriage, leading to the severe damage of braces in the interior structure of the nose wheel bay, struts and fuselage frames. This followed a chain of events, which contributed to the accident including the wind gusts, turbulence, decision to fly above ILS G/P, the use of the A/T without A/P and the decision to land from an unstabilized final approach. The following were considered as contributing factors: 1. The aircraft approach was conducted under turbulent conditions; 2. The PF established an approach profile of one dot of scale above the nominal ILS G/S; 3. The PF did not disconnect the A/T after disengagement of the A/P; 4. Deviation from aircraft ""stabilized approach"" profile; 5. The PM did not provide the required call outs for the ""stabilized approach"" deviations.METAR: 07:00 UTC / 06:00 local time: LPLA 220700Z 19022G32KT 160V230 9999 FEW008 BKN012 14/13 Q1013=08:00 UTC / 07:00 local time: LPLA 220800Z 20018G28KT 9999 VCSH FEW008 BKN011 15/14 Q1011=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: GPIAA Report number: 04/ACCID/2014 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were 227 passengers and 12 crew members on board. The Boeing 777-2H6ER took off from Kuala Lumpur International Airport's runway 32R at 00:41. At 00:42 the flight was cleared to climb to FL180 and was issued a direct track by Lumpur Approach to the IGARI waypoint. MH370 was then transferred to Lumpur Radar and was cleared to climb to FL250. At 00:50 the flight was further cleared to the planned cruising altitude of FL350. MH370 reported maintaining FL350 at 01:07. Last radio contact was at 01:19 when the Kuala Lumpur Radar controller instructed the flight to contact the radio frequency of Ho Chi Minh Air Traffic Control Centre, Vietnam: ""Malaysian Three Seven Zero contact Ho Chi Minh 120 decimal 9 Good Night"". One of the flight crew members replied: ""Good night, Malaysian Three Seven Zero.""  At 01:21 MH370 was observed on the radar screen of the Kuala Lumpur Radar controller as it passed over waypoint IGARI. Nine seconds later the radar label for MH370 disappeared from the radar screen. The transponder was switched off.  At 01:38 Ho Chi Minh ATCC contacted Kuala Lumpur ATCC on the whereabouts of MH370. Kuala Lumpur ATCC contacted the airline's operations centre, Singapore ACC, Hong Kong ACC, and Phnom Penh ACC, failing to establish the location of MH370. Meanwhile, the airplane flew in a westerly direction back over peninsular Malaysia before turning northwest. Primary radar data showed that the aircraft tracked along the Malacca Strait. During this time the aircraft passed close to waypoints VAMPI, MEKAR, NILAM and possibly IGOGU along a section of airway N571. The final primary radar fix occurred at 02:22. From then on seven handshakes between the aircraft's SATCOM system and the Inmarsat ground station were recorded. Last satellite data was recorded at 08:11 Malaysian time. Initially search efforts focused on the South China Sea area. On 24 March 2014 further analysis of the Inmarsat satellite data indicated that MH370 flew south and ended its flight in the southern part of the Indian Ocean.  A surface search was conducted of probable impact areas along an arc, identified by calculations based on Inmarsat data. The search was carried out from 18 March - 28 April 2014. This search effort was undertaken by an international fleet of aircraft and ships with the search areas over this time progressing generally from an initial southwest location along the arc in a north-easterly direction. No debris associated with MH370 was identified either from the surface search, acoustic search or from the ocean floor search in the vicinity of acoustic detections, which were initially believed to have been from the pingers on the flight recorders. The ocean floor search was completed on 28 May 2014. On June 26 the ATSB published a new search area based on refinements to the analysis of both the flight and satellite data. The priority area of approximately 60,000 km2 extends along the arc for 650 km in a northeast direction from Broken Ridge, an underwater ridge. The width of the priority search area is 93 km. On July 29, 2015 a flapperon washed ashore on the French island of RÃ©union in the Indian Ocean. On August 5 it was established to have been from MH370. The Team is unable to determine the real cause for the disappearance of MH370.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MH370 Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 years and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: mh370search.com  DCA Malaysia  ATC Transcript  Malaysia Airlines History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  9 August 2012 9M-MRO Malaysia Airlines 0 Shanghai-Pudong International Airport (PVG/ZSPD) sub Location  Images: photo (c) ATSB; 20 July 2016 photo (c) ATSB photo (c) ATSB photo (c) ATSB photo (c) ATSB photo (c) ATSB photo (c) Mark Ijsseldijk; Tokyo-Narita Airport (NRT/RJAA); 25 August 2010 photo (c) Stanley Page; Frankfurt International Airport (FRA/EDDF); 28 September 2013 photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Newark-Liberty International Airport, NJ (EWR/KEWR); January 2004 photo (c) Stemoc; Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG/LFPG); 26 December 2011 photo (c) Ahmet Akin Diler; Istanbul-AtatÃ¼rk International Airport (IST/LTBA); 02 December 2009 photo (c) Joao Ponces; Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KUL/WMKK); 04 April 2013 photo (c) Paul Rowbotham; Los Angeles International Airport, CA (LAX/KLAX); October 2013 photo (c) Willem GÃ¶ebel; Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS/EHAM); 03 February 2013 photo (c) Wolfgang Bergemann; Tokyo-Narita Airport (NRT/RJAA); 11 December 2006 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates04-Jan-2025 11:16 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Before pushback from the gate, the first officer, who was the pilot monitoring, initialized the flight management computer (FMC) and mistakenly entered the incorrect departure runway (27R instead of the assigned 27L). As the captain taxied onto runway 27L for departure, he noticed that the wrong runway was entered in the FMC. The captain asked the first officer to correct the runway entry in the FMC, which she completed about 27 seconds before the beginning of the takeoff roll; however, she did not enter the FLEX temperature (a reduced takeoff thrust setting) for the newly entered runway or upload the related V-speeds. As a result, the FMC's ability to execute a FLEX power takeoff was invalidated, and V-speeds did not appear on the primary flight display (PFD) or the multipurpose control display unit during the takeoff roll.  Once the airplane was cleared for takeoff on runway 27L, the captain set FLEX thrust with the thrust levers, and he felt that the performance and acceleration of the airplane on the takeoff roll was normal. About 2 seconds later, as the airplane reached about 56 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS), the flight crew received a single level two caution chime and an electronic centralized aircraft monitoring (ECAM) message indicating that the thrust was not set correctly. The first officer called ""engine thrust levers not set."" According to the operator's pilot handbook, in response to an ""engine thrust levers not set"" ECAM message, the thrust levers should be moved to the takeoff/go-around (TO/GA) detent. However, the captain responded by saying ""they're set"" and moving the thrust levers from the FLEX position to the CL (climb) detent then back to the FLEX position. As the airplane continued to accelerate, the first officer did not make a callout at 80 KIAS, as required. As the airplane reached 86 KIAS, the automated RETARD aural alert sounded and continued until the end of the CVR recording. According to Airbus, the RETARD alert is designed to occur at 20 ft radio altitude on landing and advise the pilot to reduce the thrust levers to idle. The captain later reported that he had never heard an aural RETARD alert on takeoff, only knew of it on landing, and did not know what it was telling him. He further said that when the RETARD aural alert sounded, he did not plan to reject the takeoff because they were in a high-speed regime, they had no red warning lights, and there was nothing to suggest that the takeoff should be rejected.  The first officer later reported that there were no V-speeds depicted on the PFD and, thus, she could not call V1 or VR during the takeoff. She was not aware of any guidance or procedure that recommended rejecting or continuing a takeoff when there were no V-speeds displayed. The captain stated that he had recalled the V-speeds as previously briefed from the Taxi checklist, which happened to be the same V-speeds for runway 27L. The captain continued the takeoff roll despite the lack of displayed V-speeds, no callouts from the first officer, and the continued and repeated RETARD aural alert.  The airplane rotated at 164 KIAS. The captain had ""the perception the aircraft was unsafe to fly"" and that he decided ""the safest action was not to continue,"" so he commenced a rejected takeoff. FDR data indicate that the captain reduced the engines to idle and made an airplane-nose-down input as the airplane reached 167 KIAS (well above the V1 speed of 157 KIAS) and achieved a 6.7 degree nose-high attitude. The airplane's pitch decreased until the nosegear contacted the runway. However, the airplane then bounced back into the air and achieved a radio altitude of about 15 ft. The tail of the airplane then struck the runway surface, followed by the main landing gear then the nose landing gear, resulting in its fracture. The airplane slid to its final resting position on the left side of runway 27L. The operator's SOPs address the conditions under which a rejected takeoff should be performed within both low-speed (below 80 KIAS) and high-speed (between 80 KIAS and V1) regimes but provide no guidance for rejecting a takeoff after V1 and rotation. Simulator testing performed after the accident demonstrated that increasing the thrust levers to the TO/GA detent, as required by SOPs upon the activation of the ""thrust not set"" ECAM message, would have silenced the RETARD aural alert.  At the time of the accident, neither the operator's training program nor manuals provided to flight crews specifically addressed what to do in the event the RETARD alert occurred during takeoff; although, 9 months before the accident, US Airways published a safety article regarding the conditions under which the alert would activate during takeoff. The operator's postaccident actions include a policy change (published via bulletin) to its pilot handbook specifying that moving the thrust levers to the TO/GA detent will cancel the RETARD aural alert. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The captain's decision to reject the takeoff after the airplane had rotated. Contributing to the accident was the flight crew's failure to follow standard operating procedures by not verifying that the airplane's flight management computer was properly configured for takeoff and the captain's failure to perform the correct action in response to the electronic centralized aircraft monitoring alert.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA14MA081 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Flightglobal  CNN  FAA  BEA   Location  Images: photo (c) Rafal Szczypek; Philadelphia International Airport, PA (PHL/KPHL); 28 February 2016 photo (c) Colin Pierce; Philadelphia International Airport, PA (PHL/KPHL); 03 June 2018 photo (c) Jack Goldberg; Philadelphia International Airport, PA (PHL/KPHL); 04 August 2018 photo (c) Paul Kanagie; Philadelphia International Airport, PA (PHL/KPHL); 23 January 2021 photo (c) Paul Kanagie; Philadelphia International Airport, PA (PHL/KPHL); 23 January 2021 photo (c) NTSB; 2014; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; 2014; (publicdomain) photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Washington-Ronald Reagan National Airport, DC (DCA/KDCA); 17 October 2012 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The 2 pilots were not injured. The flight originated at Opa-locka, Florida (OPF), about 09:52. The two flight crewmembers reported that, after landing on runway 36, the pilot, who was the pilot flying, applied the brakes normally; however, the airplane did not decelerate as expected. The pilot applied the brakes a second time, and the right main landing gear tire subsequently failed. The airplane departed the end of runway 36 and came to rest in an area of unfinished gravel, which resulted in structural damage to the airframe.  Examination of the 4,954-feet-long runway revealed that the airplane touched down about 1,400 feet from the approach end. Skid marks were visible for about 2,982 feet, and the tire failure occurred about 3,153 feet into the landing. Examinations revealed that the right main landing gear tire had a flat spot with a 4-inch diameter hole consistent with a locked brake. The airplane was equipped with an optional antiskid wheel braking system; however, it was disabled in 2004. The pilots reported that they decided to land on runway 36 based on the wind at flight level 180 and that they did not check the surface wind at the airport. The surface wind at the airport at the time of the accident was from 158 degrees at 15 knots gusting to 25 knots. Thus, the airplane landed with a significant quartering tailwind, which resulted in it touching down at a location and speed at which the pilots were unable to stop the airplane on the runway using normal braking. The pilots' inadequate in-flight planning and improper selection of runway 36 for landing, which resulted in a significant quartering tailwind during the landing, exceedance of the airplane's braking capability, and a subsequent runway overrun.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA14LA159 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The baggage on board was approx. 50 lbs. There was 2100 lbs. of fuel on board. After boarding of the passengers, the aircraft engines were started at 11:30 hrs. The aircraft taxied out via taxiway D. After ATC departure clearance the aircraft was lined up for take-off. On clearance from ATC the take off roll was initiated and all the parameters were found normal. The rotation was initiated at 98 knots and the aircraft climbed to 10-15 feet AGL. The commander has stated that after lift-off, immediately the left rudder got locked in the forward position resulting in the aircraft yawing and rolling to left. The pilots tried to control it with right bank but the aircraft could not be controlled. Within 3-4 seconds of getting airborne the aircraft impacted the ground in a left bank attitude. The initial impact was on pucca (tar road) and the wing took the first impact loads. After the aircraft came to final halt, the co-pilot opened the door and evacuation was carried out. There was no injury to any of the occupants. Probable cause of the accident: The accident occurred due to stalling of left wing of the aircraft at a very low height. The contributory factors were: - Failure on the part of the crew to effectively put off the yaw damp so as to release the rudder stiffness as per the emergency checklist. - Checklist not being carried out by the crew members. - Not putting off the Rudder Boost. - Speeds call outs not made by co-pilot. - Not abandoning the take-off at lower speed (before V1). - Failure of CRM in the cockpit in case of emergency. - Early rotation and haste to take-off.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB India Report number: 2014-ACC-0 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) Ashishbhatnagar72; Delhi-Safdarjung Airport (/VIDD) [VT]; 30 January 2012; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Flight OC 6393 was a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Petrolina to BrasÃ­lia. While en route, thirty minutes after takeoff, the no.1 hydraulic system showed a loss in pressure. During the approach to BrasÃ­lia, the flight crew used the alternative system for lowering the undercarriage. The main landing gears lowered and locked, but the nose landing gear did not lower. After coordination with the air traffic control, the aircraft was instructed to land on runway 11R. After the touchdown, the aircraft covered a total distance of 900 meters until its full stop. The initial 750 meters were with the aircraft supported only by the main landing gears and the last 150 meters were with the aircraft supported by the main landing gears and by the lower part of the front fuselage. The aircraft stopped on the runway. The aircraft suffered substantial damage to structural elements of the aircraft near the nose section. Contributing factors. - Aircraft maintenance - undetermined. It was found that there was a restriction on the articulation movement of the right nose landing gear door and that the weight of this landing gear was not sufficient to overcome such restriction. Upon inspecting the hinges, it was found that there were no signs of recent lubrication, allowing the hypothesis of occurrence of any deviation or non-adherence to the inspection and lubrication requirements established by the manufacturer leading to a the scenario favorable to the right door movement restriction.  The issue of the maintenance could also be related to some deviation, or nonadherence to the requirements established for the service of widening the holes of the hinges concerning the coating and corrosion protection of the worked surface. As a result, the area could have been more susceptible to corrosive processes. - Project - undetermined. The maintenance program, established by the manufacturer, may have contributed to the occurrence by not establishing adequate preventive maintenance parameters for the landing gear doors that were modified by reworking the hinges, incorporating larger radial pins and widening the lobe holes. - Other - undetermined. It was not possible to determine the causal root of the EDP1 gasket extrusion, which caused the leakage of hydraulic oil that caused the hydraulic system 1 to fail.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CENIPA Report number: A-066/CENIPA/2014 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Onderzoeksraad voor de Veiligheid  G1 Globo History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  11 July 2008 PR-OAF OceanAir 0 SÃ£o Paulo/Guarulhos International Airport (GRU/SBGR), SÃ£o Paulo min Tire failure 21 January 2012 PR-OAF Avianca Brasil 0 near BrasÃ­lia, DF min Fumes/smoke/odor event Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates15-Mar-2024 19:49 ASN Updated [Accident report, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

A post-crash fire erupted. Both pilots were killed. The flight was intended to be the first training flight of the newly hired second-in-command (SIC) pilot. The SIC was operating from the airplane's right seat during the training. The airplane departed Bethel Airport, Alaska, at 15:35. After departure, the airplane began a series of training maneuvers, consistent with normal operations. About 21 minutes into the flight, when the airplane was about 3,400 ft mean sea level, it began a steep descent and subsequently impacted terrain. An airplane performance study showed that the airplane reached a nose-down pitch of about -40 degrees and that the descent rate reached about 16,000 ft per minute.  The NTSB determined that it is likely that the check airman simulated a pitch trim excursion and that the trainee, who lacked experience in the airplane type, did not appropriately respond to the excursion. The check airman did not take remedial action and initiate the recovery procedure in time to prevent the control forces from becoming unmanageable and to ensure that recovery from the associated dive was possible. The aircraft impacted frozen tundra and came to rest in an area of heavy willows. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The check airman's delayed remedial action and initiation of a recovery procedure after a simulated pitch trim excursion, which resulted in a loss of airplane control.""METAR: 00:53 UTC / 16:53 local time: PABE 090053Z 36013KT 10SM CLR M07/M16 A2986 RMK AO2 SLP115 T1072116123:53 UTC / 15:53 local time: PABE 082353Z 02008KT 10SM CLR M07/M16 A2987 RMK AO2 SLP119  T10721161 11072 21139 56002=Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ANC14FA022 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: KTUU  Anchorage Daily News  FAA  NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) Alaska State Troopers; 60 km SE of Bethel, AK; April 2014 photo (c) Alaska State Troopers; 60 km SE of Bethel, AK; April 2014 photo (c) NTSB; 60 km SE of Bethel, AK; April 2014; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; 60 km SE of Bethel, AK; April 2014; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; 60 km SE of Bethel, AK; April 2014; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft was parked at stand J10 at terminal 2G and was ready for a flight bound for Clermont-Ferrand Airport. The apron management services agent asked the flight to be pushed back facing east. The crew of the airplane parked at J11 then also requested pushback. In order to allow this airplane to start its manoeuvre sooner, the apron management services agent then asked the crew of F-HBLF to be towed, with the assistance of a tug, after its pushback, facing south until abeam stand 12 at the end of their pushback.  During the pushback, the crew of F-HBLF started the airplane's two engines, which stabilised at ground idle. Following the pushback from J10, the airplane was on the axis specified in the documentation. In order to position the airplane on the centreline of taxiway E7, the tug driver had to make the airplane make a turn of about 90Â° with a short turn radius. To do this, he positioned his tug at approximately 90Â° to the airplane axis. When the tug began to pull the aircraft, the safety cotter pins on the tow bar coupling head broke. The coupling head was then only connected to the tow bar by an axle around which it could pivot horizontally. Under the effect of its inertia and the thrust of the two engines at idle, the aircraft continued to advance in a straight line. When the coupling head reached the stop, the airplane pivoted towards the right and collided with the tug. This specific pushback and towing procedure was prohibited for stand J10 following two similar previous occurrences. LESSONS LEARNED AND CONCLUSION: The apron management services agent asked that the pushback be followed by a pull forward with the assistance of the tug, despite the ban in the apron management services operations manual on carrying out this manoeuvre on departure from stand J10. The common use of this manoeuvre at the other stands and the absence of any explanation of the reasons for the ban at that specific stand likely led the apron management services agent to request a non-standard procedure. The tug driver did not question the request from the apron management services agent and repeated by the crew of F-HBLF. The operating instructions in fact specify that the latter are ""according to the instructions from ATC and validation by the aircraft captain"". In order to be able to pull the aeroplane, the driver had to set an excessive angle between the tow bar and the aeroplaneÂs axis. The link between the tug and the aeroplane then broke. The aeroplaneÂs inertia following its being moved and the thrust from its engines at idle made the aeroplane move forward, which led to the collision with the tug. Following this event, the apron management services operations manual was modified to make clear the reasons for the ban.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Report number: f-lf140419.en Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) Google Earth; Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG); 14 April 2015 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight to Kikori was uneventful. The pilot stated that he joined the Kikori circuit upwind for a left downwind and, after completing the pre-landing checks, set up for a landing on runway 30. The pilot reported that, after touchdown, he held the nose wheel off the ground. He stated that the initial landing and roll-through on the steel matting surface were normal. When applying brakes, the aircraft veered left and ran off the runway.  The aircraft subsequently impacted an embankment beyond the left side of the runway, approximately 70 metres from the runway end. The nose of the aircraft was crushed and the nose landing gear partially collapsed rearwards during the impact with the embankment. Two of the left propeller blades were bent. Based on the differences between the pilotÂs statements and the statement by the witness, the AIC was unable to ascertain the exact touchdown point.  Prior to the accident flight, the aircraft had undergone a 100-hourly maintenance check at Port Moresby performed by the operatorÂs maintenance provider. The AIC was informed that during this check the brake pads had been changed and the brake system had been bled and refilled with hydraulic fluid.

The aircraft was scheduled to operate three commercial air transport (cargo) sectors: from Athens to Bergamo, then to Paris Charles de Gaulle, and finally East Midlands. The co-pilot completed the pre-flight external inspection of the aircraft in good light, and found nothing amiss. The departure from Athens was uneventful, but a combination of factors affecting Bergamo (including poor weather, absence of precision approach aids, and work in progress affecting the available landing distance) led the crew to decide to route directly to Paris, where a normal landing was carried out. The aircraft departed Paris for East Midlands at 00:40 hrs UTC, loaded with 10 tonnes of freight, 8 tonnes of fuel (the minimum required was 5.6 tonnes), and with the co-pilot as Pilot Flying. Once established in the cruise, the flight crew obtained the latest ATIS information from East Midlands, which stated that runway 27 was in use, although there was a slight tailwind, and Low Visibility Procedures (LVPs) were in force. They planned to exchange control at about FL100 in the descent, for the commander to carry out a Category III autoland. However, as they neared their destination, the weather improved, LVPs were cancelled, and the flight crew re-briefed for an autopilot approach, followed by a manual landing, to be carried out by the co-pilot. The landing was to be with Flap 30, Autobrake 2, and idle reverse thrust. The final ATIS transmission which the flight crew noted before landing stated that the wind was 130/05 kt, visibility was 3,000 metres in mist, and the cloud was broken at 600 ft aal. The captain established radio contact with the tower controller, and the aircraft was cleared to land; the surface wind was transmitted as 090/05 kt. The touchdown was unremarkable, and the autobrake functioned normally, while the co-pilot applied idle reverse thrust on the engines. As the aircraftÂs speed reduced through approximately 60 kt, the co-pilot handed control to the commander, who then made a brake pedal application to disengage the autobrake system. However, the system remained engaged, so he made a second, more positive, brake application. The aircraft ""shuddered"" and rolled slightly left-wing-low as the lower part of the left main landing gear detached. The captain used the steering tiller to try to keep the aircraft tracking straight along the runway centreline, but it came to a halt slightly off the centreline, resting on its right main landing gear, the remains of the left main landing gear leg, and the left engine lower cowl.  The two crew members were uninjured and there was no fire. Conclusions: The damage to the flap system, fuselage, and MLG equipment was attributable to the detachment of the left MLG axle, wheel and brake assembly. The damage to the MLG outer cylinder, engine and nacelle was as result of the aircraft settling and sliding along the runway. The left MLG axle assembly detached from the inner cylinder due to the momentary increase in bending load during the transition from auto to manual braking. The failure was as a result of stress corrosion cracking and fatigue weakening the high strength steel substrate at a point approximately 75 mm above the axle. It is likely that some degree of heat damage was sustained by the inner cylinder during the overhaul process, as indicated by the presence of chicken wire cracking within the chrome plating over the majority of its surface. However, this was not severe enough to have damaged the steel substrate and therefore may have been coincidental. Although the risk of heat damage occurring during complex landing gear plating and refinishing processes is well understood and therefore mitigated by the manufacturers and overhaul agencies, damage during the most recent refinishing process cannot be discounted. The origin of the failure was an area of intense, but very localised heating, which damaged the chrome protection and changed the metallurgy; ie the formation of martensite within the steel substrate. This resulted in a surface corrosion pit, which, along with the metallurgical change, led to stress corrosion cracking, fatigue propagation and the eventual failure of the inner cylinder under normal loading.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: EW/C2014/04/03 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  25 January 2011 VH-TJH Qantas 0 between Adelaide and Melbourne non Location  Images: photo (c) Richard Blower; East Midlands Airport (EMA/EGNX); 29 April 2014 photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Sydney-Kingsford Smith International Airport, NSW (SYD/YSSY); 04 January 2009 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All occupants sustained fatal injuries. The aircraft, HK-4700, operated on a non-scheduled cargo flight from Villavicencio (VVC) to Florencia (FLA). The takeoff weight was 11,430 kg which included a cargo of 2540 kg. A VFR flight plane was filed with an en route altitude of 6500 feet.  Takeoff was accomplished at 11:15 hours local time. Last radio contact with the flight was at 11:44 hours when the crew reported abeam Uribe. As the flight progressed, visibility deteriorated due to clouds and the crew had difficulty maintaining visual flight. The airplane deviated to the west of the planned route in order to remain visual. This took the flight over mountains with an elevation higher than the en route altitude of the aircraft. After losing visual contact with the ground, the airplane impacted the wooded side of a mountain at about 6500 feet. Probable Causes (translated from Spanish) Failure in evaluating the hazards and risks in the flight planning and decision making related to the execution of a VFR flight between the cities of Villavicencio and Florencia, without verifying the area's minimum altitudes. Untimely interruption of a flight in VFR conditions that resulted in an unexpected flight in IMC.

According to the flight crew, duringÂ pushback theyÂ received a new route clearance due to weather along the route.Â  The captain and first officer discussed how they would handle the associated tasks, and agreed they would load the new route and thenÂ contact dispatch after the engine startÂ had been accomplished.Â  The crew stated the interphone conversation quality was degraded due to low volume, and there was considerable radio traffic on both clearance delivery and ramp frequencies.Â  As the flight crew finished coordinating tasks, the captain heard on the interphone what he believed was ""set brakes"" and, because he did not discern any aircraft motion,Â began to apply the brakes.Â  The airplane immediately shook and several warnings went off in cockpit.Â   According to the tug operator,Â while at the gate he received brakes released andÂ clear to push from the flight crew, and heÂ proceeded to push the airplane off of the gate and to the area where it was clear to start engines.Â  As they airplane approached the engine start spot,Â  the tug operator stated ""cleared to start"", and the airplane immediately stopped, and the tug operator saw the airplane nose immediately drop and the nose gear partially collapse.Â  Further inspection revealed the airplane sustained substantial damage to the nose landing gear assembly. Probable Cause: the captain's failure to verify the communications between himself and the tug operator, which resulted in him applying of brakes while the airplane was being pushed back from the gate by the tug with tow bar attached.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA14CA093 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 years and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA14CA093  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates06-Oct-2022 17:18 ASN Update Bot Added Corrections or additions? ...
