There were no injuries among the 30 passengers and three crew members. SOL LÃ­neas AÃ©reas flight 5420 was taxiing for takeoff at Mendoza-El Plumerillo Airport when the crew lost directional control of the aircraft. The airplane exited the taxiway and came to rest on rough terrain. Propeller blades of engine no. 1 were damaged, with shrapnel causing a 5 cm long hole in the fuselage. Aviation sources in Argentina reported in March 2013 that the airplane was considered damaged beyond economical repair. Conclusions: (translated from Spanish) While taxiing to the holding point of the runway in use, the crew of flight 8R5420 lost directional control and departed the taxiway, which resulted in the impact of the aircraft with objects on the ground. This was due to a combination of the following factors: - The electric pump which controls fluid pressure in the hydraulic system was not operational, generating a deficit of fluid pressure in the hydraulic system. - The low fluid pressure warning in the hydraulic system was not recognized by the crew. - The crew could not control the path of the aircraft due to the unavailability of nose wheel steering. - The persistence of an informal practice among the crews of the operator on the operation of the hydraulic system, contrary to the concept of operation of the hydraulic system established by the manufacturer. - The lack of detection of the informal practice on the operation of the hydraulic system by the operator's safety monitoring mechanisms.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JIAAC Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: JIAAC  Susto en Mendoza: se despistÃ³ un aviÃ³n de Sol (Perfil.com, 2-1-2013)   Location  Images: photo (c) Gustavo Lepez; Mendoza-El Plumerillo Airport, MD (MDZ/SAME); February 2013 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There are six persons on board. At 11:32 local time the airplane took off from runway 07 at Los Roques and starting climbing to the planned cruising altitude of 6500 feet. Some seven minutes after takeoff, the pilot radioed that they were 10 NM from the Gran Roque VOR, at an altitude of 5000 feet. The controller instructed the flight to contact Maiquetia Approach, but no contact was established. Radar data showed that the flight continued to climb, reaching 5400 feet at a distance of 13.3 NM from the Gran Roque VOR. Speed was 120 knots. At that point the airplane rapidly started to lose altitude and speed. A piece of luggage that was carried aboard the plane was found late January on the coast of the island of CuraÃ§ao. On February 12, two bags belonging to the occupants of the missing plane were found washed ashore at the island of Bonaire. On June 27, the wreckage was located by a search party.

There was a solid cloud cover in the area and the crewÂs view of Mount Elizabeth was likely to have been obscured. The crew probably received a terrain warning 45 seconds before impact. A climb was initiated, but aircraft climb performance was not sufficient to avoid the terrain. Search and rescue workers made visual contact with the plane's crash site late at night on January 25.

Flight DV760 operated on a domestic flight from Kokshetau Airport (KOV) to Almaty (ALA). Weather forecast obtained by the crew before departure showed a visibility of 800 m at Almaty with a vertical visibility of 90 m, and temporary reduced visibility to 200 meters. The flight took off at 11:19 hours local time. The captain was Pilot Flying. At 12:00 the flight contacted Almaty Control and received the current weather conditions which showed a limited visibility for runway 23R of 200 m. At 12:40 the flight was cleared to descend to FL80. By then visibility had decreased to 175 m. The captain decided to continue descent and prepare for an approach to decision height. The captain became increasingly stressed by the poor weather conditions. After reaching FL80 the crew were told to remain at that altitude because of another flight in the area. This provoked a strong emotional reaction from the captain. At 12:57 the flight was then cleared down to 1600 m. During the descent the lack of improvement of weather conditions caused a greater and greater irritation on the part of the captain. When turning to finals the runway visual range (RVR) for the first, mid and last part of runway 23R was reported as 275-250-225 m in freezing fog with a vertical visibility of 40 meters. With continuing visibility updates the flight crew kept descending until it was clear that a landing was impossible given the lack of visual contact with the ground. A missed approach was initiated at 13:10 from a height of 180 m. The autopilot was disconnected and the TO/GA button was pushed. Engine power increased and the flaps were raised to 8Â°. In the four seconds after pressing to TO/GA button there were no control inputs. Then the captain pushed the control column forward, causing the aircraft to descend. The EGPWS warning sounded as the pitch changed to -9. The observer pilot tried to draw attention on the EGPWS warning but there was no response on the controls by the flight crew. Pitch angle further increased to -16Â° and vertical speed was -20 to -30 m/sec. The aircraft impacted the ground at high speed and a -20Â° pitch angle and broke up. CONCLUSION: (translated from Russian): The accident with aircraft CRJ-200 UP-CJ006 occurred during the execution of a go-around, in instrument meteorological conditions, without the possibility of visual contact with ground reference points (vertical visibility in the fog did not exceed 40 m), the necessity of which was caused by the mismatch between the actual weather conditions and the minimum conditions for which the crew was certified to land. As a result, the deflection of the elevator towards a dive of the aircraft caused a descent and collision with the ground. It was not possible to uniquely identify the causes of the aircraft's transfer to a dive from the available data. The Commission did not find evidence of failures of aviation equipment, as well as external to the aircraft (icing, wind shear, wake turbulence) when trying to perform a go-around.  The most likely factors that led to the accident, were:   - partial loss performance of the pilot in command, which at the time of aircraft impact with the ground was not in a working position;   - the lack of CRM levels in the crew, and violation of the Fly-Navigate-Communicate principle, which manifested itself in diverting attention by the co-pilot to conduct external radio communication and lack of control of the flight instrument parameters;   - the lack of response to the EGPWS and the actions required;   - the impact somatographic illusions of perception of the pitch angle (a nose-up illusion);   - increased emotional stress by the crew members associated with the unjustified expectations of improved weather conditions at the time of landing;   - failure to comply with the requirements for health examination of flight personnel, which led to the pilot in command flying without the rehabilitation period and without assessment of his health status after undergoing surgery.METAR: 07:00 UTC / 13:00 local time: UAAA 290700Z 05001MPS 0150 R23R/0150N R23L/0200N FZFG VV001 M01/M01 Q1019 882/0150 NOSIG RMK QBB040Wind 050 degrees at 1 m/sec (2 knots); Visibility: 150 m; Runway Visual Range of runway 23R: 150 m, and 200 m at runway 23L; Freezing fog; Temperature: -1Â°C; Dewpoint: -1Â°C; Pressure: 1019 mb.07:30 UTC / 13:30 local time: UAAA 290730Z 02001MPS 0150 R23R/0150N R23L/0200N FZFG VV001 M01/M01 Q1018 882/0150 NOSIG RMK QBB040Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: Interfax  Prosecutor General's office of Republic of Kazakhstan  Ministry of Transport   Location  Images: photo (c) MAK; Almaty Airport (ALA); January 2013 photo (c) MAK; Almaty Airport (ALA); January 2013 photo (c) MAK; Almaty Airport (ALA); January 2013 photo (c) MAK; Almaty Airport (ALA); January 2013 photo (c) MAK; Almaty Airport (ALA); January 2013 photo (c) MAK; Almaty Airport (ALA); January 2013 photo (c) MAK; Almaty Airport (ALA); January 2013 photo (c) MAK; Almaty Airport (ALA); January 2013 photo (c) MAK; Almaty Airport (ALA); January 2013 photo (c) MAK; Almaty Airport (ALA); January 2013 photo (c) MAK; Almaty Airport (ALA); January 2013 photo (c) MAK; Almaty Airport (ALA); January 2013 photo (c) Alexander Zaleski; Almaty Airport (ALA); 07 January 2013; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) Vaclav Kudela; Praha-Ruzyne International Airport (PRG/LKPR); 30 January 2010 photo (c) Harro Ranter / ASN; Helsinki-Vantaa Airport (HEL/EFHK); 10 September 2001 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates02-Jan-2025 09:03 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Of the 50 occupants, five sustained serious injuries. Alitalia flight 1670 had departed Pisa-Galileo Galilei Airport (PSA) on a domestic flight to Roma-Fiumicino Airport (FCO). This flight was operated by Carpatair on behalf of Alitalia.  The airplane flew the approach in strong cross wind conditions with wind shear reported at runway 16L some fifteen minutes before the landing. Shortly before touchdown the airplane suddenly lost altitude and impacted the runway with the nose landing gear. This was at a distance of 567 meters from the runway threshold. It bounced three times, causing the nose and main gear to collapse. The airplane slid off the left side of the runway and came to rest in the grass near taxiway DE, at a distance of about 1780 meters from the runway threshold. The aircraft had also performed a rotation on the vertical axis of 170Â°, thus assuming a definitive orientation of about 330Â° magnetic. It came to rest 400 m from fire station no. 1. However, it took the fire services ten minutes to reach the airplane because they were not aware of the precise location of the accident. The airplane landed in strong winds from 250 degrees on runway 16L. Runway 25 at Fiumicino was Notamed not available for landings due to work in progress. The Fiumicino Notam reported at the time of the accident of the following limitations of the runway 16L ILS: - LOCALIZER AT 17NM MRA 3000FT AND AT 25NM MRA 4000FT - GLIDE PATH COVERAGE REDUCED AT 8.5NM The ATR 72-212 has a demonstrated maximum crosswind component of 35 kts on a dry runway. CAUSES: (translated from Italian) The accident is due to the human factor. In particular, it was caused by an improper conduct of the aircraft by the PF (commander) during landing, not consistent with the provisions of the operator's manuals, in an environmental context characterized by the presence of significant criticality (presence of crosswind with values at the limit/excess those allowed for the ATR 72) and in the absence of an effective CRM. The following factors may have contributed to the event. - The failure to carry out the landing briefing, which, in addition to being required by company regulations, would have been an important moment of pooling and acceptance of information fundamental to the safety of operations. - The maintenance of a V APP significantly higher than expected. - The conviction of the commander (PF), deriving from his considerable general and specific experience on the aircraft in question, to be able to conduct a safe landing in spite of the presence of critical wind conditions for the type of aircraft. - The considerable difference in experience between the commander and the first officer, which has reasonably prevented the latter from showing his critical capacity, thus rendering CRM techniques ineffective. After the accident, the application of the PEA revealed some critical issues, which did not allow to carry out in a timely and effective manner the search and rescue of the aircraft and its occupants.METAR: 19:20 UTC / 20:20 local time: LIRF 021920Z 25028G41KT 9999 SCT023 SCT040 11/04 Q0992 WS RWY 16L NOSIGWind 250 degrees at 28 knots, gusting to 41 knots; Visibility: 10+ km; Scattered clouds at 2200 feet AGL and 4000 feet AGL; Temperature: 11Â°C; Dewpoint: 4Â°C; Pressure: 992 mb; Windshear at runway 16L19:50 UTC / 20:50 local time: LIRF 021950Z 25023KT 9999 SCT023 SCT040 11/03 Q0992 NOSIG20:20 UTC / 21:20 local time: LIRF 022020Z 25022G32KT 9999 SCT022 BKN040 11/03 Q0992 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: ANSV Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Repubblica  BEA   Location  Images: photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Nassau International Airport (NAS/MYNN); 04 April 2002 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were 44 passengers and eight crew members on board. Five passengers were killed. Five crew members crew and three passengers were seriously injured. The airplane operated on a charter flight from Odessa (ODS) to Donetsk (DOK), carrying football fans on their way to a match of Shakhtar Donetsk against Borussia Dortmund. When commencing their descent towards Donetsk, the crew received the latest weather observations, which showed limited visibility due to fog. The captain of the flight was certified to carry out approaches to a decision height of 300 m. After reaching decision height the crew did not observe the approach lights of runway 08. The captain continued the approach, descending below 300 m. He did not inform the other flight crew members of his intentions. The co-pilot and flight engineer did not take action to support the speed of the aircraft managing the engine's power settings. The captain then attempted to climb, causing the airspeed to drop to 150 km/h. The airplane stalled and fell off to the right. The airplane impacted the ground at a 48Â° bank angle. The commission investigating the crash concluded that the cause of this accident was a loss of speed by the aircraft during approach due to an error of an unprepared crew, which had not been allowed to make the flight in those weather conditions.METAR: 16:00 UTC / 18:00 local time: UKCC 131600Z 07002MPS 030V090 0250 R08/0750N FG VV001 01/01 Q1026 08290055 BECMG 0200 FG VV001Wind 2m/sec at 070 degrees, varying from 30 to 90 degrees; Visibility: 250 m (820 ft); Runway visual range at runway 08: 750 m (2460 ft); Fog; indefinite ceiling with vertical visibility of 100 feet AGL; Temperature: 1Â°C; Dew point: 1Â°C; Pressure : 1026 mb; Visibility becoming 200 m in fog with a vertical visibility of 100 feet AGL16:30 UTC / 18:30 local time: UKCC 131630Z 00000MPS 0500 R08/1300VP2000D PRFG VV002 01/01 Q1026 08290055 BECMG 0200 FG VV00117:00 UTC / 19:00 local time: UKCC 131700Z 00000MPS 0250 R08/0750N PRFG VV002 01/01 Q1026 08290055 BECMG 0200 FG VV001Visibility: 250 m (820 ft); Runway visual range at runway 08: 750 m (2460 ft); Partial fog; indefinite ceiling with vertical visibility of 200 feet AGL; Temperature: 1Â°C; Dew point: 1Â°C; Pressure : 1026 mb; Visibility becoming 200 m in fog with a vertical visibility of 100 feet AGL.17:30 UTC / 19:30 local time: UKCC 131730Z 00000MPS 0800 R08/0750V1800D PRFG VV001 01/01 Q1026 08290055 BECMG 0200 FG VV001Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NBAAI Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: RIA Novosti  URA-Inform  Interfax-Ukraine (10-4-2013)   Location  Images: photo (c) State Service of Emergency Ukraine; Donetsk Airport (DOK/UKCC); 13 February 2013 photo (c) State Service of Emergency Ukraine; Donetsk Airport (DOK/UKCC); 13 February 2013 photo (c) State Service of Emergency Ukraine; Donetsk Airport (DOK/UKCC); 13 February 2013 photo (c) State Service of Emergency Ukraine; Donetsk Airport (DOK/UKCC); 13 February 2013 photo (c) Volodymyr Moroz; Lvov-Snilow Airport (LWO/UKLL); 01 January 2013 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board concluded that the probable cause of this incident was the aircraftâs encounter with turbulence caused by vortex motion of air currents surrounding a strong jet stream during cruise. At the time, cabin crew members who were gathering and organizing meal service items in the galley fell, sustaining serious injuries as a result.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ARAIB Report number: ARAIB/AAR1302 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: ARAIB  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates14-Nov-2024 09:48 ASN Added 14-Nov-2024 09:56 ASN Updated [Cn, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The copilot was Pilot Flying, the Pilot in Command (PIC) was Pilot Monitoring.  While en route at FL390 the flight crew listened out the ATIS frequency for Berlin-SchÃ¶nefeld, but they failed to hear any airport information. After commencing the descent, the flight was cleared for an ILS approach to runway 07L at Berlin-SchÃ¶nefeld. When passing FL200 in the descent, the Pilot Flying wanted to start the descent checklist, but the Pilot Monitoring wanted to fully listen out the ATIS which was now being received. The ATIS among others stated: ""[...] moderate icing reported below 3 000 feet [...]"". At 08:51 the Pilot Monitoring stated that the temperature was not below zero Celsius and that he wanted to wait before switching on the anti-ice systems. Four minutes later he switched on the Engine Anti-Ice System as temperature had dropped below zero. At 08:57 the flight was cleared to land on runway 07L. When working the Approach checklist, the Pilot Monitoring at the ""icing conditions"" item stated that ""it is still on"". The aircraft was subsequently configured for the final approach and the autopilot was disconnected. The PIC stated that they had visual contact with the runway and that 'everything could be switched off'. He proceeded to switch off the Engine Anti-Ice and Windshield Anti-Ice Systems. As the aircraft was flared over the threshold, the left wing dropped and contacted the runway. The aircraft then rolled right and touched down hard on the right hand main landing gear. The gear leg broke and the aircraft slid along the side of the runway until coming to a stop 447 meters past the runway threshold. A few minutes after the accident, officials noted that a 10 mm layer of ice had accumulated on the aircraft nose, wing leading edge, undercarriage and stabilizer. The PIC stated after the accident that he had not seen any ice accretion on the outer third of the wing and decided not to use the Wing and Horizontal Stabilizer De-Ice System. Activating this system would also have reduced aircraft performance. Causes (translated from German): The aircraft accident is attributable to the following causes: - The crew performed the approach under known icing conditions and did not switch on the Wing and Horizontal Stabilizer De-Ice System, contrary to the standard operating procedures (SOP). - During the flare the aircraft entered a stall due to ice build-up on the wings and tail unit and the fact that the speed fell below the approach speed prescribed for icing conditions, and fell off to the side. Contributing factor: - The crew had insufficient knowledge regarding the relationship between the Ice Protection System and the Stall Warning Protection System (SWPS).Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BFU Report number: BFU CX001-13 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 years and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: BFU CX001-13   Location  Images: photo (c) Jonathan Palombo; 12 March 2012; (CC:by) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

However, the flight then encountered moderate turbulence, during which the flight attendant sustained a serious injury while walking from her bunk to the lavatory. The flight attendant reported that announcements made over the public address system could not be heard in the bunk room and that it was not always possible to hear when the seatbelt sign was turned on or off.

The captain and the co-pilot survived. The remaining five occupants were killed. The airplane departed Nashville-John C. Tune Airport, TN about 18:27 CST on a flight to Thomson-McDuffie County Airport, GA.  According to the cockpit voice recorder (CVR), after the landing gear was lowered, about 20:04, the copilot noted that the ""ANTI SKID FAIL"" annunciator light illuminated. The pilot continued the approach, and, about 20:05, the airplane touched down on runway 10. The takeoff warning horn sounded about 0.3 seconds before the pilot stated that he was performing a go-around. The airplane lifted off near the departure end of the runway. The copilot directed the pilot to increase pitch. According to EGPWS data, as the airplane climbed to an altitude of about 63 ft (19 m) above the ground, about 9 seconds after liftoff, the left wing struck a utility pole located about 0.25 miles (400 m) east of the departure end of the runway. The airplane continued about 925 ft (282 m) before colliding with trees and terrain. It was destroyed by impact forces and a postcrash fire. Runway 10 is a 5503 ft (1677 m) long asphalt runway. The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: ""The pilot's failure to follow airplane flight manual procedures for an antiskid failure in flight and his failure to immediately retract the lift dump after he elected to attempt a go-around on the runway.

The aircraft was stabilized on glide slope and localizer, with an approach airspeed Vapp of 132 kts, for a Vref of 126 kts. Descending through 286ft (Radio Altimeter) the autopilots were disengaged. The aircraft was thereafter flown manually, assisted by the use of flight directors and autothrottle. Below 20 feet at a slightly high descent rate there was a short flare followed by a light bounce with spoilers extended. The ensuing aircraft's natural aerodynamic tendency was an increase in the pitch attitude in conjunction with a pulling force exerted on the control column with a high pitch rate (3Â°/s) and increasing high pitch up attitude (up to 14.82Â°). This manoeuvre, most likely to avoid a hard nose wheel ground contact, made the tail strike the ground. By the time the main landing gear shock absorbers were fully compressed the aircraftÂs pitch angle had exceeded the ground/ tail clearance of 13.2Â°. The aircraft was taxied to the apron and a maintenance preliminary check was performed. The aircraft had sustained serious damage to the underside of the rear fuselage, where the lower skin panels were abraded by contact with the runway surface. In some areas, the skin was buckled through its full thickness and some vertical struts bent the attachment area in the airframe structure. CAUSES OF THE ACCIDENT PRIMARY CAUSE Inadequate recovery handling of a bounced firm landing (deviation from recommended flying pilot technique). CONTRIBUTING FACTORS The following were considered as contributing factors: a) High sink rate prior to and during flare; b) Aircraft firm landing followed by a light bounce; c) Crew momentary unawareness of aircraft position (in the air) and intentional column pulling action, trying to smooth nose wheel contact with ground; d) The presence of a tailwind component during the flare phase above recommended 10kts limits; e) Aircraft's center of gravity at a slightly backward position but this factor is of marginal contribution only; f) The decision to land on damp runway 30, with tailwind component marginal to the maximum permitted (10kts), instead of a circling to land to the actual runway (12) in use or the decision to discontinue the approach via a go-around procedure; g) A bounce recovery at night (with less visual references) characterized by taking place very close to the ground (less than 20 feet) hence allowing for a very short reaction time from the PF and little control effectiveness of the aircraft (throttle retarded and normal configuration to land); h) The existing take-off / landing certification standards, which were based on the attainment of the landing reference speeds, and flight crew training that was based on the monitoring of and response to those speeds, hindering crew to detect degraded landing speed and sink rate.METAR: 20:30 UTC / 19:30 local time: LPPD 022030Z 15014KT 9999 -SHRA SCT016 14/12 Q099721:00 UTC / 20:00 local time: LPPD 022100Z 17013KT 9999 -SHRA SCT015 SCT030 13/12 Q0997Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: GPIAA Report number: 02/ACCID/2013 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane was parked on the platform at Annemasse Airport overnight. The temperature was -2Â°C and humidity was 98% with fog or low clouds as the pilot prepared for a 5-minute VFR flight to GenÃ¨ve-Cointrin Airport (GVA). The pilot started the takeoff from runway 12 at 08:38:18. Rotation occurred 19 seconds later. Several witnesses reported seeing the airplane with a high nose-up pitch attitude, with a low rate of climb. Three seconds after the rotation the ""Bank Angle"" warning, indicating excessive bank, and then the stall warning, was recorded several times on the CVR. Several witnesses saw the airplane turn sharply to the right and then to the left. Fifteen seconds after the rotation, the left main landing gear struck the roof of a house about 500 m from the threshold of runway 30 at Annemasse. The airplane then collided with the ground. During the impact sequence, all three elements in the landing gear and the left wing were torn away from the rest of the aeroplane. It then slid along the ground for a distance of about 100 m before hitting a garden shed, a low wall and some trees in the garden of a second house. The airplane caught fire and came to a stop.

All nine on board were killed. The airplane was chartered by Minera AurÃ­fera Retamas SA (MARSA) to transport seven employees to a mining site. It took off from Lima at 06:25 hours local time, bound for Pias, Peru. After flying over the PÃ­as lagoon and seeing that the surrounding areas were covered by low clouds, especially the stretch from the beginning of the turn to the final leg of approach to the aerodrome, the crew chose to fly over the aerodrome in the opposite direction to the landing (140Â°). The flight then turned to the right and moved away on a course of approximately 170Â°, in order to make, a teardrop approach at low altitude and intercept the landing trajectory at heading 320Â°. While in landing configuration, the aircraft began a pronounced left turn at low altitude, approximately 4 km from the aerodrome, flying very close to the high and low voltage power lines installed parallel to the entrance ravine. The aircraft hit two cables of and subsequently impacted a slope of a ravine at 07:41 hours. A post-impact fire erupted. PROBABLE CAUSE: Loss of control of the aircraft due to impact with high-voltage cables, caused by the loss of visual references during approach to land at the PIAS aerodrome, in inappropriate weather conditions. CONTRIBUTOR FACTORS: Inadequate meteorological information provided by the PIAS aerodrome flight coordinator that did not reflect the actual weather condition of the area. Lack of a procedure card to carry out the descent, approach, landing and takeoff atPIAS, considering the visual and operational meteorological limitations in the area.

The aircraft was substantially damaged, and there were no injuries to the 148 occupants. Weather at the time of the event was reported as winds from 340 degrees at 6 knots, clear skies and 10 miles visibility. According to the flight crew, the preflight, departure and enroute segments of the flight were normal. The approach was flown with a Vref speed of 129 knots and 25 degrees of flap. Upon landing, the first officer called ""speedbrakes not activated"" and manually deployed the speedbrakes. The captain reported he felt the airplane ""float"" and attempted to maintain landing attitude. FDR data indicated that the airplane made an initial touchdown, followed by a brief gear squat switch deactivation, consistent with a slight bounce or light touchdown; the speedbrakes were then manually deployed. Airspeed decayed to approximately 115 knots and pitch attitude increased to about 11 degrees. The Delta 757/767 Flight Crew Training Manual specifies that contact with the runway is possible with pitch attitude greater than 10.5 degrees, with flaps 25 and airspeed of 10 knots below Vref. The airplane rolled out and taxied to the gate uneventfully. While preparing the aircraft for the next flight the flight crew was informed by maintenance personnel of damage to the tail section of the aircraft. Aircraft inspection revealed an 8 foot scrape on the lower aft fuselage, damage to several stringers and buckling of the aft pressurization dome.

Both crew members were not injured. Bin Air flight BID-3B originated in Manston International Airport, UK (MSE).  The aircraft was cleared to land on runway 10 at Dublin. The approach was a CAT 1 approach. Weather conditions at Dublin were poor with visibility approximately 1,100 metres and a cloudbase of approximately 300 ft. Dublin was operating in low visibility abeyance. Runway Visual Ranges (RVRs) at 08:28 hrs were 1,600 m at touchdown, 1,800 m at midpoint and 1.600 m at stopend. The aircraft broke out of cloud at about 650 ft, approximately 200 ft above the minimum for the CAT 1 approach, and the pilots could see three white Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) lights. As per normal procedure, after landing the First Officer who was Pilot Flying (PF) gave the controls to the captain who was Pilot Not Flying (PNF) so the he (PF) could complete the ""Leaving the Runway"" checklist. This checklist is completed from memory and included booster pump and flap-to-zero selections. The PNF recalled that during the landing roll, while the aircraft was braking and the indicated airspeed was below 90 kts, the nose gear suddenly collapsed. Both propellers contacted the runway surface and the aircraft quickly came to a halt resting on its nose. The Flight Crew then shutdown both engines, requested fire service assistance, selected batteries & generators to OFF and evacuated the aircraft through the cabin door. The Airport Fire Fighting personnel were on the scene within two minutes. There was no fire. The PF reported that it was a foggy day and that the approach was flown on limits with a lot of tension because of the uncertainty as to whether the aircraft would be able to land at Dublin. He described how concerns that fog might roll in raised his stress levels during the approach. During the landing roll, the landing gear selector was inadvertently moved to the UP position. This mistake was immediately recognised and the selector was returned to the DOWN position, but the nose-wheel retraction, which had been initiated, continued. The PF was unable to say definitively why the landing gear selector may have been mis-selected to UP, but he said that the intention may have been to move the Flap Selector instead. PROBABLE CAUSE: 1. Inadvertent selection of the landing gear selector to the UP position during the landing roll. CONTRIBUTORY CAUSES: 1. Reduced task focus by the PF following a tense and stressful limits approach. 2. Inactive landing gear interlock protection system due to the aircraft speed.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIU Report number: AAIU Report No. 2013-010 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) Timo Blossfeld; Hamburg-FuhlsbÃ¼ttel Airport (HAM/EDDH); 25 May 2008 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Both crew members were killed. The flight had originally departed Anchorage, AK (ANC) about 05:44, and made a scheduled stop at King Salmon, AK (AKN), before continuing on to the next scheduled stop, Dillingham, AK (DLG). As the airplane approached Dillingham, the flight crew requested the RNAV GPS 19 instrument approach to the Dillingham Airport about 07:57 from controllers at the Anchorage Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC). The ARTCC specialist on duty subsequently granted the request by issuing the clearance, with instructions to proceed direct to the Initial Approach Fix (IAF) to begin the approach, and to maintain an altitude of 2,000 feet or above. A short time later the flight crew requested to enter a holding pattern at the IAF so that they could contact the Flight Service Station (FSS) for a runway conditions report, and the ARTCC specialist granted that request. The ARTCC specialist then made several attempts to contact the aircraft, but was unsuccessful and subsequently lost radar track on the aircraft. An ELT signal indicated it had come down in the Muklung Hills. The wreckage was located the next day at an altitude of 2000 feet on the south side of the Muklung Hills. The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The flight crew's failure to maintain terrain clearance, which resulted in controlled flight into terrain in instrument meteorological conditions. Contributing to the accident were the flight crew's failure to correctly read back and interpret clearance altitudes issued by the air traffic controller, their failure to adhere to minimum altitudes depicted on the published instrument approach chart, and their failure to adhere to company checklists.METAR: 16:45 UTC / 08:45 local time: PADL 081645Z 10017G30KT 7SM -RA OVC015 01/01 A2909Wind 100 degrees at 17 knots, gusting to 30 knots; Visibility: 7 miles; light rain; overcast cloud deck at 1500 feet AGL; Temperature: 1Â°C, dew point: 1Â°CAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ANC13FA030 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Anchorage Daily News   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; ca 32 km N of Dillingham, AK; March 2013; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; ca 32 km N of Dillingham, AK; March 2013; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; ca 32 km N of Dillingham, AK; March 2013; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; ca 32 km N of Dillingham, AK; March 2013; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; ca 32 km N of Dillingham, AK; March 2013; (publicdomain) photo (c) Timo Blossfeld; Anchorage-Ted Stevens International Airport, AK (ANC/PANC); 09 June 2011 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Two of the four persons on board were killed. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the business flight that departed Tulsa-Richard Lloyd Jones Jr. Airport, OK (RVS), at 13:58 CDT. According to preliminary air traffic control information, at 16:10, the accident pilot established radio communications with South Bend Approach Control while at 11,000 feet mean sea level (msl). The air traffic controller cleared the flight direct to KNUTE intersection and told the pilot to expect a visual approach to runway 9R. At 16:11, the flight was cleared to descend to 10,000 feet msl. At 16:13, the flight was cleared to 3,000 feet msl. At 16:15, the approach controller told the pilot to make a 5-degree left turn to align with runway 9R and asked the pilot to report when he had the airport in sight. At 16:15:07, the pilot declared an emergency because of a lack of engine power, reporting that they were ""dead stick"" and without any power. About 23 seconds later, at 16:15:30, the pilot transmitted ""we've lost all power, and we have no hydraulics."" When the controller asked if the airplane remained controllable, the pilot replied ""ah, barely controllable."" The controller advised that all runways at South Bend were available for landing and issued the current winds, which were 130-degrees at 10 knots. At 16:15:22, the pilot transmitted that the airplaneÂs navigational systems were inoperative and requested a radar vector toward the airport. The controller replied that the airport was 9 miles directly ahead of the airplane's current position. At 16:16:12, the controller told the pilot to turn 10-degrees left to intersect runway 9R. At 16:16:15, the pilot replied ""26DK, turning left."" No additional voice communications were received from the accident airplane. The approach controller continued to transmit radar vectors toward runway 9R without any response from the accident pilot. At 16:18:58, the approach controller told the accident airplane to go-around because the main landing gear was not extended. (The tower controller had informed the approach controller that only the nose landing gear was extended) The accident airplane was then observed to climb and enter a right traffic pattern for runway 9R. The airplane made another landing approach to runway 9R with only the nose landing gear extended. Several witnesses observed the airplane bounce several times on the runway before it ultimately entered a climbing right turn. The airplane was then observed to enter a nose low descent into a nearby residential community. The airplane came down in a street, crashing into a house near the 1600 block of N. Iowa Street, South Bend. The accident location is approx 1000 metres south of the end of runway 09R. Factual information released by the NTSB suggest that the pilot-rated passenger was allowed to fly the descent under supervision of the captain. The pilot-rated passenger had accumulated 1,576 hours in multi-engine airplanes and 301 hours in single-engine airplanes. He had no experience in turbine-powered business jets. During the descent the captain instructed the passenger to ""just pull the power out"" in order to slow the airplane down. Apparently the passenger lifted the pull-up locks on the throttles and retarded the throttles beyond flight idle, into the fuel cut-off position. The pilot told the pilot-rated-passenger ""you went back behind the stops and we lost power."" During the approach the pilot was able to restart engine number 1. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The private pilot's inadequate response to the dual engine shutdown during cruise descent, including his failure to adhere to procedures, which ultimately resulted in his failure to maintain airplane control during a single-engine go-around. An additional cause was the pilot's decision to allow the unqualified pilot-rated passenger to manipulate the airplane controls, which directly resulted in the inadvertent dual engine shutdown.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN13FA196 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years Download report:  Final report Sources: ADN.com  Flightaware  WSBT   Location  Images: photo (c) Mark Parren; near South Bend Regional, IN (SBN); 17 March 2013 photo (c) NTSB; near South Bend Regional, IN (SBN); 18 March 2013 photo (c) NTSB; near South Bend Regional, IN (SBN); 18 March 2013 photo (c) NTSB; near South Bend Regional, IN (SBN); 18 March 2013 photo (c) NTSB; near South Bend Regional, IN (SBN); 18 March 2013 photo (c) Walt Barkley; La Verne-Brackett Field, CA (POC/); 04 May 2012 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

One of the two crew members was killed. The airplane was flying to an agricultural field for a crop spraying flight on March 22 when it suffered a loss of engine power. A forced landing was carried out and it was established that the carburettor had failed. The carburettor was replaced and the engine was test run. On March 23 the airplane took off again. Shortly after takeoff the engine lost power. The pilot was forced to ditch the plane in a pond. The airplane flipped over and came to rest inverted in the pond. Probable cause (translated from Russian): The cause of the crash of the AN-2 RA-02203 was a nose-over during a forced landing on the water surface. The emergency landing was caused by falling power and auto shutdown of the engine in flight because of the destruction of the exhaust manifold header pipe and carburetor intake valve burnout with the further penetration of exhaust gas with high temperature in the carburetor of the engine input device. The destruction of the exhaust manifold header pipe, most probably originated on the mechanism of corrosion under tension in the heating of the material during operation of the engine on automobile gasoline. Power factor that led to the formation of an initial crack most probably were the residual stresses in the material production of origin, arising in the process of making the header pipe. According to the documentation the last overhaul of the manifold was made at 27.01.2009 at Shakhtinskiy RHA DOSAAF. Based on the submitted documents, the Commission has found no evidence of actual repairs on the manifold, as the marking on the only remaining tag indicates that the section was overhauled at plant No. 420GA in October 1983.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: State Emergency Ministry Krasnodar region  MAK Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC)   Location  Images: photo (c) State Emergency Ministry Krasnodar region; near Vostochnaya, Ust'-Labinsk Region; 23 March 2013 photo (c) MAK Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC); near Vostochnaya, Ust'-Labinsk Region; 24 March 2013 photo (c) MAK Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC); near Vostochnaya, Ust'-Labinsk Region; March 2013 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

On approach to runway 10, the captain and first officer discussed approach and landing considerations due to the strong crosswinds, and it was decided that the first officer would continue the approach. Immediately prior to landing, the first officer experienced difficulty, so control of the aircraft was transferred to the captain. The transfer of control was completed less than 2 seconds prior to landing. The aircraft touched down on the left main wheel, bounced, and landed hard on the nosewheel; the nose landing gear collapsed due to overstress failures. Directional control was lost, and the aircraft skidded on its nose and came to rest 96 feet off the north side of the runway. There were no injuries, and the aircraft was substantially damaged. The investigation determined that, when control of the aircraft was passed to the captain, there was insufficient time to position the aircraft for a successful landing due to the substantial crosswind. The Air Labrador Twin Otter standard operating procedures (SOPs) do not state when the captain should permit the first officer to act as pilot flying or relieve the first officer from that role. When allowing the first officer to fly in challenging conditions, the captain must be prepared to take control of the aircraft in adequate time to ensure the safety of the flight. Also, there is an increased risk of a landing accident if a required briefing is not conducted. Crew members may not share a common plan for the approach and landing, and, as in this case, transfer of control may not be conducted in a timely manner. Findings as to causes and contributing factors: 1. The captain permitted the first officer to continue with a challenging approach. 2. Control of the aircraft was passed to the captain with insufficient time to position the aircraft for a successful landing. 3. The aircraft landed hard, resulting in the collapse of the nose gear due to overstress failures. Findings as to risk: 1. If a required briefing is not conducted, the crew members may not share a common plan for the approach and landing, and the transfer of control may not be completed in a timely manner, increasing the risk of a landing accident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A13A0033 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were no injuries.  The airplane operated flight ML7817 from Dakar, Senegal to Lyon, France with an en route stop at Agadir, Morocco. The crew performed an ILS Category 1 (CAT I) approach to runway 36R. The weather conditions are such that operating low visibility procedures (LVP) prevailed. During the transition from the stabilization of height 1000 ft, the aircraft speed was 57 knots greater than the approach speed. At 140 feet, an inappropriate increase in thrust by autothrottles maintained the aircraft at a high speed. The aircraft landed long and the touched down 1600 meters after the 36R threshold. The plane overran at a speed of 75 knots and came to rest about 300 meters beyond the runway end. Causes of the Accident: Continuing an approach below the stabilisation height with a speed significantly higher than the approach speed shows that the crew were not adequately aware of the situation, even though they mentioned several times their doubts on the marginal meteorological conditions and on the difficulties in reducing the aeroplaneÂs speed. Continuing this unstabilised approach at an excessive approach speed triggered, below 150 ft, an uncommanded increase in engine thrust. The crewÂs delayed A/THR reduction below 20 ft made it impossible for the aeroplane to slow down sufficiently for about 15 seconds after passing the threshold. After descending through 20 ft, the copilotÂs inappropriate flare technique and the dual input phenomenon caused by the Captain significantly lengthened the flare phase. The remaining runway distance after the touchdown made it impossible for the aeroplane to stop before the end of the runway. The following factors contributed to continuing the unstabilised approach and the long flare: - a flight duty period of nearly 15 hours which likely led to crew fatigue; - incomplete preparation of the approach which meant the crew was not aware of the risks on the day (tailwind, wet runway); - the non-application of ATC procedures that require controllers to ensure aircraft are provided with localiser interception at the latest 10 NM from the runway threshold, with a maximum convergence of 30Â° and a maximum speed of 160 kt; - partial application of standard procedures (SOP), impaired task sharing and degraded CRM, which meant the crew was unable to manage optimally the aeroplaneÂs deceleration. These factors contributed to a progressive deterioration in situational awareness that meant that they could not envisage rejecting the approach and landing; - the A/THR anomaly which maintained the aeroplane at a high energy level during the landing phase; - an inadequate procedure for taking over the controls that led to the dual input phenomenon. The following organisational factors contributed to the crewÂs poor performance: - the choice of flight crew recruitment profiles by the operator, motivated by economic considerations, and inadequate airline conversion, led to operating aeroplanes with crews that were relatively inexperienced on type and in their roles as captain or copilot; - improper and inappropriate application of the regulatory provisions that allow an extension of flight duty time in case of ""unexpected circumstances"" without taking into account the predictable risk of excessive fatigue for the crew; - the absence of suitable initial oversight which made it impossible for the HCAA to focus on the predictable potential operational weaknesses of Hermes Airlines.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Report number: sx-s130329.en Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  2 February 2016 SX-BHS Daallo Airlines, lsf Hermes Airlines 1 near Mogadishu International Airport (MGQ) sub Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane incurred substantial damage and there were no injuries to the 192 occupants. The captain was the pilot flying and the first officer was the pilot monitoring. According to flight crew statements, the takeoff, climb, cruise and descent were uneventful. Prior to descent, the captain briefed a visual approach to runway 25L at LAS, which would be backed up by the instrument landing system (ILS). He also included a brief of the A321's 7.5 degree pitch limit. The crew reported that visual meteorological conditions with light and variable winds were initially reported at LAS, however, the winds (VMC) became gusty around the time of the accident. The captain stated that, once he turned off the autopilot while on the approach to runway 25L, he thought ""the winds seemed a little stronger..."" than what was reported, and it felt ""a little squirrelly"". According to the flight crew, the approach was stabilized, on speed, and on glide path. Flaps were selected FULL and autobrakes were selected LOW. The approach speed was 158 knots. When the captain began to initiate the flare within about 20 feet above the ground and pitched up ""just a tad"" for the flare, but stated he did not feel any pitch response, so he brought the nose up a little more to arrest the descent. Upon initial touchdown, he estimated that they bounced about 5-10 feet back into the air and the airplane struck its tail on the second touchdown.  Postaccident investigation revealed substantial damage to the underbelly and aft bulkhead area. The skin was abraded over a large area through its thickness in several areas of the pressure vessel . One frame was fractured along with several fractured shear ties and frame clips. Probable Cause: the captain's improper recovery from a bounced landing which resulted in a tailstrike.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA13FA071 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 7 years Download report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft had been in Lanseria Airport for a maintenance check. Prior to the planned flight, the aircraft underwent flight check for 45 minutes after completed planned maintenance on April 6th, flown by the Captain and another pilot. The aircraft departed FALA to FYOA for its first stop over with a flight time of 03:35h. The planned departure from FYOA was delayed due to trouble in starting the right engine. The aircraft took off at 10:21 hrs contrary to planned 08:30 hrs. For the second leg of the flight, the aircraft departed FYOA to FPST with a filed flight plan of 5 hours and 20 minutes (flight time) having FYOA as alternate. Leaving the Namibian airspace the pilot only contacted Luanda ATC and SÃ£o TomÃ© Tower as destination. At the time of the flight the west coast of Africa in the vicinity of Gulf of Guinea had widespread moderate to severe thunderstorm activity with lighting and heavy rain. When initiating descent to SÃ£o TomÃ© from FL 200 to 4000 feet as instructed by SÃ£o TomÃ© ATC, the pilot was advised that weather was gradually deteriorating at the airport. At 16:10 hrs the pilot had the last radio contact with SÃ£o TomÃ© Tower, informing them about his position which was 9 nm inbound to SÃ£o TomÃ© VOR at 4000 feet and also informed the ATC that he was encountering heavy rain. Having lost contact with the aircraft at 16:13 hrs, the SÃ£o TomÃ© ATC tried several times to contact the airplane  A Search and Rescue operation started on 7 April 2013 the same day the accident occurred and was conducted on the sea and on the island; no trace of aircraft or its debris, pilot or any cargo were found. The search was terminated on 20 April at 1730hrs. Probable Causal Factors By the fact that there is no evidence of the crash, the cause of the accident cannot be conclusively decided, however the investigation discovered series of discrepancies and non-compliance which includes: a. Pilot: i. Planned long flight as solo pilot from Lanseria to Bamako is excessive for pilot fatigue perspective (over 15 hours flying). ii. The First Class FAA (USA) medical Certificate issued on April 23rd 2012 had expired on October 31st 2012. b. Meteorological Conditions: i. Adverse weather conditions enroute and on arrival on that day, the west coast of Africa in the vicinity of Gulf of Guinea had widespread moderate to severe thunderstorm activity with lighting and heavy rain. When initiating descent to Sao Tome, the pilot was advised that weather was gradually deteriorating at airport vicinity.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CNIPAIA Report number: GT/07/04/2013/RF Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 years and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Angop  Small Plane With U.S. Pilot Missing Off West Africa (AP, 12-4-2013)   Location  Images: photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Lanseria Airport (HLA/FALA); January 2004 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

While taking off after a touch-and-go landing, a takeoff configuration warning was generated. The commander rejected the takeoff and brought the aircraft to a halt on the remainder of the runway. The nose landing gear sustained some damage as the aircraft de-rotated on to the nosewheel during the manoeuvre. The crew did not consider the touchdown on the nose landing gear to be excessive and were not aware of the damage.  After a short delay, the training detail was continued. On the subsequent takeoff, with the co-pilot as PF, an ECAM message, l/g shock absorber fault was generated. This meant that the landing gear could not be retracted and that the autopilot and autothrust were unusable. During the climbout the aircraft started to descend so the commander took control and resumed the climb to circuit altitude.  After considering the status of the aircraft, the commander cancelled the training detail and the aircraft was diverted to a maintenance base. The available evidence suggested that the configuration warning resulted from the speed brake lever being inadvertently placed in the speed brake range, during the touch-and-go landing, in such a position that it did not command spoiler surface deflection. The timing of this selection indicated that it occurred when the ground spoilers were being disarmed by the commander pressing the lever downwards. This then caused the takeoff config warning to be activated after takeoff power was set, and the commander rejected the takeoff.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: EW/C2013/04/01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: 1. https://www.gov.uk/aaib-reports/airbus-a320-214-g-ozby-10-april-2013  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates11-Jul-2014 10:12 harro Added 18-Dec-2014 15:18 Dr. John Smith Updated [Date, Location, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Embed code, ]31-Oct-2024 07:55 ASN Updated [Other fatalities, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

Flight JT-904 departed originated at Palu Airport (PLW), Indonesia and was bound for Denpasar (DPS), Indonesia with en route stops at Balikpapan Airport (BPN), Banjarmasin Airport (BDJ) and Bandung Airport (BDO). The flight departed Bandung at 13:45 with the copilot as Pilot Flying. About 15:00 the flight was descending towards Bali and the crew received vectors for a VOR DME approach for runway 09. At 15:08, with the aircraft at approximately 1,600 ft AGL, the Tower controller saw the aircraft on finals and gave a landing clearance with additional information that the wind condition was 120Â° at 5 kts. While descending through 900 feet the copilot stated that the runway was not in sight. Since the captain noted a flashing light at the beginning of the runway, he responded: ""OK. Approach light in sight, continue"". At 15:09:33, after the EGPWS called out ""Minimum"" at an altitude of approximately 550 ft AGL, the pilot disengaged the autopilot and the auto throttle and continued the descent. The airplane then entered an area of rainfall and the outside environment became totally dark. At 150 ft AGL the captain took over control. The copilot handed the control to the captain and stated that he could not see the runway. At 15:10:01, the EGPWS called out ""Twenty"", and the captain commanded a go around. One second later the aircraft impacted the water. The aircraft stopped facing to the north at about 20 meters from the shore or approximately 300 meters south west of the beginning runway 09. Contributing Factors: - The aircraft flight path became unstable below minimum descends altitude (MDA) with the rate of descend exceeding 1000 feet per minute and this situation was recognized by both pilots. - The flight crew loss of situational awareness in regards of visual references once the aircraft entered a rain cloud during the final approach below minimum descends altitude (MDA). - The PIC decision and execution to go-around was conducted at an altitude which was insufficient for the go-around to be executed successfully. - The pilots of accident aircraft was not provided with timely and accurate weather condition despite the weather around the airport and particularly on final approach to the airport was changing rapidly.METAR: 07:00 UTC / 15:00 local time: WADD 130700Z 09006KT 9999 BKN017 30/26 Q1007 NOSIG07:30 UTC / 15:30 local time: WADD 130730Z 15006KT 110V270 9999 FEW017CB SCT017 30/25 Q1007 NOSIGWind 150Â°, varying between 110 and 270Â° at 6 knots; unlimited visibility; few Cumulonimbus clouds at 1700 feet AGL; scattered clouds at 1700 feet AGL; Temperature: 30Â°C; Dewpoint: 25Â°C; Pressure: 1007 mb08:00 UTC / 16:00 local time: WADD 130800Z 10009KT 9999 FEW017CB SCT017 30/26 Q1007 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSC Report number: KNKT.13.04.09.04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) Leslie Snelleman; Jakarta-Soekarno-Hatta International Airport (CGK/WIII); 04 April 2013 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates09-Feb-2025 14:11 ASN Updated [Departure airport, Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The climb and cruise phases of the flight were uneventful. At 17:20, having descended to FL150, the captain, who was Pilot Flying, handed over controls to the first officer to enable him to manually fly the remainder of the descent until final approach although the first officer had voiced his concerns as he had not yet accumulated 100 hours on the A321 since his checkride.  The descent was continued as the airplane was positioned for an ILS approach to runway 16. At 17:34 the tower controller reported the ceiling at the airport to be 200 feet. At that time the captain took over control from the first officer and became Pilot Flying again. At minimums the captain reported seeing the runway and stated, ""continue, in sight."" The airspeed then decreased to below the planned Vapp of 138 knots. At 17:37 the airplane passed the threshold at 131 knots. The airplane touched down 155 meters past the threshold at a speed of 136 knots and a vertical gravity of 1,965 g. Pitch angle was 6.7Â° and touchdown occurred at an angle of attack of 15.5Â°. The aircraft bounced as thrust was increased, touching down again about 491 meters from the threshold. Pitch angle was 10.9Â° and the angle of attack was 23.2Â° with a vertical gravity of 1.715 g. The underside of the tail contacted the runway, causing substantial abrasion damage 100 cm wide and 600 cm long, including wear-through. Eleven interior frames were cracked. The Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board (ARAIB) determines that the causes of this accident were: 1) The pilot flying (PF) failed to maintain the proper approach speed until the flare just before touchdown, and the airplane bounced on touchdown since higher-than-normal vertical gravity was applied due to a high sink rate and increased thrust and speed just before touchdown; and 2) The airplane made a second touchdown at the pitch attitude exceeding an A321 airplane's limitation and sustained a tail strike since the PF failed to keep thrust at idle and establish the proper pitch attitude during the bounce.  Contributing to this accident were: 1) the inadequate training program dealing with the recovery form the bounce;  2) lack of pre-landing preparation due to a failure to conduct an approach briefing on pitch attitude;  3) the PF's failure to properly allocate his attention due to his delegation of flight control to the pilot monitoring (PM) who failed to meet flight control requirements;  4) the PM's inadequate advice and monitoring due to the PF's failure to make standard callouts;  5) the disconnection of the autothrottle and a failure to manually control thrust and speed; and  6) a failure to execute a go-around when stabilized approach criteria are not met.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ARAIB Report number: ARAIB/AAR1303 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

At 14:58 AeromÃ©xico flight 002 took off from Madrid on a scheduled flight to Mexico City, Mexico. On board were three pilots, six flight attendants and 154 passengers. During takeoff the tail impacted runway 36L, causing substantial damage to the underside of the tail. While climbing to FL140 the cabin failed to pressurize as expected. Then the oxygen masks deployed in the cabin. At 15:20 the flight crew informed the controller at Madrid that they were returning due to pressurization problems. The airplane entered a holding pattern and landed safely on runway 18R at 16:25. Air Europa flight 71 to Caracas, Venezuela took off at 15:29 and suffered a punctured nose gear tyre, probably after running over debris left on the runway after the AÃ©romexico tailstrike. AEA71 was the seventh flight to take off from runway 36L following the AeromÃ©xico plane. The Airbus A330-200, EC-JPF, entered a holding pattern off the southern coast of Portugal at FL100 and landed safely back at Madrid at 19:39. Causes (translated from Spanish): The accident occurred because the aircraft rotated at a speed much lower than necessary because it had been incorrectly calculated during the dispatch, based on the weight of the aircraft with zero fuel (ZFW) instead of the takeoff weight of the aircraft (TOW). Then the error was not detected by the crew when entering data into the FMS. Contributing factors: - The On-Board Performance Tool (OPT) was recently introduced in the company. - The experience of both the dispatch officer as well as crew members was insufficient in this area. - The On-Board Performance Tool (OPT) was not installed at the Madrid station so that the transmission of the information was not performed according to procedures.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIAIAC Report number: A-010/2013 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: CIAIAC   Location  Images: photo (c) Kentaro Iemoto; Tokyo-Narita Airport (NRT/RJAA); 16 July 2011; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane was based at Kandahar and operated by the US Air Force on a combat intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) mission. The airplane, callsign Independence 08, departed Kandahar at 11:57 and entered orbit at 12:29. Upon entering the operating area about 12:29, they encountered a cloud deck partially covering their orbit area and a large, rapidly building towering cumulous cloud in the center of their orbit area from 17,000 ft to 24,000 ft mean sea level (MSL). The towering cumulus clouds began to grow and drift into the airplane's orbit, prompting a request to climb from 20,000 ft to 23,000 ft. This translates to climbing from 13,800 to 16,800 ft above ground level. The airplane was in a left hand orbit, preparing to shift the orbit, when the pilot initiated the climb with the autopilot on at 12:40:40. While or just after initiating the climb, the pilot continued working an orbit adjustment to better service tracking an active target, and approximately ten seconds after the climb was initiated, the climb rate increased. Fifteen seconds afterward the pilot noticed he had allowed the airspeed to decrease during the climb, stating, ""A little slow, correcting."" Seven seconds later, the mission commander in the right hand seat said, ""Alright, firewall,"" meaning to advance the throttles as far forward as they would go, and one second later, the auto-pilot was disengaged. The propellers on the MC-12W do not counter-rotate, and advancing the power in the MC-12W produces left-handed torque and P-factor, creating a left yaw and making the aircraft to want to turn left; the airplane was already in a left-hand turn and left bank. Two seconds after calling to ""firewall"" the throttles, and one second after auto-pilot disengagement, the bank angle warning tone sounded, indicating the left bank had rapidly increased to greater than 50 degrees. The mission commander again called for full power, and four seconds later, he directed ""eyes inside,"" telling the pilot to refer to his instruments for attitude and airspeed information; contemporaneously, the stall warning sounded. The stall warning horn stopped after five seconds, and a second later, background noise indicates items began flying around within the cockpit and the bank angle warning stopped. The pilot stated: ""Whoa, pull up"". The mission commander then advised the pilot to look at his airspeed and took over the aircraft, calling for a reduction in power. Four seconds after the mission commander took the aircraft, the aircraft overspeed warning sounded, followed by the landing gear horn sounding. The landing gear horn indicates the throttles were reduced toward idle, and it did not sound until 15 seconds after initial stall warning sounded. The MA reached a maximum recorded height of 20,900 ft. and lost approximately 15,000 ft before impacting the ground. The airplane impacted with the fuselage slightly nose-low, in a left bank, with minimal forward momentum. The airplane was destroyed upon impact and burned during the post-crash fire . CONCLUSION: ""I find by clear and convincing evidence the cause of the mishap was a stall due to insufficient airspeed, while in a climbing left turn, which developed into a left spin followed quickly by a high-speed spiral, from which the crew was unable to recover. Additionally, I find, by a preponderance of evidence, each of the following three factors substantially contributed to the  mishap: (1) orbit weather that impeded visibility and masked the horizon; (2) pilot inexperience in the MC-12W; and (3) known MC-12W program risks associated with sustaining required combat capability in theater.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: USAF AIB Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Army Times   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

All seven crew members were killed in the accident. The accident flight was operated as part of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) to transport military equipment. The original schedule was for the crew to operate flight NCR510 from Chateauroux, France to Camp Bastion, Afghanistan, and then continue to the Dubai World Center at Al Aktoum, UAE. Because no Pakistan over-flight permit was obtained, the flight was re-routed as NCR102 to operate from Camp Bastion to Bagram, refuel, and continue NCR102 from Bagram to Dubai.  According to the load manifest, while in Camp Bastion, the airplane was loaded by National Air Cargo ground personnel with 94,119 kg of cargo, including 5 Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) armored military vehicles that were loaded on the main deck of the airplane. Two of these vehicles weighed about 12 tons each, and the other three weighed about 18 tons each. It was the first time National Airlines had transported 18-ton military vehicles when they were loaded on the accident airplane in Camp Bastion. The airplane departed Camp Bastion at 07:45Z and arrived into Bagram at 09:23Z (13:53 local time). On arrival into Bagram, the crew experienced a brake overheat condition after landing on runway 03. The crew parked the airplane on the Foxtrot ramp and ran a checklist to address the brake temperature indications in the cockpit, and discussed the required cooling time of 1 to 1.5 hours.  The crew did not take on any additional cargo in Bagram, and only took on fuel for the flight to Dubai.  At about 14:27 hours local time while the airplane was still on the ramp in Bagram, the captain was made aware of a broken strap found by one of the other crewmembers, and the cockpit crew had a discussion about a possible shift of the cargo load during landing in Bagram. There was additional discussion on re-securing the load prior to departure. Flight NCR102 taxied out normally for departure on runway 03 at Bagram at 15:14. After receiving clearance, takeoff was commenced at 15:26. The takeoff roll appeared normal. The airplane rotated normally around the Charlie intersection of the runway. Approximately 9 seconds after the crew called to rotate the airplane, the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) stopped recording, and approximately 3 seconds later the flight data recorder (FDR) stopped recording. According to witnesses and video evidence, after becoming airborne, the airplane continued to pitch up until it appeared to stall, turn to the right, then descended to impact with the ground just beyond the departure end of runway 03 and to the right.  An investigation of the wreckage revealed at least the aft-most MRAP broke loose of its restraints during takeoff, shifted aft and damaged the FDR/CVR before penetrating the aft pressure bulkhead. The MRAPÂs aft movement was determined to have compromised at least Hydraulic Systems #1 and #2 and may have contacted the stabilizer jackscrew assembly. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""National AirlinesÂ inadequate procedures for restraining special cargo loads, which resulted in the loadmasterÂs improper restraint of the cargo, which moved aft and damaged hydraulic systems Nos. 1 and 2 and horizontal stabilizer drive mechanism components, rendering the airplane uncontrollable. Contributing to the accident was the Federal Aviation AdministrationÂs inadequate oversight of National AirlinesÂ handling of special cargo loads.""METAR: 09:55 UTC / 14:25 local time: KQSA 290955Z COR 10017G30KT 9999 SCT085 BKN140 BKN200 17/06 A2992 RMK PK WND 09032/0856 LTG DSNT NW CB DSNT E SLP213 WND DATA ESTMD ALSTG/SLP ESTMD COR 1310:55 UTC / 15:25 local time: KQSA 291055Z 02007KT 9999 FEW040 BKN080CB BKN150 18/06 A2994 RMK PK WND 06026/1005 WSHFT 1027 LTG DSNT NW CB DSNT NW SLP124 WND DATA ESTMD ALSTG/SLP ESTMD10:58 UTC / 15:28 local time: KQSA 291058Z 35011G17KT 9999 FEW050 BKN080CB BKN150 14/05 A2993 RMK LTG DSNT NW SLP124 WND DATA ESTMD ALSTG/SLP ESTMD10:59 UTC / 15:29 local time: KQSA 291059Z 35011G17KT 9999 FEW050 BKN065 BKN090 14/05 A2993 RMK WND DATA ESTMD ALSTG/SLP ESTMD11:55 UTC / 16:25 local time: KQSA 291155Z 33008G17KT 9999 -TSRA SCT050CB BKN090 BKN170 13/04 A2996 RMK CB OHD MOV N SLP139 60000 70000 51014Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NTSB/AAR-15-01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Wall Street Journal  NTSB  National Airlines  SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Bagram Air Base (BPM/OAIX); 2014; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Bagram Air Base (BPM/OAIX); 2014; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; 2014; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; 2014; (publicdomain) photo (c) A1C Sarah Lipfird, USAF; Camp Bastion; 29 April 2014; (publicdomain) photo (c) Paul Nelhams; Shannon Airport (SNN/EINN); 16 August 2012; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) VÃ¡clav Kudela; Praha-Ruzyne International Airport (PRG/LKPR); 02 February 2013 photo (c) VÃ¡clav Kudela; Praha-Ruzyne International Airport (PRG/LKPR); 02 February 2013 photo (c) Jiri Starek; Praha-Ruzyne International Airport (PRG/LKPR) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Upon takeoff, a flight control system malfunction, the board found, generated directional instability, causing the aircraft's nose to slowly drift from side-to-side or ""rudder-hunt."" This condition, not fully diagnosed by the crew, progressed into a more dangerous oscillatory instability known as a ""Dutch roll."" The board identified that a poor layout of key information in the inflight manual and insufficient crew training contributed to the mishap by detracting from the crew's ability to act on critical information during their troubleshooting to turn off either of two cockpit switches which may have eliminated the malfunction. Having not recognized the Dutch roll condition, the crew initiated a left turn to remain on-course along the planned route of flight and used a small amount of left rudder to coordinate the turn. The use of rudder, while in a Dutch roll, increased the aircraft's oscillatory instability. The ensuing large side-to-side movements of the aircraft varied the crew member's foot pressure on the rudder pedal which caused inadvertent fluctuations in rudder position. These fluctuating rudder movements, coupled with slight right rudder use while rolling out of the turn, compounded the Dutch roll severity and produced extreme airframe stress that caused the KC-135's tail section to separate from the aircraft. The subsequent, uncontrollable descent resulted in an in-flight explosion.Sources: Air Mobility Command Public Affairs  Kloop.kg 3-5-2013  CNN 3-5-2013   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

During the en-route phase at cruising level, a diversion was made to circumnavigate a cloud formation with high vertical development and the descent was initiated later than planned.  The flight crew was cleared for an instrument approach, but carried out a missed approach because the runway was not in sight. Authorization was requested to change to visual flight rules, which was approved by the controller. The flight crew then initiated a visual approach by flying a short base leg, ending with a small radius turn to align with the runway. During this turn, the crew neglected to control and monitor the airspeed because the captain was looking for the runway and the first officer was reviewing the procedures according to the checklist. The aircraft stalled and lost altitude, striking a house in a residential area about 1 nautical mile from the threshold of runway 10. The accident resulted in the complete destruction of the aircraft, a house, part of two other houses, seven vehicles and a perimeter wall of the area where it fell. The probable cause was not operating the aircraft according to the procedures and parameters established by the manufacturer, in addition to the lack of situational awareness of the captain and the first officer and the failure to comply with briefings in all phases of flight operation, focused on activities that were not related to the conduct of the flight. The physical factor is considered as a contributing factor as bad weather conditions added difficulty to the flight.METAR: 13:00 UTC /  local time: METAR SVVA 051300Z 14006KT 0100 +TSSH FEW013CB OVC016 21/20 Q101614:00 UTC /  local time: METAR SVVA 051400Z 02004KT 1000 +TSRA FEW013CB OVC016 21/20 Q1017Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JIAAC Venezuela Report number: 011/2013 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: Noticias 24  El Universal   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft sustained substantial damage and the three passengers onboard were not injured. The airplane had just undergone a flight management system (FMS) upgrade at a maintenance facility in Grand Junction, and this was both its first flight, and its home base return flight, following the upgrade. The pilot reported that the flight and landing approach were uneventful. As the airplane touched down on runway 22, the pilot deployed the spoilers, and then pulled the power levers to the thrust reverser detent position; however, the deploy indicators did not illuminate. He then recycled the thrust levers back into the detent, but again the reversers did not deploy. Both the pilot and copilot attempted to troubleshoot as the airplane continued along the runway. The pilot then applied pressure to the foot pedal brakes, but did not feel a response; the copilot also attempted, but reported that the pedals felt loose and the airplane did not slow down. As the airplane approached the threshold, the pilot engaged the steering lock switch, and attempted to steer the nose wheel, but the airplane did not respond. Just prior to reaching the runway end, he activated the emergency braking lever; however, the airplane rolled off the runway end, through a set of instrument landing system antennas, and down an embankment. Subsequent examination revealed that the mounting screws for both the left and right main landing gear squat switches were loose, such that the switches had backed away from their mounting pads. The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: Failure of maintenance personnel to reattach the landing gear squat switches following maintenance, which rendered the airplane's steering, braking, and thrust reverser systems inoperative during landing. Contributing to the accident were the failure of both the maintenance facility mechanics and the airplane operator's mechanic and flight crew to identify the error during post maintenance checks, a failure of the airplane's pilot to apply the emergency brakes in a timely manner, and the copilot's decision to attempt to engage the thrust reversers as the airplane approached the runway end despite multiple indications that they were inoperative and producing partial forward, rather than reverse, thrust.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: WPR13FA227 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; McMinnville Municipal Airport, OR; May 2013; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; McMinnville Municipal Airport, OR; May 2013; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Two crew members and one passenger sustained serious injuries. The airplane departed Pokhara Airport (PKR) at 08:10 on a domestic flight to Jomsom. While descending towards the destination airport, the Jomsom controller reported that there was a south-westerly 8-12 knot wind with runway 24 in use. During the approach the pilot in command took over the communication function of the copilot and contacted Jomsom Tower, requesting to use runway 06 instead of runway 24, despite the advice of the tower controller to use runway 24 to avoid tail wind effect in runway 06.  The tailwind component, exceeded the five knot tailwind limit stipulated in the companyÂs standard operating procedure. The airplane touched down 776 feet past the threshold of the 2,424-foot-long runway 06. It covered a distance of 194 feet on the airstrip and veered towards the grassland.  During the landing roll, when the aircraft was decelerating, the co-pilot had raised the flaps as per the existing practice of carrying out the after the landing checks."" The pilot in command added power to re-enter the runway. After running 705 feet on the grassland the airplane entered the runway again. Without making his intentions clear to the copilot, the pilot in command continued adding power for go around.  The accelerating aircraft gained insufficient speed and lift to take off and ran out of the runway 24 end, continued towards the river, hit the barbed fence and gabion wall with an initial impact and finally fell down onto the banks of Kaligandaki River. The most probable cause of the accident is the inappropriate conduct of STOL procedure and landing technique carried out by the PIC, during the landing-phase and an endeavour to carry out take off again with no sufficient airspeed, no required lifting force and non availability of required runway length to roll. Contributory factors to the occurrence is the absence of proper CRM in terms of communication, coordination and briefing in between crew members on intention and action being taken by PIC during pre and post landing phase.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Nepal AAIC Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: eKantipur  Hemant Arjyal  The Himalayan Times History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  16 October 2011 9N-ABO Nepal Airlines, opf Tara Air 0 Lukla Airport - VNLK min Taxiway excursion Location  Images: photo (c) pm subedi; Jomsom Airport (JMO/VNJS); 16 May 2013 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The four occupants of the aircraft were uninjured in the accident.  The approach to Campo de Marte was flown at VRef +10 kt, a little higher than recommended by the manufacturer. Also, the airplane was near its maximum landing weight.  The aircraft touched down on runway 12 at a position approximately 1000 m from the runway threshold. Some 900 m were necessary for landing, but the remaining runway distance was about 300 m. The inexperienced pilot (10 hours on type) attempted to use the emergency braking system, but pulled the wrong handle. He accidently raised the undercarriage. The airplane slid off the left side of the runway and came to rest in the grass. Contributing factors (translated from Portuguese): Concerning the operation of the aircraft  a) Application of commands - contributed  The final approach at a speed higher than anticipated, the touchdown at 1,000 meters from the runway threshold and the braking action without using the pedals show the inadequate use of controls of the aircraft.  b) Cockpit coordination - unspecified  There may not have been a proper cockpit coordination between the commander and his copilot. The distribution of tasks, accurate communication and consultation with the manufacturer's manuals could have prevented the accident.  c) Education - unspecified  It is possible that the captain did not receive adequate training in the operation of the aircraft, but it was not possible to prove the fact that the commander did not receive instruction.  d) Piloting judgement - contributed  There was no adequate judgement of the crew when it was decided to conduct an approach at a speed higher than recommended by the manufacturer and the touch down beyond the first third runway available.  e) Planning of flight - contributed  The weight of the aircraft to near maximum landing weight demanded increasing distance required for landing.  f) Low pilot experience - unspecified  Limited experience of the pilot in jet aircraft may have contributed to the occurrence. A better understanding into the aerodynamics, using graphics charts to calculate speeds and distances required for landing and simulator training could have been barriers to prevent this accident.  g) Management Oversight - unspecified  The lack of records of hours flown and inspections for a long period of time, demonstrate inadequate supervision of the responsible operation.  However, it was not proven that there was some sort of mechanical failure that could impair the braking system of the aircraft.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CENIPA Report number: A-097/CENIPA/2013 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) RenÃ© Ballo; Assis Airport, SP (AIF/SBAS); 1998 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were no injuries. The C-130, assigned to the 41st Airlift Squadron, 19th Airlift Wing, was conducting a medical evacuation when the accident occurred. The accident happened on the third of five planned legs that day to an airfield that was at 6,809 feet Mean Sea Level (MSL) and experiencing winds varying from 200 to 250 degrees gusting from 6 to 28 knots. On the second attempted landing, the aircraft touched down approximately 1,500 ft down the runway but was 27 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS) faster than computed touchdown landing speed leading to the aircraft going off the end of the runway at approximately 49 KIAS. It struck a ditch which collapsed the nose gear and eventually ripped the right main landing gear from the fuselage. The right outboard engine struck the ground, pressurized fuel and oil lines were broken, fluid was sprayed over the cracked engine casing, and the right wing caught fire. The aircraft came to a full stop at approximately 544 feet off the end of the paved runway surface. The Accident Investigation Board (AIB) president found, by clear and convincing evidence, that the causes of the accident were poor Crew Resource Management (CRM) and mishap pilot one's (MP1) late power reduction causing a 27 KIAS fast touchdown at a high altitude airfield (6,809 ft MSL). Additionally, the AIB President found by the preponderance of evidence that each of the following factors substantially contributed to the mishap: 1) Channelized Attention; 2) Risk Assessment; 3) Delayed Necessary Action; 4) Response Set; 5) Procedural Error.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: USAF AIB Report number: Executive summary report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Stars and Stripes 20-5-2013  Damn, this Afghan Airstrip Practically Eats American Planes (Medium.com 12-6-2013)   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

British Airways flight BA762 departed runway 27L on a scheduled service to Oslo, Norway. At that moment, the fan cowl doors from both engines detached, puncturing a fuel pipe on the right engine and damaging the airframe. The symptoms seen by the flight crew included: engine thrust control degradation, the loss of the yellow hydraulic system, and a significant fuel leak. After the loss of the yellow hydraulic system the crew declared a PAN, with the intention of returning to Heathrow once they had fully assessed the situation. ATC provided radar vectors for the ILS to runway 27R. During the approach to land, an external fire developed on the right engine. An engine fire warning on the flight deck prompted the crew to declare a MAYDAY.  Although both engine fire extinguisher bottles were discharged and the right engine was shut down, the fire was not completely extinguished. The left engine continued to perform normally throughout the flight. The aircraft landed safely and was brought to a stop on runway 27R at Heathrow. The airport fire service attended and quickly extinguished a small fire on the right engine. The passengers and crew evacuated via the escape slides on the left side of the aircraft, without injury. Causal factors The investigation identified the following causal factors: 1. The technicians responsible for servicing the aircraftÂs IDGs did not comply with the applicable AMM procedures, with the result that the fan cowl doors were left in an unlatched and unsafe condition following overnight maintenance. 2. The  pre-departure  walk-around  inspections  by  both  the pushback tug driver and the co-pilot did not identify that the fan cowl doors on both engines were unlatched. Contributory factors The investigation identified the following contributory factors: 1. The design of the fan cowl door latching system, in which the latches are positioned at the bottom of the engine nacelle in close proximity to the ground, increased the probability that  unfastened  latches  would  not  be  seen  during  the pre-departure inspections. 2. The lack of the majority of the high-visibility paint finish on the latch handles reduced the conspicuity of the unfastened latches. 3. The decision by the technicians to engage the latch handle hooks  prevented  the  latch  handles  from  hanging  down beneath the fan cowl doors as intended, further reducing the conspicuity of the unfastened latches.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: AAIB AAR 1/2015 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) AAIB; London-Heathrow Airport (LHR/EGLL); May 2013 photo (c) AAIB; London-Heathrow Airport (LHR/EGLL); 24 May 2013 photo (c) AAIB; London-Heathrow Airport (LHR/EGLL); 24 May 2013 photo (c) Willem GÃ¶ebel; Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS/EHAM) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight descended to FL160 and meanwhile RAF Typhoon jets were scrambled to escort the plane to London-Stansted where it landed safely on runway 23 at 13:10 UTC. Initial information suggests that two male passengers had repeatedly tried to get into the cockpit and started making threats. Both men were arrested after landing. A trial was started in November 2013. The prosecutor stated that both men made ""threats to kill members of the cabin crew, threats to kill passengers and threats to blow up the plane whilst it was in flight."" The situation ensued when cabin crew made an announcement asking for a medical professional to assist an elderly passenger who had fallen ill.

Marie Airport, ON (YAM), Canada. There were no reported injuries. Porter Airlines flight 689 was on a visual short final approach to Sault Ste. Marie's Airport runway 30 when power was reduced to correct the descent profile. The aircraft's descent rate quickly increased and was not arrested with power application. The airspeed decreased, causing the approach to become unstabilized. The aircraft landed hard and during the landing flair the pitch angle increased such that the tail of the aircraft contacted the runway surface. There was significant damage to the aircraft skin and structure where it contacted the ground. The aircraft taxied to the gate without further incident. Findings as to causes and contributing factors: 1. Neither crew member identified that the airspeed had dropped below landing reference speed; the flight no longer met the requirements of a stabilized approach, and an overshoot was required. 2. The pilot monitoring did not identify the decreasing airspeed and increasing descent rate in time to notify the pilot flying or intervene. 3. In response to the pilot monitoring's warning to add power, the pilot flying pitched the nose up beyond the limits stated in the standard operating procedures and the manufacturer's pitch awareness training. 4. The high rate of descent coupled with the high nose-up attitude of the aircraft resulted in the hard landing that compressed the struts and allowed the tail to strike the runway. Findings as to risk 1. If standard operating procedures do not clearly define the requirements for a stabilized visual approach, there is an increased risk that continued flight could result in a landing accident. 2. If standard operating procedures do not clearly define the duties of the pilot monitoring, there is an increased risk that unsafe flight conditions could develop.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A13O0098 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: CADORS 2013O1292   Location  Images: photo (c) TSB; Sault Ste.

The airplane, operated by Deraya Air Taxi, departed Jayapura-Sentani Airport (DJJ) on a domestic cargo flight to Wamena Airport (WMX).  The captain acted as Pilot Flying and the first officer acted as Pilot Monitoring (PM). At 06:27 the aircraft departed from Sentani Airport and climbed to the cruising altitude of 12,000 feet.  The first officer contacted the Wamena Tower controller at 07:01, while the aircraft was approaching Pass Valley point. The controller informed that runway 15 was in use and the weather condition was wind calm, visibility 4 km, low cloud on finals and QNH 1008 mbs.  At 07:07, the first officer reported they were on final to runway 15. When reporting runway in sight two minutes later, the controller provided the clearance to land. On short final the aircraft was on heading 140Â° and was on the right side of the correct flight path. The pilot then rolled to the left up to 20Â° to align with the runway, then rolled to the right to align with runway 15. This correction was conducted at altitude between 400 to 200 feet AGL. The aircraft touched down on the centerline. During the landing roll at about 750 meters from the beginning of runway 15 the aircraft veered to the left of the runway shoulder, the pilot recovered by applying the right rudder and asymmetrical reverse thrust but the aircraft continued veer to the left and stopped at about 10 meters on the left shoulder of the runway 15. The nose landing gear detached and was found on the shoulder at about 250 meter from the aircraft's final position. The main landing gears were broken and all the propellers bent. Contributing Factors: The flight did not meet the criteria according to the recommended elements of stabilized approach which required go around. The aircraft touched down with 2Â° misalignment with the runway direction then the aircraft veered off to the left. The recovery action was not in accordance to the correct technique according to the ALAR Tool Kit.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSC Report number: KNKT.13.05.18.04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) NTSC; Wamena Airport (WMX); 31 May 2013 photo (c) NTSC; Wamena Airport (WMX); 31 May 2013 photo (c) NTSC; Wamena Airport (WMX); 31 May 2013 photo (c) NTSC; Wamena Airport (WMX); 31 May 2013 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Cebu Pacific Air flight 5J-971 was a domestic service from Manila (MNL) to Davao City.  The aircraft touched down on runway 23 at a point about 30 m before the marked touchdown point (TP) about 190 m from the threshold. The airplane came down on the right-half portion very near the right edge lights. The aircraft continued to the right edge of the runway until the right hand main landing gear fell-off the cemented runway at about 129 m from the touchdown point, followed by the nosegear and the left hand main gear about 511 m from TP. With all landing gears on the soft ground the aircraft rolled for about 330 m more with an indication of trying to return to runway and it momentarily crossed over the concrete entrance taxiway of the parking ramp before it made a full-stop on a grassy area ahead and near the runway, about 845 m from TP.  The passengers deplaned via the forward left-hand evacuation slide, which was deployed about fifteen minutes after landing. PROBABLE CAUSE  The Aircraft Accident Investigation and Inquiry Board determined that the probable causes of this accident are the following:  - PilotsÂ lack of event proficiency in low-visibility non-precision approach and landing at night. Human Factor. Pilot Error. Psychological (Psychomotor skill, recent experience). The PIC as pilot flying Pilot Flying (PF) failed to maintain a stabilized landing approach (under precipitation) until below the MDA so that moments before the touchdown (precipitation becoming heavy), the aircraft was still at left of runway centerline with the FO calling (to align) RIGHT which was done by PF but having lost grasp of the centerline, the correction exceeded the centerline with FO calling ( to correct toward the unlighted center ) LEFT but the aircraft already touched down aligned to the right edge lights that was misconstrued by the PF as the center lights ( based on the repeated expressions of the PF during the landing roll until the aircraft has fully stopped ).  - The emergency procedure for go-around was necessary but not utilized. Human Factor. Pilot Error. Psychological (Learning, Emotion/ Mental Narrowed Attention) The pilot probably was experiencing Narrowed Attention due to apprehension by being acutely conscious of the difficulty ahead ( bad weather ). Added to this was his proficiency status ( one flight to Davao in last 3 months ) and at confusion to notice things in the periphery of his attention i.e., to execute a go-around and make another approach well-prepared on the techniques with lower precipitation level. Contributory Factors:  - Adverse weather condition. Environmental factor. Natural Environment  The weather condition severely affected the judgment and decision-making of the PIC even prior to the approach to land. Heavy rainfall obscured the horizontal visibility of the pilots preventing a clear view of the runway.  - Absence of runway center lights. Environmental factor. Man-made Environment (Aerodrome) The PIC misconstrued the edge lights as the runway center lights. Low-visibility approaches require that these lights be present to help guide the pilots toward the runway center.  - Inadequate CRM procedures. Human factor. Psychological. (Training)  Standard and non-standard call-outs and responses are the hallmarks of an effective cockpit/CRM environment. There were lapses, omissions and contradictory words employed during the landing approach.  - Inadequate pilot re-currency training methods. Human Factor. Psychological. (Training)  Missed approach procedures during low-visibility non-precision approaches were seldom practiced during the re-currency training of the pilots. The over-use of baseline airports with runway center lights deprived the pilots the opportunity to hone their instrument flying skills in basic airports where they usually operate that has no center lights. - Lack of policy on the advisory role of air traffic controllers ( ATC ). Human Factor. Psychological. (Training)  During adverse weather conditions the ATC has no participation in the safety decisions which would require runway closure during critical aerodrome conditions especially in environmental conditions below runway visual minimaMETAR: 10:00 UTC / 18:00 local time: METAR RPMD 021000Z 14002 9999 TS BKN015 CB SCT090 BKN290 29/26 Q1008 CB SW-SE AND OVHD DIST PCPN NW LITS NWinds: 140 degrees at 2 knots; Visibility: 6 or more miles (10+ km); Ceiling: 1500 feet AGL; Clouds: broken clouds at 1500 feet AGL, scattered clouds at 9000 feet AGL, broken clouds at 29000 feet AGL; Thunderstorm; Temperature: 29Â°C; Dewpoint: 26Â°C; Pressure: 1008.0 mb.

The pilot was killed. The pilot had sold his previous Beechcraft B200 King Air on the day of the accident and he had bought a B200GT, which had a different avionics suite than he was used to. He flew from Georgetown, Texas to Baton Rouge, Louisiana and dropped off two passengers there. The pilot elected to continue to McComb. The airplane departed runway 31 at Baton Rouge. Just after takeoff, the controller assigned the pilot a heading and altitude to McComb (MCB). The airplane turned northeast, on course, and reached an altitude of 1,200 feet. The radar track data then showed the airplane in a slow descent and slowing down; the airplane then disappeared from radar, prior to the accident site. The last radio transmission from the pilot was that he was going to crash. The airplane came down in a residential area at Rue Jennifer in the Baker suburb of Baton Rouge.

There were 165 passengers and five crew members on board. Three occupants were injured. Flight W6-3141 departed Bucharest-Henri Coanda International Airport (OTP) about 06:45 hours local time (03:45 UTC) on an international passenger flight to Roma-Ciampino Airport (CIA). The flight was approaching Ciampino Airport's runway 15 about 07:20 local time (05:20 UTC) when the crew encountered problems getting the undercarriage down and locked. A Master Warning occurred and a message was shown on the Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitoring (ECAM) display, which indicated ""L/G GEAR NOT DOWNLOCKED"". The crew flew a missed approach procedure and headed to an area north of Rome were it entered a holding pattern at an altitude of 5000 feet. The crew carried out a recycle and performed a gravity extension as well as some g-force manoeuvres, but the left hand main landing gear remained stuck. The crew decided to divert to Rome-Fiumicino.  Approaching Rome-Fiumicino Airport runway 34R at 07:58 (05:58 UTC), the aircraft was instructed by the Tower controller to go-around due to some incoherency in the information provided by the crew about the current position of the landing gear. A new approach to runway 34R was performed and the aircraft touched down on the runway at 08:06 (06:06 UTC) with the left main gear only partially extended. The flightcrew shutoff the left engine just before touchdown and the right one a few seconds later. The aircraft came to rest after scraping the left engine on the runway for about 1200 m. An emergency evacuation was carried out.Sources: ANSV History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  28 September 2021 HA-LWM Wizz Air 0 Iași International Airport (IAS/LRIA) non 25 August 2024 HA-LWM Wizz Air Malta 0 S of Budapest non Fumes/smoke/odor event Location  Images: photo (c) Miklos SZABO; Budapest-Ferihegy Airport (BUD/LHBP); 19 March 2012 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were no injuries among the 30 passengers and three crew members. SOL LÃ­neas AÃ©reas flight 5420 was taxiing for takeoff at Mendoza-El Plumerillo Airport when the crew lost directional control of the aircraft. The airplane exited the taxiway and came to rest on rough terrain. Propeller blades of engine no. 1 were damaged, with shrapnel causing a 5 cm long hole in the fuselage. Aviation sources in Argentina reported in March 2013 that the airplane was considered damaged beyond economical repair. Conclusions: (translated from Spanish) While taxiing to the holding point of the runway in use, the crew of flight 8R5420 lost directional control and departed the taxiway, which resulted in the impact of the aircraft with objects on the ground. This was due to a combination of the following factors: - The electric pump which controls fluid pressure in the hydraulic system was not operational, generating a deficit of fluid pressure in the hydraulic system. - The low fluid pressure warning in the hydraulic system was not recognized by the crew. - The crew could not control the path of the aircraft due to the unavailability of nose wheel steering. - The persistence of an informal practice among the crews of the operator on the operation of the hydraulic system, contrary to the concept of operation of the hydraulic system established by the manufacturer. - The lack of detection of the informal practice on the operation of the hydraulic system by the operator's safety monitoring mechanisms.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JIAAC Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: JIAAC  Susto en Mendoza: se despistÃ³ un aviÃ³n de Sol (Perfil.com, 2-1-2013)   Location  Images: photo (c) Gustavo Lepez; Mendoza-El Plumerillo Airport, MD (MDZ/SAME); February 2013 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Some seven minutes after takeoff, the pilot radioed that they were 10 NM from the Gran Roque VOR, at an altitude of 5000 feet. The controller instructed the flight to contact Maiquetia Approach, but no contact was established. Radar data showed that the flight continued to climb, reaching 5400 feet at a distance of 13.3 NM from the Gran Roque VOR. Speed was 120 knots. At that point the airplane rapidly started to lose altitude and speed. A piece of luggage that was carried aboard the plane was found late January on the coast of the island of CuraÃ§ao. On February 12, two bags belonging to the occupants of the missing plane were found washed ashore at the island of Bonaire. On June 27, the wreckage was located by a search party.

Flight DV760 operated on a domestic flight from Kokshetau Airport (KOV) to Almaty (ALA). Weather forecast obtained by the crew before departure showed a visibility of 800 m at Almaty with a vertical visibility of 90 m, and temporary reduced visibility to 200 meters. The flight took off at 11:19 hours local time. The captain was Pilot Flying. At 12:00 the flight contacted Almaty Control and received the current weather conditions which showed a limited visibility for runway 23R of 200 m. At 12:40 the flight was cleared to descend to FL80. By then visibility had decreased to 175 m. The captain decided to continue descent and prepare for an approach to decision height. The captain became increasingly stressed by the poor weather conditions. After reaching FL80 the crew were told to remain at that altitude because of another flight in the area. This provoked a strong emotional reaction from the captain. At 12:57 the flight was then cleared down to 1600 m. During the descent the lack of improvement of weather conditions caused a greater and greater irritation on the part of the captain. When turning to finals the runway visual range (RVR) for the first, mid and last part of runway 23R was reported as 275-250-225 m in freezing fog with a vertical visibility of 40 meters. With continuing visibility updates the flight crew kept descending until it was clear that a landing was impossible given the lack of visual contact with the ground. A missed approach was initiated at 13:10 from a height of 180 m. The autopilot was disconnected and the TO/GA button was pushed. Engine power increased and the flaps were raised to 8Â°. In the four seconds after pressing to TO/GA button there were no control inputs. Then the captain pushed the control column forward, causing the aircraft to descend. The EGPWS warning sounded as the pitch changed to -9. The observer pilot tried to draw attention on the EGPWS warning but there was no response on the controls by the flight crew. Pitch angle further increased to -16Â° and vertical speed was -20 to -30 m/sec. The aircraft impacted the ground at high speed and a -20Â° pitch angle and broke up. CONCLUSION: (translated from Russian): The accident with aircraft CRJ-200 UP-CJ006 occurred during the execution of a go-around, in instrument meteorological conditions, without the possibility of visual contact with ground reference points (vertical visibility in the fog did not exceed 40 m), the necessity of which was caused by the mismatch between the actual weather conditions and the minimum conditions for which the crew was certified to land. As a result, the deflection of the elevator towards a dive of the aircraft caused a descent and collision with the ground. It was not possible to uniquely identify the causes of the aircraft's transfer to a dive from the available data. The Commission did not find evidence of failures of aviation equipment, as well as external to the aircraft (icing, wind shear, wake turbulence) when trying to perform a go-around.  The most likely factors that led to the accident, were:   - partial loss performance of the pilot in command, which at the time of aircraft impact with the ground was not in a working position;   - the lack of CRM levels in the crew, and violation of the Fly-Navigate-Communicate principle, which manifested itself in diverting attention by the co-pilot to conduct external radio communication and lack of control of the flight instrument parameters;   - the lack of response to the EGPWS and the actions required;   - the impact somatographic illusions of perception of the pitch angle (a nose-up illusion);   - increased emotional stress by the crew members associated with the unjustified expectations of improved weather conditions at the time of landing;   - failure to comply with the requirements for health examination of flight personnel, which led to the pilot in command flying without the rehabilitation period and without assessment of his health status after undergoing surgery.METAR: 07:00 UTC / 13:00 local time: UAAA 290700Z 05001MPS 0150 R23R/0150N R23L/0200N FZFG VV001 M01/M01 Q1019 882/0150 NOSIG RMK QBB040Wind 050 degrees at 1 m/sec (2 knots); Visibility: 150 m; Runway Visual Range of runway 23R: 150 m, and 200 m at runway 23L; Freezing fog; Temperature: -1Â°C; Dewpoint: -1Â°C; Pressure: 1019 mb.07:30 UTC / 13:30 local time: UAAA 290730Z 02001MPS 0150 R23R/0150N R23L/0200N FZFG VV001 M01/M01 Q1018 882/0150 NOSIG RMK QBB040Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: Interfax  Prosecutor General's office of Republic of Kazakhstan  Ministry of Transport   Location  Images: photo (c) MAK; Almaty Airport (ALA); January 2013 photo (c) MAK; Almaty Airport (ALA); January 2013 photo (c) MAK; Almaty Airport (ALA); January 2013 photo (c) MAK; Almaty Airport (ALA); January 2013 photo (c) MAK; Almaty Airport (ALA); January 2013 photo (c) MAK; Almaty Airport (ALA); January 2013 photo (c) MAK; Almaty Airport (ALA); January 2013 photo (c) MAK; Almaty Airport (ALA); January 2013 photo (c) MAK; Almaty Airport (ALA); January 2013 photo (c) MAK; Almaty Airport (ALA); January 2013 photo (c) MAK; Almaty Airport (ALA); January 2013 photo (c) MAK; Almaty Airport (ALA); January 2013 photo (c) Alexander Zaleski; Almaty Airport (ALA); 07 January 2013; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) Vaclav Kudela; Praha-Ruzyne International Airport (PRG/LKPR); 30 January 2010 photo (c) Harro Ranter / ASN; Helsinki-Vantaa Airport (HEL/EFHK); 10 September 2001 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates02-Jan-2025 09:03 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Of the 50 occupants, five sustained serious injuries. Alitalia flight 1670 had departed Pisa-Galileo Galilei Airport (PSA) on a domestic flight to Roma-Fiumicino Airport (FCO). This flight was operated by Carpatair on behalf of Alitalia.  The airplane flew the approach in strong cross wind conditions with wind shear reported at runway 16L some fifteen minutes before the landing. Shortly before touchdown the airplane suddenly lost altitude and impacted the runway with the nose landing gear. This was at a distance of 567 meters from the runway threshold. It bounced three times, causing the nose and main gear to collapse. The airplane slid off the left side of the runway and came to rest in the grass near taxiway DE, at a distance of about 1780 meters from the runway threshold. The aircraft had also performed a rotation on the vertical axis of 170Â°, thus assuming a definitive orientation of about 330Â° magnetic. It came to rest 400 m from fire station no. 1. However, it took the fire services ten minutes to reach the airplane because they were not aware of the precise location of the accident. The airplane landed in strong winds from 250 degrees on runway 16L. Runway 25 at Fiumicino was Notamed not available for landings due to work in progress. The Fiumicino Notam reported at the time of the accident of the following limitations of the runway 16L ILS: - LOCALIZER AT 17NM MRA 3000FT AND AT 25NM MRA 4000FT - GLIDE PATH COVERAGE REDUCED AT 8.5NM The ATR 72-212 has a demonstrated maximum crosswind component of 35 kts on a dry runway. CAUSES: (translated from Italian) The accident is due to the human factor. In particular, it was caused by an improper conduct of the aircraft by the PF (commander) during landing, not consistent with the provisions of the operator's manuals, in an environmental context characterized by the presence of significant criticality (presence of crosswind with values at the limit/excess those allowed for the ATR 72) and in the absence of an effective CRM. The following factors may have contributed to the event. - The failure to carry out the landing briefing, which, in addition to being required by company regulations, would have been an important moment of pooling and acceptance of information fundamental to the safety of operations. - The maintenance of a V APP significantly higher than expected. - The conviction of the commander (PF), deriving from his considerable general and specific experience on the aircraft in question, to be able to conduct a safe landing in spite of the presence of critical wind conditions for the type of aircraft. - The considerable difference in experience between the commander and the first officer, which has reasonably prevented the latter from showing his critical capacity, thus rendering CRM techniques ineffective. After the accident, the application of the PEA revealed some critical issues, which did not allow to carry out in a timely and effective manner the search and rescue of the aircraft and its occupants.METAR: 19:20 UTC / 20:20 local time: LIRF 021920Z 25028G41KT 9999 SCT023 SCT040 11/04 Q0992 WS RWY 16L NOSIGWind 250 degrees at 28 knots, gusting to 41 knots; Visibility: 10+ km; Scattered clouds at 2200 feet AGL and 4000 feet AGL; Temperature: 11Â°C; Dewpoint: 4Â°C; Pressure: 992 mb; Windshear at runway 16L19:50 UTC / 20:50 local time: LIRF 021950Z 25023KT 9999 SCT023 SCT040 11/03 Q0992 NOSIG20:20 UTC / 21:20 local time: LIRF 022020Z 25022G32KT 9999 SCT022 BKN040 11/03 Q0992 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: ANSV Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Repubblica  BEA   Location  Images: photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Nassau International Airport (NAS/MYNN); 04 April 2002 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane operated on a charter flight from Odessa (ODS) to Donetsk (DOK), carrying football fans on their way to a match of Shakhtar Donetsk against Borussia Dortmund. When commencing their descent towards Donetsk, the crew received the latest weather observations, which showed limited visibility due to fog. The captain of the flight was certified to carry out approaches to a decision height of 300 m. After reaching decision height the crew did not observe the approach lights of runway 08. The captain continued the approach, descending below 300 m. He did not inform the other flight crew members of his intentions. The co-pilot and flight engineer did not take action to support the speed of the aircraft managing the engine's power settings. The captain then attempted to climb, causing the airspeed to drop to 150 km/h. The airplane stalled and fell off to the right. The airplane impacted the ground at a 48Â° bank angle. The commission investigating the crash concluded that the cause of this accident was a loss of speed by the aircraft during approach due to an error of an unprepared crew, which had not been allowed to make the flight in those weather conditions.METAR: 16:00 UTC / 18:00 local time: UKCC 131600Z 07002MPS 030V090 0250 R08/0750N FG VV001 01/01 Q1026 08290055 BECMG 0200 FG VV001Wind 2m/sec at 070 degrees, varying from 30 to 90 degrees; Visibility: 250 m (820 ft); Runway visual range at runway 08: 750 m (2460 ft); Fog; indefinite ceiling with vertical visibility of 100 feet AGL; Temperature: 1Â°C; Dew point: 1Â°C; Pressure : 1026 mb; Visibility becoming 200 m in fog with a vertical visibility of 100 feet AGL16:30 UTC / 18:30 local time: UKCC 131630Z 00000MPS 0500 R08/1300VP2000D PRFG VV002 01/01 Q1026 08290055 BECMG 0200 FG VV00117:00 UTC / 19:00 local time: UKCC 131700Z 00000MPS 0250 R08/0750N PRFG VV002 01/01 Q1026 08290055 BECMG 0200 FG VV001Visibility: 250 m (820 ft); Runway visual range at runway 08: 750 m (2460 ft); Partial fog; indefinite ceiling with vertical visibility of 200 feet AGL; Temperature: 1Â°C; Dew point: 1Â°C; Pressure : 1026 mb; Visibility becoming 200 m in fog with a vertical visibility of 100 feet AGL.17:30 UTC / 19:30 local time: UKCC 131730Z 00000MPS 0800 R08/0750V1800D PRFG VV001 01/01 Q1026 08290055 BECMG 0200 FG VV001Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NBAAI Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: RIA Novosti  URA-Inform  Interfax-Ukraine (10-4-2013)   Location  Images: photo (c) State Service of Emergency Ukraine; Donetsk Airport (DOK/UKCC); 13 February 2013 photo (c) State Service of Emergency Ukraine; Donetsk Airport (DOK/UKCC); 13 February 2013 photo (c) State Service of Emergency Ukraine; Donetsk Airport (DOK/UKCC); 13 February 2013 photo (c) State Service of Emergency Ukraine; Donetsk Airport (DOK/UKCC); 13 February 2013 photo (c) Volodymyr Moroz; Lvov-Snilow Airport (LWO/UKLL); 01 January 2013 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The copilot was Pilot Flying, the Pilot in Command (PIC) was Pilot Monitoring.  While en route at FL390 the flight crew listened out the ATIS frequency for Berlin-SchÃ¶nefeld, but they failed to hear any airport information. After commencing the descent, the flight was cleared for an ILS approach to runway 07L at Berlin-SchÃ¶nefeld. When passing FL200 in the descent, the Pilot Flying wanted to start the descent checklist, but the Pilot Monitoring wanted to fully listen out the ATIS which was now being received. The ATIS among others stated: ""[...] moderate icing reported below 3 000 feet [...]"". At 08:51 the Pilot Monitoring stated that the temperature was not below zero Celsius and that he wanted to wait before switching on the anti-ice systems. Four minutes later he switched on the Engine Anti-Ice System as temperature had dropped below zero. At 08:57 the flight was cleared to land on runway 07L. When working the Approach checklist, the Pilot Monitoring at the ""icing conditions"" item stated that ""it is still on"". The aircraft was subsequently configured for the final approach and the autopilot was disconnected. The PIC stated that they had visual contact with the runway and that 'everything could be switched off'. He proceeded to switch off the Engine Anti-Ice and Windshield Anti-Ice Systems. As the aircraft was flared over the threshold, the left wing dropped and contacted the runway. The aircraft then rolled right and touched down hard on the right hand main landing gear. The gear leg broke and the aircraft slid along the side of the runway until coming to a stop 447 meters past the runway threshold. A few minutes after the accident, officials noted that a 10 mm layer of ice had accumulated on the aircraft nose, wing leading edge, undercarriage and stabilizer. The PIC stated after the accident that he had not seen any ice accretion on the outer third of the wing and decided not to use the Wing and Horizontal Stabilizer De-Ice System. Activating this system would also have reduced aircraft performance. Causes (translated from German): The aircraft accident is attributable to the following causes: - The crew performed the approach under known icing conditions and did not switch on the Wing and Horizontal Stabilizer De-Ice System, contrary to the standard operating procedures (SOP). - During the flare the aircraft entered a stall due to ice build-up on the wings and tail unit and the fact that the speed fell below the approach speed prescribed for icing conditions, and fell off to the side. Contributing factor: - The crew had insufficient knowledge regarding the relationship between the Ice Protection System and the Stall Warning Protection System (SWPS).Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BFU Report number: BFU CX001-13 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 years and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: BFU CX001-13   Location  Images: photo (c) Jonathan Palombo; 12 March 2012; (CC:by) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

A flight attendant, who was on her rest break and was resting in the bunk room, reported that the turbulence had stopped for a while and that she thought she heard a ""faint ding"" indicating that the seatbelt sign had been turned off, so she went to the lavatory. However, the flight then encountered moderate turbulence, during which the flight attendant sustained a serious injury while walking from her bunk to the lavatory. The flight attendant reported that announcements made over the public address system could not be heard in the bunk room and that it was not always possible to hear when the seatbelt sign was turned on or off.

The captain and the co-pilot survived. The remaining five occupants were killed. The airplane departed Nashville-John C. Tune Airport, TN about 18:27 CST on a flight to Thomson-McDuffie County Airport, GA.  According to the cockpit voice recorder (CVR), after the landing gear was lowered, about 20:04, the copilot noted that the ""ANTI SKID FAIL"" annunciator light illuminated. The pilot continued the approach, and, about 20:05, the airplane touched down on runway 10. The takeoff warning horn sounded about 0.3 seconds before the pilot stated that he was performing a go-around. The airplane lifted off near the departure end of the runway. The copilot directed the pilot to increase pitch. According to EGPWS data, as the airplane climbed to an altitude of about 63 ft (19 m) above the ground, about 9 seconds after liftoff, the left wing struck a utility pole located about 0.25 miles (400 m) east of the departure end of the runway. The airplane continued about 925 ft (282 m) before colliding with trees and terrain. It was destroyed by impact forces and a postcrash fire. Runway 10 is a 5503 ft (1677 m) long asphalt runway. The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: ""The pilot's failure to follow airplane flight manual procedures for an antiskid failure in flight and his failure to immediately retract the lift dump after he elected to attempt a go-around on the runway. Contributing to the accident were the pilot's lack of systems knowledge and his fatigue due to acute sleep loss and his ineffective use of time between flights to obtain sleep.""METAR: 01:35 UTC / 20:35 local time: KHQU 210135Z AUTO 26003KT 10SM 06/M03 A3012 RMK AO1 T00611026Wind 260 degrees at 3 knots; Visibility: 10 or more miles; Temperature: 6Â°C; Dewpoint: -3Â°C; Pressure: 1020 mb.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA13MA139 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  Augusta Chronicle   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Thomson-McDuffie County Airport, GA; February 2013; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Thomson-McDuffie County Airport, GA; February 2013; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Thomson-McDuffie County Airport, GA; February 2013; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Thomson-McDuffie County Airport, GA; February 2013; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were 8 crew members and 117 passengers on board. The copilot was Pilot Flying.  After an uneventful flight of approximately two hours, the aircraft was established on ILS, for landing on runway 30 at Ponta Delgada Airport. Final approach was performed with both autopilots engaged in LAND mode and Auto Throttle engaged with SPEED mode selected. The aircraft was stabilized on glide slope and localizer, with an approach airspeed Vapp of 132 kts, for a Vref of 126 kts. Descending through 286ft (Radio Altimeter) the autopilots were disengaged. The aircraft was thereafter flown manually, assisted by the use of flight directors and autothrottle. Below 20 feet at a slightly high descent rate there was a short flare followed by a light bounce with spoilers extended. The ensuing aircraft's natural aerodynamic tendency was an increase in the pitch attitude in conjunction with a pulling force exerted on the control column with a high pitch rate (3Â°/s) and increasing high pitch up attitude (up to 14.82Â°). This manoeuvre, most likely to avoid a hard nose wheel ground contact, made the tail strike the ground. By the time the main landing gear shock absorbers were fully compressed the aircraftÂs pitch angle had exceeded the ground/ tail clearance of 13.2Â°. The aircraft was taxied to the apron and a maintenance preliminary check was performed. The aircraft had sustained serious damage to the underside of the rear fuselage, where the lower skin panels were abraded by contact with the runway surface. In some areas, the skin was buckled through its full thickness and some vertical struts bent the attachment area in the airframe structure. CAUSES OF THE ACCIDENT PRIMARY CAUSE Inadequate recovery handling of a bounced firm landing (deviation from recommended flying pilot technique). CONTRIBUTING FACTORS The following were considered as contributing factors: a) High sink rate prior to and during flare; b) Aircraft firm landing followed by a light bounce; c) Crew momentary unawareness of aircraft position (in the air) and intentional column pulling action, trying to smooth nose wheel contact with ground; d) The presence of a tailwind component during the flare phase above recommended 10kts limits; e) Aircraft's center of gravity at a slightly backward position but this factor is of marginal contribution only; f) The decision to land on damp runway 30, with tailwind component marginal to the maximum permitted (10kts), instead of a circling to land to the actual runway (12) in use or the decision to discontinue the approach via a go-around procedure; g) A bounce recovery at night (with less visual references) characterized by taking place very close to the ground (less than 20 feet) hence allowing for a very short reaction time from the PF and little control effectiveness of the aircraft (throttle retarded and normal configuration to land); h) The existing take-off / landing certification standards, which were based on the attainment of the landing reference speeds, and flight crew training that was based on the monitoring of and response to those speeds, hindering crew to detect degraded landing speed and sink rate.METAR: 20:30 UTC / 19:30 local time: LPPD 022030Z 15014KT 9999 -SHRA SCT016 14/12 Q099721:00 UTC / 20:00 local time: LPPD 022100Z 17013KT 9999 -SHRA SCT015 SCT030 13/12 Q0997Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: GPIAA Report number: 02/ACCID/2013 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane was parked on the platform at Annemasse Airport overnight. The temperature was -2Â°C and humidity was 98% with fog or low clouds as the pilot prepared for a 5-minute VFR flight to GenÃ¨ve-Cointrin Airport (GVA). The pilot started the takeoff from runway 12 at 08:38:18. Rotation occurred 19 seconds later. Several witnesses reported seeing the airplane with a high nose-up pitch attitude, with a low rate of climb. Three seconds after the rotation the ""Bank Angle"" warning, indicating excessive bank, and then the stall warning, was recorded several times on the CVR. Several witnesses saw the airplane turn sharply to the right and then to the left. Fifteen seconds after the rotation, the left main landing gear struck the roof of a house about 500 m from the threshold of runway 30 at Annemasse. The airplane then collided with the ground. During the impact sequence, all three elements in the landing gear and the left wing were torn away from the rest of the aeroplane.

All nine on board were killed. The airplane was chartered by Minera AurÃ­fera Retamas SA (MARSA) to transport seven employees to a mining site. It took off from Lima at 06:25 hours local time, bound for Pias, Peru. After flying over the PÃ­as lagoon and seeing that the surrounding areas were covered by low clouds, especially the stretch from the beginning of the turn to the final leg of approach to the aerodrome, the crew chose to fly over the aerodrome in the opposite direction to the landing (140Â°). The flight then turned to the right and moved away on a course of approximately 170Â°, in order to make, a teardrop approach at low altitude and intercept the landing trajectory at heading 320Â°.

The aircraft was substantially damaged, and there were no injuries to the 148 occupants. Weather at the time of the event was reported as winds from 340 degrees at 6 knots, clear skies and 10 miles visibility. According to the flight crew, the preflight, departure and enroute segments of the flight were normal. The approach was flown with a Vref speed of 129 knots and 25 degrees of flap. Upon landing, the first officer called ""speedbrakes not activated"" and manually deployed the speedbrakes. The captain reported he felt the airplane ""float"" and attempted to maintain landing attitude. FDR data indicated that the airplane made an initial touchdown, followed by a brief gear squat switch deactivation, consistent with a slight bounce or light touchdown; the speedbrakes were then manually deployed. Airspeed decayed to approximately 115 knots and pitch attitude increased to about 11 degrees. The Delta 757/767 Flight Crew Training Manual specifies that contact with the runway is possible with pitch attitude greater than 10.5 degrees, with flaps 25 and airspeed of 10 knots below Vref.

The PNF recalled that during the landing roll, while the aircraft was braking and the indicated airspeed was below 90 kts, the nose gear suddenly collapsed. Both propellers contacted the runway surface and the aircraft quickly came to a halt resting on its nose. The Flight Crew then shutdown both engines, requested fire service assistance, selected batteries & generators to OFF and evacuated the aircraft through the cabin door. The Airport Fire Fighting personnel were on the scene within two minutes. There was no fire. The PF reported that it was a foggy day and that the approach was flown on limits with a lot of tension because of the uncertainty as to whether the aircraft would be able to land at Dublin. He described how concerns that fog might roll in raised his stress levels during the approach. During the landing roll, the landing gear selector was inadvertently moved to the UP position. This mistake was immediately recognised and the selector was returned to the DOWN position, but the nose-wheel retraction, which had been initiated, continued. The PF was unable to say definitively why the landing gear selector may have been mis-selected to UP, but he said that the intention may have been to move the Flap Selector instead. PROBABLE CAUSE: 1. Inadvertent selection of the landing gear selector to the UP position during the landing roll. CONTRIBUTORY CAUSES: 1. Reduced task focus by the PF following a tense and stressful limits approach. 2. Inactive landing gear interlock protection system due to the aircraft speed.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIU Report number: AAIU Report No. 2013-010 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) Timo Blossfeld; Hamburg-FuhlsbÃ¼ttel Airport (HAM/EDDH); 25 May 2008 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Both crew members were killed. The flight had originally departed Anchorage, AK (ANC) about 05:44, and made a scheduled stop at King Salmon, AK (AKN), before continuing on to the next scheduled stop, Dillingham, AK (DLG). As the airplane approached Dillingham, the flight crew requested the RNAV GPS 19 instrument approach to the Dillingham Airport about 07:57 from controllers at the Anchorage Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC). The ARTCC specialist on duty subsequently granted the request by issuing the clearance, with instructions to proceed direct to the Initial Approach Fix (IAF) to begin the approach, and to maintain an altitude of 2,000 feet or above. A short time later the flight crew requested to enter a holding pattern at the IAF so that they could contact the Flight Service Station (FSS) for a runway conditions report, and the ARTCC specialist granted that request. The ARTCC specialist then made several attempts to contact the aircraft, but was unsuccessful and subsequently lost radar track on the aircraft. An ELT signal indicated it had come down in the Muklung Hills. The wreckage was located the next day at an altitude of 2000 feet on the south side of the Muklung Hills. The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The flight crew's failure to maintain terrain clearance, which resulted in controlled flight into terrain in instrument meteorological conditions. Contributing to the accident were the flight crew's failure to correctly read back and interpret clearance altitudes issued by the air traffic controller, their failure to adhere to minimum altitudes depicted on the published instrument approach chart, and their failure to adhere to company checklists.METAR: 16:45 UTC / 08:45 local time: PADL 081645Z 10017G30KT 7SM -RA OVC015 01/01 A2909Wind 100 degrees at 17 knots, gusting to 30 knots; Visibility: 7 miles; light rain; overcast cloud deck at 1500 feet AGL; Temperature: 1Â°C, dew point: 1Â°CAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ANC13FA030 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Anchorage Daily News   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; ca 32 km N of Dillingham, AK; March 2013; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; ca 32 km N of Dillingham, AK; March 2013; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; ca 32 km N of Dillingham, AK; March 2013; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; ca 32 km N of Dillingham, AK; March 2013; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; ca 32 km N of Dillingham, AK; March 2013; (publicdomain) photo (c) Timo Blossfeld; Anchorage-Ted Stevens International Airport, AK (ANC/PANC); 09 June 2011 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Two of the four persons on board were killed. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the business flight that departed Tulsa-Richard Lloyd Jones Jr. Airport, OK (RVS), at 13:58 CDT. According to preliminary air traffic control information, at 16:10, the accident pilot established radio communications with South Bend Approach Control while at 11,000 feet mean sea level (msl). The air traffic controller cleared the flight direct to KNUTE intersection and told the pilot to expect a visual approach to runway 9R. At 16:11, the flight was cleared to descend to 10,000 feet msl. At 16:13, the flight was cleared to 3,000 feet msl. At 16:15, the approach controller told the pilot to make a 5-degree left turn to align with runway 9R and asked the pilot to report when he had the airport in sight. At 16:15:07, the pilot declared an emergency because of a lack of engine power, reporting that they were ""dead stick"" and without any power. About 23 seconds later, at 16:15:30, the pilot transmitted ""we've lost all power, and we have no hydraulics."" When the controller asked if the airplane remained controllable, the pilot replied ""ah, barely controllable."" The controller advised that all runways at South Bend were available for landing and issued the current winds, which were 130-degrees at 10 knots. At 16:15:22, the pilot transmitted that the airplaneÂs navigational systems were inoperative and requested a radar vector toward the airport. The controller replied that the airport was 9 miles directly ahead of the airplane's current position. At 16:16:12, the controller told the pilot to turn 10-degrees left to intersect runway 9R. At 16:16:15, the pilot replied ""26DK, turning left."" No additional voice communications were received from the accident airplane. The approach controller continued to transmit radar vectors toward runway 9R without any response from the accident pilot. At 16:18:58, the approach controller told the accident airplane to go-around because the main landing gear was not extended. (The tower controller had informed the approach controller that only the nose landing gear was extended) The accident airplane was then observed to climb and enter a right traffic pattern for runway 9R. The airplane made another landing approach to runway 9R with only the nose landing gear extended. Several witnesses observed the airplane bounce several times on the runway before it ultimately entered a climbing right turn. The airplane was then observed to enter a nose low descent into a nearby residential community. The airplane came down in a street, crashing into a house near the 1600 block of N. Iowa Street, South Bend. The accident location is approx 1000 metres south of the end of runway 09R. Factual information released by the NTSB suggest that the pilot-rated passenger was allowed to fly the descent under supervision of the captain. The pilot-rated passenger had accumulated 1,576 hours in multi-engine airplanes and 301 hours in single-engine airplanes. He had no experience in turbine-powered business jets. During the descent the captain instructed the passenger to ""just pull the power out"" in order to slow the airplane down. Apparently the passenger lifted the pull-up locks on the throttles and retarded the throttles beyond flight idle, into the fuel cut-off position. The pilot told the pilot-rated-passenger ""you went back behind the stops and we lost power."" During the approach the pilot was able to restart engine number 1. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The private pilot's inadequate response to the dual engine shutdown during cruise descent, including his failure to adhere to procedures, which ultimately resulted in his failure to maintain airplane control during a single-engine go-around. An additional cause was the pilot's decision to allow the unqualified pilot-rated passenger to manipulate the airplane controls, which directly resulted in the inadvertent dual engine shutdown.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN13FA196 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years Download report:  Final report Sources: ADN.com  Flightaware  WSBT   Location  Images: photo (c) Mark Parren; near South Bend Regional, IN (SBN); 17 March 2013 photo (c) NTSB; near South Bend Regional, IN (SBN); 18 March 2013 photo (c) NTSB; near South Bend Regional, IN (SBN); 18 March 2013 photo (c) NTSB; near South Bend Regional, IN (SBN); 18 March 2013 photo (c) NTSB; near South Bend Regional, IN (SBN); 18 March 2013 photo (c) Walt Barkley; La Verne-Brackett Field, CA (POC/); 04 May 2012 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

One of the two crew members was killed. The airplane was flying to an agricultural field for a crop spraying flight on March 22 when it suffered a loss of engine power. A forced landing was carried out and it was established that the carburettor had failed. The carburettor was replaced and the engine was test run. On March 23 the airplane took off again. Shortly after takeoff the engine lost power. The pilot was forced to ditch the plane in a pond. The airplane flipped over and came to rest inverted in the pond. Probable cause (translated from Russian): The cause of the crash of the AN-2 RA-02203 was a nose-over during a forced landing on the water surface. The emergency landing was caused by falling power and auto shutdown of the engine in flight because of the destruction of the exhaust manifold header pipe and carburetor intake valve burnout with the further penetration of exhaust gas with high temperature in the carburetor of the engine input device. The destruction of the exhaust manifold header pipe, most probably originated on the mechanism of corrosion under tension in the heating of the material during operation of the engine on automobile gasoline. Power factor that led to the formation of an initial crack most probably were the residual stresses in the material production of origin, arising in the process of making the header pipe. According to the documentation the last overhaul of the manifold was made at 27.01.2009 at Shakhtinskiy RHA DOSAAF. Based on the submitted documents, the Commission has found no evidence of actual repairs on the manifold, as the marking on the only remaining tag indicates that the section was overhauled at plant No. 420GA in October 1983.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: State Emergency Ministry Krasnodar region  MAK Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC)   Location  Images: photo (c) State Emergency Ministry Krasnodar region; near Vostochnaya, Ust'-Labinsk Region; 23 March 2013 photo (c) MAK Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC); near Vostochnaya, Ust'-Labinsk Region; 24 March 2013 photo (c) MAK Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC); near Vostochnaya, Ust'-Labinsk Region; March 2013 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

On approach to runway 10, the captain and first officer discussed approach and landing considerations due to the strong crosswinds, and it was decided that the first officer would continue the approach. Immediately prior to landing, the first officer experienced difficulty, so control of the aircraft was transferred to the captain. The transfer of control was completed less than 2 seconds prior to landing. The aircraft touched down on the left main wheel, bounced, and landed hard on the nosewheel; the nose landing gear collapsed due to overstress failures. Directional control was lost, and the aircraft skidded on its nose and came to rest 96 feet off the north side of the runway. There were no injuries, and the aircraft was substantially damaged. The investigation determined that, when control of the aircraft was passed to the captain, there was insufficient time to position the aircraft for a successful landing due to the substantial crosswind. The Air Labrador Twin Otter standard operating procedures (SOPs) do not state when the captain should permit the first officer to act as pilot flying or relieve the first officer from that role. When allowing the first officer to fly in challenging conditions, the captain must be prepared to take control of the aircraft in adequate time to ensure the safety of the flight. Also, there is an increased risk of a landing accident if a required briefing is not conducted. Crew members may not share a common plan for the approach and landing, and, as in this case, transfer of control may not be conducted in a timely manner. Findings as to causes and contributing factors: 1. The captain permitted the first officer to continue with a challenging approach. 2. Control of the aircraft was passed to the captain with insufficient time to position the aircraft for a successful landing. 3. The aircraft landed hard, resulting in the collapse of the nose gear due to overstress failures. Findings as to risk: 1. If a required briefing is not conducted, the crew members may not share a common plan for the approach and landing, and the transfer of control may not be completed in a timely manner, increasing the risk of a landing accident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A13A0033 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The crew performed an ILS Category 1 (CAT I) approach to runway 36R. The weather conditions are such that operating low visibility procedures (LVP) prevailed. During the transition from the stabilization of height 1000 ft, the aircraft speed was 57 knots greater than the approach speed. At 140 feet, an inappropriate increase in thrust by autothrottles maintained the aircraft at a high speed. The aircraft landed long and the touched down 1600 meters after the 36R threshold. The plane overran at a speed of 75 knots and came to rest about 300 meters beyond the runway end. Causes of the Accident: Continuing an approach below the stabilisation height with a speed significantly higher than the approach speed shows that the crew were not adequately aware of the situation, even though they mentioned several times their doubts on the marginal meteorological conditions and on the difficulties in reducing the aeroplaneÂs speed. Continuing this unstabilised approach at an excessive approach speed triggered, below 150 ft, an uncommanded increase in engine thrust. The crewÂs delayed A/THR reduction below 20 ft made it impossible for the aeroplane to slow down sufficiently for about 15 seconds after passing the threshold. After descending through 20 ft, the copilotÂs inappropriate flare technique and the dual input phenomenon caused by the Captain significantly lengthened the flare phase. The remaining runway distance after the touchdown made it impossible for the aeroplane to stop before the end of the runway. The following factors contributed to continuing the unstabilised approach and the long flare: - a flight duty period of nearly 15 hours which likely led to crew fatigue; - incomplete preparation of the approach which meant the crew was not aware of the risks on the day (tailwind, wet runway); - the non-application of ATC procedures that require controllers to ensure aircraft are provided with localiser interception at the latest 10 NM from the runway threshold, with a maximum convergence of 30Â° and a maximum speed of 160 kt; - partial application of standard procedures (SOP), impaired task sharing and degraded CRM, which meant the crew was unable to manage optimally the aeroplaneÂs deceleration. These factors contributed to a progressive deterioration in situational awareness that meant that they could not envisage rejecting the approach and landing; - the A/THR anomaly which maintained the aeroplane at a high energy level during the landing phase; - an inadequate procedure for taking over the controls that led to the dual input phenomenon. The following organisational factors contributed to the crewÂs poor performance: - the choice of flight crew recruitment profiles by the operator, motivated by economic considerations, and inadequate airline conversion, led to operating aeroplanes with crews that were relatively inexperienced on type and in their roles as captain or copilot; - improper and inappropriate application of the regulatory provisions that allow an extension of flight duty time in case of ""unexpected circumstances"" without taking into account the predictable risk of excessive fatigue for the crew; - the absence of suitable initial oversight which made it impossible for the HCAA to focus on the predictable potential operational weaknesses of Hermes Airlines.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Report number: sx-s130329.en Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  2 February 2016 SX-BHS Daallo Airlines, lsf Hermes Airlines 1 near Mogadishu International Airport (MGQ) sub Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane incurred substantial damage and there were no injuries to the 192 occupants. The captain was the pilot flying and the first officer was the pilot monitoring. According to flight crew statements, the takeoff, climb, cruise and descent were uneventful. Prior to descent, the captain briefed a visual approach to runway 25L at LAS, which would be backed up by the instrument landing system (ILS). He also included a brief of the A321's 7.5 degree pitch limit. The crew reported that visual meteorological conditions with light and variable winds were initially reported at LAS, however, the winds (VMC) became gusty around the time of the accident. The captain stated that, once he turned off the autopilot while on the approach to runway 25L, he thought ""the winds seemed a little stronger..."" than what was reported, and it felt ""a little squirrelly"". According to the flight crew, the approach was stabilized, on speed, and on glide path. Flaps were selected FULL and autobrakes were selected LOW. The approach speed was 158 knots. When the captain began to initiate the flare within about 20 feet above the ground and pitched up ""just a tad"" for the flare, but stated he did not feel any pitch response, so he brought the nose up a little more to arrest the descent. Upon initial touchdown, he estimated that they bounced about 5-10 feet back into the air and the airplane struck its tail on the second touchdown.  Postaccident investigation revealed substantial damage to the underbelly and aft bulkhead area. The skin was abraded over a large area through its thickness in several areas of the pressure vessel . One frame was fractured along with several fractured shear ties and frame clips. Probable Cause: the captain's improper recovery from a bounced landing which resulted in a tailstrike.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA13FA071 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 7 years Download report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft had been in Lanseria Airport for a maintenance check. Prior to the planned flight, the aircraft underwent flight check for 45 minutes after completed planned maintenance on April 6th, flown by the Captain and another pilot. The aircraft departed FALA to FYOA for its first stop over with a flight time of 03:35h. The planned departure from FYOA was delayed due to trouble in starting the right engine. The aircraft took off at 10:21 hrs contrary to planned 08:30 hrs. For the second leg of the flight, the aircraft departed FYOA to FPST with a filed flight plan of 5 hours and 20 minutes (flight time) having FYOA as alternate. Leaving the Namibian airspace the pilot only contacted Luanda ATC and SÃ£o TomÃ© Tower as destination. At the time of the flight the west coast of Africa in the vicinity of Gulf of Guinea had widespread moderate to severe thunderstorm activity with lighting and heavy rain. When initiating descent to SÃ£o TomÃ© from FL 200 to 4000 feet as instructed by SÃ£o TomÃ© ATC, the pilot was advised that weather was gradually deteriorating at the airport. At 16:10 hrs the pilot had the last radio contact with SÃ£o TomÃ© Tower, informing them about his position which was 9 nm inbound to SÃ£o TomÃ© VOR at 4000 feet and also informed the ATC that he was encountering heavy rain. Having lost contact with the aircraft at 16:13 hrs, the SÃ£o TomÃ© ATC tried several times to contact the airplane  A Search and Rescue operation started on 7 April 2013 the same day the accident occurred and was conducted on the sea and on the island; no trace of aircraft or its debris, pilot or any cargo were found. The search was terminated on 20 April at 1730hrs. Probable Causal Factors By the fact that there is no evidence of the crash, the cause of the accident cannot be conclusively decided, however the investigation discovered series of discrepancies and non-compliance which includes: a. Pilot: i. Planned long flight as solo pilot from Lanseria to Bamako is excessive for pilot fatigue perspective (over 15 hours flying). ii. The First Class FAA (USA) medical Certificate issued on April 23rd 2012 had expired on October 31st 2012. b. Meteorological Conditions: i. Adverse weather conditions enroute and on arrival on that day, the west coast of Africa in the vicinity of Gulf of Guinea had widespread moderate to severe thunderstorm activity with lighting and heavy rain. When initiating descent to Sao Tome, the pilot was advised that weather was gradually deteriorating at airport vicinity.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CNIPAIA Report number: GT/07/04/2013/RF Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 years and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Angop  Small Plane With U.S. Pilot Missing Off West Africa (AP, 12-4-2013)   Location  Images: photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Lanseria Airport (HLA/FALA); January 2004 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

While taking off after a touch-and-go landing, a takeoff configuration warning was generated. The commander rejected the takeoff and brought the aircraft to a halt on the remainder of the runway. The nose landing gear sustained some damage as the aircraft de-rotated on to the nosewheel during the manoeuvre. The crew did not consider the touchdown on the nose landing gear to be excessive and were not aware of the damage.  After a short delay, the training detail was continued. On the subsequent takeoff, with the co-pilot as PF, an ECAM message, l/g shock absorber fault was generated. This meant that the landing gear could not be retracted and that the autopilot and autothrust were unusable. During the climbout the aircraft started to descend so the commander took control and resumed the climb to circuit altitude.  After considering the status of the aircraft, the commander cancelled the training detail and the aircraft was diverted to a maintenance base. The available evidence suggested that the configuration warning resulted from the speed brake lever being inadvertently placed in the speed brake range, during the touch-and-go landing, in such a position that it did not command spoiler surface deflection. The timing of this selection indicated that it occurred when the ground spoilers were being disarmed by the commander pressing the lever downwards. This then caused the takeoff config warning to be activated after takeoff power was set, and the commander rejected the takeoff.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: EW/C2013/04/01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: 1. https://www.gov.uk/aaib-reports/airbus-a320-214-g-ozby-10-april-2013  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates11-Jul-2014 10:12 harro Added 18-Dec-2014 15:18 Dr. John Smith Updated [Date, Location, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Embed code, ]31-Oct-2024 07:55 ASN Updated [Other fatalities, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The flight departed Bandung at 13:45 with the copilot as Pilot Flying. About 15:00 the flight was descending towards Bali and the crew received vectors for a VOR DME approach for runway 09. At 15:08, with the aircraft at approximately 1,600 ft AGL, the Tower controller saw the aircraft on finals and gave a landing clearance with additional information that the wind condition was 120Â° at 5 kts. While descending through 900 feet the copilot stated that the runway was not in sight. Since the captain noted a flashing light at the beginning of the runway, he responded: ""OK. Approach light in sight, continue"". At 15:09:33, after the EGPWS called out ""Minimum"" at an altitude of approximately 550 ft AGL, the pilot disengaged the autopilot and the auto throttle and continued the descent. The airplane then entered an area of rainfall and the outside environment became totally dark. At 150 ft AGL the captain took over control. The copilot handed the control to the captain and stated that he could not see the runway. At 15:10:01, the EGPWS called out ""Twenty"", and the captain commanded a go around. One second later the aircraft impacted the water. The aircraft stopped facing to the north at about 20 meters from the shore or approximately 300 meters south west of the beginning runway 09.

The airspeed then decreased to below the planned Vapp of 138 knots. At 17:37 the airplane passed the threshold at 131 knots. The airplane touched down 155 meters past the threshold at a speed of 136 knots and a vertical gravity of 1,965 g. Pitch angle was 6.7Â° and touchdown occurred at an angle of attack of 15.5Â°. The aircraft bounced as thrust was increased, touching down again about 491 meters from the threshold. Pitch angle was 10.9Â° and the angle of attack was 23.2Â° with a vertical gravity of 1.715 g. The underside of the tail contacted the runway, causing substantial abrasion damage 100 cm wide and 600 cm long, including wear-through. Eleven interior frames were cracked. The Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board (ARAIB) determines that the causes of this accident were: 1) The pilot flying (PF) failed to maintain the proper approach speed until the flare just before touchdown, and the airplane bounced on touchdown since higher-than-normal vertical gravity was applied due to a high sink rate and increased thrust and speed just before touchdown; and 2) The airplane made a second touchdown at the pitch attitude exceeding an A321 airplane's limitation and sustained a tail strike since the PF failed to keep thrust at idle and establish the proper pitch attitude during the bounce.  Contributing to this accident were: 1) the inadequate training program dealing with the recovery form the bounce;  2) lack of pre-landing preparation due to a failure to conduct an approach briefing on pitch attitude;  3) the PF's failure to properly allocate his attention due to his delegation of flight control to the pilot monitoring (PM) who failed to meet flight control requirements;  4) the PM's inadequate advice and monitoring due to the PF's failure to make standard callouts;  5) the disconnection of the autothrottle and a failure to manually control thrust and speed; and  6) a failure to execute a go-around when stabilized approach criteria are not met.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ARAIB Report number: ARAIB/AAR1303 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

At 14:58 AeromÃ©xico flight 002 took off from Madrid on a scheduled flight to Mexico City, Mexico. On board were three pilots, six flight attendants and 154 passengers. During takeoff the tail impacted runway 36L, causing substantial damage to the underside of the tail. While climbing to FL140 the cabin failed to pressurize as expected. Then the oxygen masks deployed in the cabin. At 15:20 the flight crew informed the controller at Madrid that they were returning due to pressurization problems. The airplane entered a holding pattern and landed safely on runway 18R at 16:25. Air Europa flight 71 to Caracas, Venezuela took off at 15:29 and suffered a punctured nose gear tyre, probably after running over debris left on the runway after the AÃ©romexico tailstrike. AEA71 was the seventh flight to take off from runway 36L following the AeromÃ©xico plane. The Airbus A330-200, EC-JPF, entered a holding pattern off the southern coast of Portugal at FL100 and landed safely back at Madrid at 19:39. Causes (translated from Spanish): The accident occurred because the aircraft rotated at a speed much lower than necessary because it had been incorrectly calculated during the dispatch, based on the weight of the aircraft with zero fuel (ZFW) instead of the takeoff weight of the aircraft (TOW). Then the error was not detected by the crew when entering data into the FMS. Contributing factors: - The On-Board Performance Tool (OPT) was recently introduced in the company. - The experience of both the dispatch officer as well as crew members was insufficient in this area. - The On-Board Performance Tool (OPT) was not installed at the Madrid station so that the transmission of the information was not performed according to procedures.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIAIAC Report number: A-010/2013 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: CIAIAC   Location  Images: photo (c) Kentaro Iemoto; Tokyo-Narita Airport (NRT/RJAA); 16 July 2011; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane was based at Kandahar and operated by the US Air Force on a combat intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) mission. The airplane, callsign Independence 08, departed Kandahar at 11:57 and entered orbit at 12:29. Upon entering the operating area about 12:29, they encountered a cloud deck partially covering their orbit area and a large, rapidly building towering cumulous cloud in the center of their orbit area from 17,000 ft to 24,000 ft mean sea level (MSL). The towering cumulus clouds began to grow and drift into the airplane's orbit, prompting a request to climb from 20,000 ft to 23,000 ft. This translates to climbing from 13,800 to 16,800 ft above ground level. The airplane was in a left hand orbit, preparing to shift the orbit, when the pilot initiated the climb with the autopilot on at 12:40:40. While or just after initiating the climb, the pilot continued working an orbit adjustment to better service tracking an active target, and approximately ten seconds after the climb was initiated, the climb rate increased. Fifteen seconds afterward the pilot noticed he had allowed the airspeed to decrease during the climb, stating, ""A little slow, correcting."" Seven seconds later, the mission commander in the right hand seat said, ""Alright, firewall,"" meaning to advance the throttles as far forward as they would go, and one second later, the auto-pilot was disengaged. The propellers on the MC-12W do not counter-rotate, and advancing the power in the MC-12W produces left-handed torque and P-factor, creating a left yaw and making the aircraft to want to turn left; the airplane was already in a left-hand turn and left bank. Two seconds after calling to ""firewall"" the throttles, and one second after auto-pilot disengagement, the bank angle warning tone sounded, indicating the left bank had rapidly increased to greater than 50 degrees. The mission commander again called for full power, and four seconds later, he directed ""eyes inside,"" telling the pilot to refer to his instruments for attitude and airspeed information; contemporaneously, the stall warning sounded. The stall warning horn stopped after five seconds, and a second later, background noise indicates items began flying around within the cockpit and the bank angle warning stopped. The pilot stated: ""Whoa, pull up"". The mission commander then advised the pilot to look at his airspeed and took over the aircraft, calling for a reduction in power. Four seconds after the mission commander took the aircraft, the aircraft overspeed warning sounded, followed by the landing gear horn sounding. The landing gear horn indicates the throttles were reduced toward idle, and it did not sound until 15 seconds after initial stall warning sounded. The MA reached a maximum recorded height of 20,900 ft. and lost approximately 15,000 ft before impacting the ground. The airplane impacted with the fuselage slightly nose-low, in a left bank, with minimal forward momentum. The airplane was destroyed upon impact and burned during the post-crash fire . CONCLUSION: ""I find by clear and convincing evidence the cause of the mishap was a stall due to insufficient airspeed, while in a climbing left turn, which developed into a left spin followed quickly by a high-speed spiral, from which the crew was unable to recover. Additionally, I find, by a preponderance of evidence, each of the following three factors substantially contributed to the  mishap: (1) orbit weather that impeded visibility and masked the horizon; (2) pilot inexperience in the MC-12W; and (3) known MC-12W program risks associated with sustaining required combat capability in theater.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: USAF AIB Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Army Times   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

All seven crew members were killed in the accident. The accident flight was operated as part of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) to transport military equipment. The original schedule was for the crew to operate flight NCR510 from Chateauroux, France to Camp Bastion, Afghanistan, and then continue to the Dubai World Center at Al Aktoum, UAE. Because no Pakistan over-flight permit was obtained, the flight was re-routed as NCR102 to operate from Camp Bastion to Bagram, refuel, and continue NCR102 from Bagram to Dubai.  According to the load manifest, while in Camp Bastion, the airplane was loaded by National Air Cargo ground personnel with 94,119 kg of cargo, including 5 Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) armored military vehicles that were loaded on the main deck of the airplane. Two of these vehicles weighed about 12 tons each, and the other three weighed about 18 tons each. It was the first time National Airlines had transported 18-ton military vehicles when they were loaded on the accident airplane in Camp Bastion. The airplane departed Camp Bastion at 07:45Z and arrived into Bagram at 09:23Z (13:53 local time). On arrival into Bagram, the crew experienced a brake overheat condition after landing on runway 03. The crew parked the airplane on the Foxtrot ramp and ran a checklist to address the brake temperature indications in the cockpit, and discussed the required cooling time of 1 to 1.5 hours.  The crew did not take on any additional cargo in Bagram, and only took on fuel for the flight to Dubai.  At about 14:27 hours local time while the airplane was still on the ramp in Bagram, the captain was made aware of a broken strap found by one of the other crewmembers, and the cockpit crew had a discussion about a possible shift of the cargo load during landing in Bagram. There was additional discussion on re-securing the load prior to departure. Flight NCR102 taxied out normally for departure on runway 03 at Bagram at 15:14. After receiving clearance, takeoff was commenced at 15:26. The takeoff roll appeared normal. The airplane rotated normally around the Charlie intersection of the runway. Approximately 9 seconds after the crew called to rotate the airplane, the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) stopped recording, and approximately 3 seconds later the flight data recorder (FDR) stopped recording. According to witnesses and video evidence, after becoming airborne, the airplane continued to pitch up until it appeared to stall, turn to the right, then descended to impact with the ground just beyond the departure end of runway 03 and to the right.  An investigation of the wreckage revealed at least the aft-most MRAP broke loose of its restraints during takeoff, shifted aft and damaged the FDR/CVR before penetrating the aft pressure bulkhead. The MRAPÂs aft movement was determined to have compromised at least Hydraulic Systems #1 and #2 and may have contacted the stabilizer jackscrew assembly.

Upon takeoff, a flight control system malfunction, the board found, generated directional instability, causing the aircraft's nose to slowly drift from side-to-side or ""rudder-hunt."" This condition, not fully diagnosed by the crew, progressed into a more dangerous oscillatory instability known as a ""Dutch roll."" The board identified that a poor layout of key information in the inflight manual and insufficient crew training contributed to the mishap by detracting from the crew's ability to act on critical information during their troubleshooting to turn off either of two cockpit switches which may have eliminated the malfunction. Having not recognized the Dutch roll condition, the crew initiated a left turn to remain on-course along the planned route of flight and used a small amount of left rudder to coordinate the turn. The use of rudder, while in a Dutch roll, increased the aircraft's oscillatory instability. The ensuing large side-to-side movements of the aircraft varied the crew member's foot pressure on the rudder pedal which caused inadvertent fluctuations in rudder position. These fluctuating rudder movements, coupled with slight right rudder use while rolling out of the turn, compounded the Dutch roll severity and produced extreme airframe stress that caused the KC-135's tail section to separate from the aircraft. The subsequent, uncontrollable descent resulted in an in-flight explosion.Sources: Air Mobility Command Public Affairs  Kloop.kg 3-5-2013  CNN 3-5-2013   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

During the en-route phase at cruising level, a diversion was made to circumnavigate a cloud formation with high vertical development and the descent was initiated later than planned.  The flight crew was cleared for an instrument approach, but carried out a missed approach because the runway was not in sight. Authorization was requested to change to visual flight rules, which was approved by the controller. The flight crew then initiated a visual approach by flying a short base leg, ending with a small radius turn to align with the runway. During this turn, the crew neglected to control and monitor the airspeed because the captain was looking for the runway and the first officer was reviewing the procedures according to the checklist. The aircraft stalled and lost altitude, striking a house in a residential area about 1 nautical mile from the threshold of runway 10. The accident resulted in the complete destruction of the aircraft, a house, part of two other houses, seven vehicles and a perimeter wall of the area where it fell. The probable cause was not operating the aircraft according to the procedures and parameters established by the manufacturer, in addition to the lack of situational awareness of the captain and the first officer and the failure to comply with briefings in all phases of flight operation, focused on activities that were not related to the conduct of the flight. The physical factor is considered as a contributing factor as bad weather conditions added difficulty to the flight.METAR: 13:00 UTC /  local time: METAR SVVA 051300Z 14006KT 0100 +TSSH FEW013CB OVC016 21/20 Q101614:00 UTC /  local time: METAR SVVA 051400Z 02004KT 1000 +TSRA FEW013CB OVC016 21/20 Q1017Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JIAAC Venezuela Report number: 011/2013 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: Noticias 24  El Universal   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft sustained substantial damage and the three passengers onboard were not injured. The airplane had just undergone a flight management system (FMS) upgrade at a maintenance facility in Grand Junction, and this was both its first flight, and its home base return flight, following the upgrade. The pilot reported that the flight and landing approach were uneventful. As the airplane touched down on runway 22, the pilot deployed the spoilers, and then pulled the power levers to the thrust reverser detent position; however, the deploy indicators did not illuminate. He then recycled the thrust levers back into the detent, but again the reversers did not deploy. Both the pilot and copilot attempted to troubleshoot as the airplane continued along the runway. The pilot then applied pressure to the foot pedal brakes, but did not feel a response; the copilot also attempted, but reported that the pedals felt loose and the airplane did not slow down. As the airplane approached the threshold, the pilot engaged the steering lock switch, and attempted to steer the nose wheel, but the airplane did not respond. Just prior to reaching the runway end, he activated the emergency braking lever; however, the airplane rolled off the runway end, through a set of instrument landing system antennas, and down an embankment. Subsequent examination revealed that the mounting screws for both the left and right main landing gear squat switches were loose, such that the switches had backed away from their mounting pads. The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: Failure of maintenance personnel to reattach the landing gear squat switches following maintenance, which rendered the airplane's steering, braking, and thrust reverser systems inoperative during landing. Contributing to the accident were the failure of both the maintenance facility mechanics and the airplane operator's mechanic and flight crew to identify the error during post maintenance checks, a failure of the airplane's pilot to apply the emergency brakes in a timely manner, and the copilot's decision to attempt to engage the thrust reversers as the airplane approached the runway end despite multiple indications that they were inoperative and producing partial forward, rather than reverse, thrust.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: WPR13FA227 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; McMinnville Municipal Airport, OR; May 2013; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; McMinnville Municipal Airport, OR; May 2013; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Two crew members and one passenger sustained serious injuries. The airplane departed Pokhara Airport (PKR) at 08:10 on a domestic flight to Jomsom. While descending towards the destination airport, the Jomsom controller reported that there was a south-westerly 8-12 knot wind with runway 24 in use. During the approach the pilot in command took over the communication function of the copilot and contacted Jomsom Tower, requesting to use runway 06 instead of runway 24, despite the advice of the tower controller to use runway 24 to avoid tail wind effect in runway 06.  The tailwind component, exceeded the five knot tailwind limit stipulated in the companyÂs standard operating procedure. The airplane touched down 776 feet past the threshold of the 2,424-foot-long runway 06. It covered a distance of 194 feet on the airstrip and veered towards the grassland.  During the landing roll, when the aircraft was decelerating, the co-pilot had raised the flaps as per the existing practice of carrying out the after the landing checks."" The pilot in command added power to re-enter the runway. After running 705 feet on the grassland the airplane entered the runway again. Without making his intentions clear to the copilot, the pilot in command continued adding power for go around.  The accelerating aircraft gained insufficient speed and lift to take off and ran out of the runway 24 end, continued towards the river, hit the barbed fence and gabion wall with an initial impact and finally fell down onto the banks of Kaligandaki River. The most probable cause of the accident is the inappropriate conduct of STOL procedure and landing technique carried out by the PIC, during the landing-phase and an endeavour to carry out take off again with no sufficient airspeed, no required lifting force and non availability of required runway length to roll. Contributory factors to the occurrence is the absence of proper CRM in terms of communication, coordination and briefing in between crew members on intention and action being taken by PIC during pre and post landing phase.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Nepal AAIC Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: eKantipur  Hemant Arjyal  The Himalayan Times History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  16 October 2011 9N-ABO Nepal Airlines, opf Tara Air 0 Lukla Airport - VNLK min Taxiway excursion Location  Images: photo (c) pm subedi; Jomsom Airport (JMO/VNJS); 16 May 2013 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The four occupants of the aircraft were uninjured in the accident.  The approach to Campo de Marte was flown at VRef +10 kt, a little higher than recommended by the manufacturer. Also, the airplane was near its maximum landing weight.  The aircraft touched down on runway 12 at a position approximately 1000 m from the runway threshold. Some 900 m were necessary for landing, but the remaining runway distance was about 300 m. The inexperienced pilot (10 hours on type) attempted to use the emergency braking system, but pulled the wrong handle. He accidently raised the undercarriage. The airplane slid off the left side of the runway and came to rest in the grass. Contributing factors (translated from Portuguese): Concerning the operation of the aircraft  a) Application of commands - contributed  The final approach at a speed higher than anticipated, the touchdown at 1,000 meters from the runway threshold and the braking action without using the pedals show the inadequate use of controls of the aircraft.  b) Cockpit coordination - unspecified  There may not have been a proper cockpit coordination between the commander and his copilot. The distribution of tasks, accurate communication and consultation with the manufacturer's manuals could have prevented the accident.  c) Education - unspecified  It is possible that the captain did not receive adequate training in the operation of the aircraft, but it was not possible to prove the fact that the commander did not receive instruction.  d) Piloting judgement - contributed  There was no adequate judgement of the crew when it was decided to conduct an approach at a speed higher than recommended by the manufacturer and the touch down beyond the first third runway available.  e) Planning of flight - contributed  The weight of the aircraft to near maximum landing weight demanded increasing distance required for landing.  f) Low pilot experience - unspecified  Limited experience of the pilot in jet aircraft may have contributed to the occurrence. A better understanding into the aerodynamics, using graphics charts to calculate speeds and distances required for landing and simulator training could have been barriers to prevent this accident.  g) Management Oversight - unspecified  The lack of records of hours flown and inspections for a long period of time, demonstrate inadequate supervision of the responsible operation.  However, it was not proven that there was some sort of mechanical failure that could impair the braking system of the aircraft.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CENIPA Report number: A-097/CENIPA/2013 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) RenÃ© Ballo; Assis Airport, SP (AIF/SBAS); 1998 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were no injuries. The C-130, assigned to the 41st Airlift Squadron, 19th Airlift Wing, was conducting a medical evacuation when the accident occurred. The accident happened on the third of five planned legs that day to an airfield that was at 6,809 feet Mean Sea Level (MSL) and experiencing winds varying from 200 to 250 degrees gusting from 6 to 28 knots. On the second attempted landing, the aircraft touched down approximately 1,500 ft down the runway but was 27 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS) faster than computed touchdown landing speed leading to the aircraft going off the end of the runway at approximately 49 KIAS. It struck a ditch which collapsed the nose gear and eventually ripped the right main landing gear from the fuselage. The right outboard engine struck the ground, pressurized fuel and oil lines were broken, fluid was sprayed over the cracked engine casing, and the right wing caught fire. The aircraft came to a full stop at approximately 544 feet off the end of the paved runway surface. The Accident Investigation Board (AIB) president found, by clear and convincing evidence, that the causes of the accident were poor Crew Resource Management (CRM) and mishap pilot one's (MP1) late power reduction causing a 27 KIAS fast touchdown at a high altitude airfield (6,809 ft MSL). Additionally, the AIB President found by the preponderance of evidence that each of the following factors substantially contributed to the mishap: 1) Channelized Attention; 2) Risk Assessment; 3) Delayed Necessary Action; 4) Response Set; 5) Procedural Error.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: USAF AIB Report number: Executive summary report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Stars and Stripes 20-5-2013  Damn, this Afghan Airstrip Practically Eats American Planes (Medium.com 12-6-2013)   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

The aircraft overran runway 09 and traveled about 200 m over a grass area before crossing a perimeter road and impacting a fence. An emergency evacuation was performed during which two passengers were injured. Contributing factors (translated from Bulgarian): 1. Insufficient analysis of the general weather conditions as forecast and an underestimation of the actual weather by the meteorological office at Varna Airport ATS Centre and flight crew during descent of the aircraft. 2. Sharp, dynamic change in the parameters of wind speed and direction, just before touchdown the aircraft. 3. Failure by the flight crew to limit tail wind speed of the plane and wrong decision by the pilot to land, subject to weather conditions necessitating missed, balked landing, going to a holding area or alternate 4. Aircraft touched down around the middle of the runway at a speed greater than the speed of approach (Vapp). Automatic braking was disabled during braking by the pilot flying, as he was in arrears with the activation of the maximum speed of the brakes. 5. Increased workload of the captain: - Lack of experience of the co-pilot of the aircraft type; - Shortening the time for landing due to next scheduled flight of the plane.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIU Bulgaria Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

British Airways flight BA762 departed runway 27L on a scheduled service to Oslo, Norway. At that moment, the fan cowl doors from both engines detached, puncturing a fuel pipe on the right engine and damaging the airframe. The symptoms seen by the flight crew included: engine thrust control degradation, the loss of the yellow hydraulic system, and a significant fuel leak. After the loss of the yellow hydraulic system the crew declared a PAN, with the intention of returning to Heathrow once they had fully assessed the situation. ATC provided radar vectors for the ILS to runway 27R. During the approach to land, an external fire developed on the right engine. An engine fire warning on the flight deck prompted the crew to declare a MAYDAY.  Although both engine fire extinguisher bottles were discharged and the right engine was shut down, the fire was not completely extinguished. The left engine continued to perform normally throughout the flight. The aircraft landed safely and was brought to a stop on runway 27R at Heathrow. The airport fire service attended and quickly extinguished a small fire on the right engine. The passengers and crew evacuated via the escape slides on the left side of the aircraft, without injury. Causal factors The investigation identified the following causal factors: 1. The technicians responsible for servicing the aircraftÂs IDGs did not comply with the applicable AMM procedures, with the result that the fan cowl doors were left in an unlatched and unsafe condition following overnight maintenance. 2. The  pre-departure  walk-around  inspections  by  both  the pushback tug driver and the co-pilot did not identify that the fan cowl doors on both engines were unlatched. Contributory factors The investigation identified the following contributory factors: 1. The design of the fan cowl door latching system, in which the latches are positioned at the bottom of the engine nacelle in close proximity to the ground, increased the probability that  unfastened  latches  would  not  be  seen  during  the pre-departure inspections. 2. The lack of the majority of the high-visibility paint finish on the latch handles reduced the conspicuity of the unfastened latches. 3. The decision by the technicians to engage the latch handle hooks  prevented  the  latch  handles  from  hanging  down beneath the fan cowl doors as intended, further reducing the conspicuity of the unfastened latches.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: AAIB AAR 1/2015 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) AAIB; London-Heathrow Airport (LHR/EGLL); May 2013 photo (c) AAIB; London-Heathrow Airport (LHR/EGLL); 24 May 2013 photo (c) AAIB; London-Heathrow Airport (LHR/EGLL); 24 May 2013 photo (c) Willem GÃ¶ebel; Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS/EHAM) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Flight PK-209 from Lahore (LHE), Pakistan to Manchester (MAN) , U.K. was descending through an altitude of about FL235 when the crew issued a 7700 squawk code, signalling an emergency situation. The flight descended to FL160 and meanwhile RAF Typhoon jets were scrambled to escort the plane to London-Stansted where it landed safely on runway 23 at 13:10 UTC. Initial information suggests that two male passengers had repeatedly tried to get into the cockpit and started making threats. Both men were arrested after landing. A trial was started in November 2013. The prosecutor stated that both men made ""threats to kill members of the cabin crew, threats to kill passengers and threats to blow up the plane whilst it was in flight."" The situation ensued when cabin crew made an announcement asking for a medical professional to assist an elderly passenger who had fallen ill. One of the passengers offered to help but this was turned down because he had no medical credentials. He was then said to have issued threats, along with another passenger.Sources: Two held after RAF Typhoon jets escort Pakistan plane over UK (BBC, 24-5-2013)  Stansted emergency landing: Pair 'threatened to blow up plane' (BBC, 12-11-2013)  Images: photo (c) Miklos SZABO; Manchester Airport (MAN/EGCC); 28 August 2013 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Marie Airport, ON (YAM), Canada. There were no reported injuries. Porter Airlines flight 689 was on a visual short final approach to Sault Ste. Marie's Airport runway 30 when power was reduced to correct the descent profile. The aircraft's descent rate quickly increased and was not arrested with power application. The airspeed decreased, causing the approach to become unstabilized. The aircraft landed hard and during the landing flair the pitch angle increased such that the tail of the aircraft contacted the runway surface. There was significant damage to the aircraft skin and structure where it contacted the ground. The aircraft taxied to the gate without further incident. Findings as to causes and contributing factors: 1. Neither crew member identified that the airspeed had dropped below landing reference speed; the flight no longer met the requirements of a stabilized approach, and an overshoot was required. 2. The pilot monitoring did not identify the decreasing airspeed and increasing descent rate in time to notify the pilot flying or intervene. 3. In response to the pilot monitoring's warning to add power, the pilot flying pitched the nose up beyond the limits stated in the standard operating procedures and the manufacturer's pitch awareness training. 4. The high rate of descent coupled with the high nose-up attitude of the aircraft resulted in the hard landing that compressed the struts and allowed the tail to strike the runway. Findings as to risk 1. If standard operating procedures do not clearly define the requirements for a stabilized visual approach, there is an increased risk that continued flight could result in a landing accident. 2. If standard operating procedures do not clearly define the duties of the pilot monitoring, there is an increased risk that unsafe flight conditions could develop.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A13O0098 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: CADORS 2013O1292   Location  Images: photo (c) TSB; Sault Ste.

The airplane, operated by Deraya Air Taxi, departed Jayapura-Sentani Airport (DJJ) on a domestic cargo flight to Wamena Airport (WMX).  The captain acted as Pilot Flying and the first officer acted as Pilot Monitoring (PM). At 06:27 the aircraft departed from Sentani Airport and climbed to the cruising altitude of 12,000 feet.  The first officer contacted the Wamena Tower controller at 07:01, while the aircraft was approaching Pass Valley point. The controller informed that runway 15 was in use and the weather condition was wind calm, visibility 4 km, low cloud on finals and QNH 1008 mbs.  At 07:07, the first officer reported they were on final to runway 15. When reporting runway in sight two minutes later, the controller provided the clearance to land. On short final the aircraft was on heading 140Â° and was on the right side of the correct flight path. The pilot then rolled to the left up to 20Â° to align with the runway, then rolled to the right to align with runway 15. This correction was conducted at altitude between 400 to 200 feet AGL. The aircraft touched down on the centerline. During the landing roll at about 750 meters from the beginning of runway 15 the aircraft veered to the left of the runway shoulder, the pilot recovered by applying the right rudder and asymmetrical reverse thrust but the aircraft continued veer to the left and stopped at about 10 meters on the left shoulder of the runway 15. The nose landing gear detached and was found on the shoulder at about 250 meter from the aircraft's final position. The main landing gears were broken and all the propellers bent. Contributing Factors: The flight did not meet the criteria according to the recommended elements of stabilized approach which required go around. The aircraft touched down with 2Â° misalignment with the runway direction then the aircraft veered off to the left. The recovery action was not in accordance to the correct technique according to the ALAR Tool Kit.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSC Report number: KNKT.13.05.18.04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) NTSC; Wamena Airport (WMX); 31 May 2013 photo (c) NTSC; Wamena Airport (WMX); 31 May 2013 photo (c) NTSC; Wamena Airport (WMX); 31 May 2013 photo (c) NTSC; Wamena Airport (WMX); 31 May 2013 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Cebu Pacific Air flight 5J-971 was a domestic service from Manila (MNL) to Davao City.  The aircraft touched down on runway 23 at a point about 30 m before the marked touchdown point (TP) about 190 m from the threshold. The airplane came down on the right-half portion very near the right edge lights. The aircraft continued to the right edge of the runway until the right hand main landing gear fell-off the cemented runway at about 129 m from the touchdown point, followed by the nosegear and the left hand main gear about 511 m from TP. With all landing gears on the soft ground the aircraft rolled for about 330 m more with an indication of trying to return to runway and it momentarily crossed over the concrete entrance taxiway of the parking ramp before it made a full-stop on a grassy area ahead and near the runway, about 845 m from TP.  The passengers deplaned via the forward left-hand evacuation slide, which was deployed about fifteen minutes after landing. PROBABLE CAUSE  The Aircraft Accident Investigation and Inquiry Board determined that the probable causes of this accident are the following:  - PilotsÂ lack of event proficiency in low-visibility non-precision approach and landing at night. Human Factor. Pilot Error. Psychological (Psychomotor skill, recent experience). The PIC as pilot flying Pilot Flying (PF) failed to maintain a stabilized landing approach (under precipitation) until below the MDA so that moments before the touchdown (precipitation becoming heavy), the aircraft was still at left of runway centerline with the FO calling (to align) RIGHT which was done by PF but having lost grasp of the centerline, the correction exceeded the centerline with FO calling ( to correct toward the unlighted center ) LEFT but the aircraft already touched down aligned to the right edge lights that was misconstrued by the PF as the center lights ( based on the repeated expressions of the PF during the landing roll until the aircraft has fully stopped ).  - The emergency procedure for go-around was necessary but not utilized. Human Factor. Pilot Error. Psychological (Learning, Emotion/ Mental Narrowed Attention) The pilot probably was experiencing Narrowed Attention due to apprehension by being acutely conscious of the difficulty ahead ( bad weather ). Added to this was his proficiency status ( one flight to Davao in last 3 months ) and at confusion to notice things in the periphery of his attention i.e., to execute a go-around and make another approach well-prepared on the techniques with lower precipitation level. Contributory Factors:  - Adverse weather condition. Environmental factor. Natural Environment  The weather condition severely affected the judgment and decision-making of the PIC even prior to the approach to land. Heavy rainfall obscured the horizontal visibility of the pilots preventing a clear view of the runway.  - Absence of runway center lights. Environmental factor. Man-made Environment (Aerodrome) The PIC misconstrued the edge lights as the runway center lights. Low-visibility approaches require that these lights be present to help guide the pilots toward the runway center.  - Inadequate CRM procedures. Human factor. Psychological. (Training)  Standard and non-standard call-outs and responses are the hallmarks of an effective cockpit/CRM environment. There were lapses, omissions and contradictory words employed during the landing approach.  - Inadequate pilot re-currency training methods. Human Factor. Psychological. (Training)  Missed approach procedures during low-visibility non-precision approaches were seldom practiced during the re-currency training of the pilots. The over-use of baseline airports with runway center lights deprived the pilots the opportunity to hone their instrument flying skills in basic airports where they usually operate that has no center lights. - Lack of policy on the advisory role of air traffic controllers ( ATC ). Human Factor. Psychological. (Training)  During adverse weather conditions the ATC has no participation in the safety decisions which would require runway closure during critical aerodrome conditions especially in environmental conditions below runway visual minimaMETAR: 10:00 UTC / 18:00 local time: METAR RPMD 021000Z 14002 9999 TS BKN015 CB SCT090 BKN290 29/26 Q1008 CB SW-SE AND OVHD DIST PCPN NW LITS NWinds: 140 degrees at 2 knots; Visibility: 6 or more miles (10+ km); Ceiling: 1500 feet AGL; Clouds: broken clouds at 1500 feet AGL, scattered clouds at 9000 feet AGL, broken clouds at 29000 feet AGL; Thunderstorm; Temperature: 29Â°C; Dewpoint: 26Â°C; Pressure: 1008.0 mb.

He flew from Georgetown, Texas to Baton Rouge, Louisiana and dropped off two passengers there. The pilot elected to continue to McComb. The airplane departed runway 31 at Baton Rouge. Just after takeoff, the controller assigned the pilot a heading and altitude to McComb (MCB). The airplane turned northeast, on course, and reached an altitude of 1,200 feet. The radar track data then showed the airplane in a slow descent and slowing down; the airplane then disappeared from radar, prior to the accident site. The last radio transmission from the pilot was that he was going to crash. The airplane came down in a residential area at Rue Jennifer in the Baker suburb of Baton Rouge. The first impact point was the roof of one home. The airplane then impacted a tree and shed located in the backyard of neighboring homes. The airplane came to rest in an upright position, in the corner of two houses. A postcrash fire consumed most of the airplane; fire, smoke/water also damaged the two homes.

There were no injuries among the 30 passengers and three crew members. SOL LÃ­neas AÃ©reas flight 5420 was taxiing for takeoff at Mendoza-El Plumerillo Airport when the crew lost directional control of the aircraft. The airplane exited the taxiway and came to rest on rough terrain. Propeller blades of engine no. 1 were damaged, with shrapnel causing a 5 cm long hole in the fuselage. Aviation sources in Argentina reported in March 2013 that the airplane was considered damaged beyond economical repair. Conclusions: (translated from Spanish) While taxiing to the holding point of the runway in use, the crew of flight 8R5420 lost directional control and departed the taxiway, which resulted in the impact of the aircraft with objects on the ground. This was due to a combination of the following factors: - The electric pump which controls fluid pressure in the hydraulic system was not operational, generating a deficit of fluid pressure in the hydraulic system. - The low fluid pressure warning in the hydraulic system was not recognized by the crew. - The crew could not control the path of the aircraft due to the unavailability of nose wheel steering. - The persistence of an informal practice among the crews of the operator on the operation of the hydraulic system, contrary to the concept of operation of the hydraulic system established by the manufacturer. - The lack of detection of the informal practice on the operation of the hydraulic system by the operator's safety monitoring mechanisms.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JIAAC Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: JIAAC  Susto en Mendoza: se despistÃ³ un aviÃ³n de Sol (Perfil.com, 2-1-2013)   Location  Images: photo (c) Gustavo Lepez; Mendoza-El Plumerillo Airport, MD (MDZ/SAME); February 2013 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Flight DV760 operated on a domestic flight from Kokshetau Airport (KOV) to Almaty (ALA). Weather forecast obtained by the crew before departure showed a visibility of 800 m at Almaty with a vertical visibility of 90 m, and temporary reduced visibility to 200 meters. The flight took off at 11:19 hours local time. The captain was Pilot Flying. At 12:00 the flight contacted Almaty Control and received the current weather conditions which showed a limited visibility for runway 23R of 200 m. At 12:40 the flight was cleared to descend to FL80. By then visibility had decreased to 175 m. The captain decided to continue descent and prepare for an approach to decision height. The captain became increasingly stressed by the poor weather conditions. After reaching FL80 the crew were told to remain at that altitude because of another flight in the area. This provoked a strong emotional reaction from the captain. At 12:57 the flight was then cleared down to 1600 m. During the descent the lack of improvement of weather conditions caused a greater and greater irritation on the part of the captain. When turning to finals the runway visual range (RVR) for the first, mid and last part of runway 23R was reported as 275-250-225 m in freezing fog with a vertical visibility of 40 meters. With continuing visibility updates the flight crew kept descending until it was clear that a landing was impossible given the lack of visual contact with the ground. A missed approach was initiated at 13:10 from a height of 180 m. The autopilot was disconnected and the TO/GA button was pushed. Engine power increased and the flaps were raised to 8Â°. In the four seconds after pressing to TO/GA button there were no control inputs. Then the captain pushed the control column forward, causing the aircraft to descend. The EGPWS warning sounded as the pitch changed to -9. The observer pilot tried to draw attention on the EGPWS warning but there was no response on the controls by the flight crew. Pitch angle further increased to -16Â° and vertical speed was -20 to -30 m/sec. The aircraft impacted the ground at high speed and a -20Â° pitch angle and broke up. CONCLUSION: (translated from Russian): The accident with aircraft CRJ-200 UP-CJ006 occurred during the execution of a go-around, in instrument meteorological conditions, without the possibility of visual contact with ground reference points (vertical visibility in the fog did not exceed 40 m), the necessity of which was caused by the mismatch between the actual weather conditions and the minimum conditions for which the crew was certified to land. As a result, the deflection of the elevator towards a dive of the aircraft caused a descent and collision with the ground. It was not possible to uniquely identify the causes of the aircraft's transfer to a dive from the available data. The Commission did not find evidence of failures of aviation equipment, as well as external to the aircraft (icing, wind shear, wake turbulence) when trying to perform a go-around.  The most likely factors that led to the accident, were:   - partial loss performance of the pilot in command, which at the time of aircraft impact with the ground was not in a working position;   - the lack of CRM levels in the crew, and violation of the Fly-Navigate-Communicate principle, which manifested itself in diverting attention by the co-pilot to conduct external radio communication and lack of control of the flight instrument parameters;   - the lack of response to the EGPWS and the actions required;   - the impact somatographic illusions of perception of the pitch angle (a nose-up illusion);   - increased emotional stress by the crew members associated with the unjustified expectations of improved weather conditions at the time of landing;   - failure to comply with the requirements for health examination of flight personnel, which led to the pilot in command flying without the rehabilitation period and without assessment of his health status after undergoing surgery.METAR: 07:00 UTC / 13:00 local time: UAAA 290700Z 05001MPS 0150 R23R/0150N R23L/0200N FZFG VV001 M01/M01 Q1019 882/0150 NOSIG RMK QBB040Wind 050 degrees at 1 m/sec (2 knots); Visibility: 150 m; Runway Visual Range of runway 23R: 150 m, and 200 m at runway 23L; Freezing fog; Temperature: -1Â°C; Dewpoint: -1Â°C; Pressure: 1019 mb.07:30 UTC / 13:30 local time: UAAA 290730Z 02001MPS 0150 R23R/0150N R23L/0200N FZFG VV001 M01/M01 Q1018 882/0150 NOSIG RMK QBB040Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: Interfax  Prosecutor General's office of Republic of Kazakhstan  Ministry of Transport   Location  Images: photo (c) MAK; Almaty Airport (ALA); January 2013 photo (c) MAK; Almaty Airport (ALA); January 2013 photo (c) MAK; Almaty Airport (ALA); January 2013 photo (c) MAK; Almaty Airport (ALA); January 2013 photo (c) MAK; Almaty Airport (ALA); January 2013 photo (c) MAK; Almaty Airport (ALA); January 2013 photo (c) MAK; Almaty Airport (ALA); January 2013 photo (c) MAK; Almaty Airport (ALA); January 2013 photo (c) MAK; Almaty Airport (ALA); January 2013 photo (c) MAK; Almaty Airport (ALA); January 2013 photo (c) MAK; Almaty Airport (ALA); January 2013 photo (c) MAK; Almaty Airport (ALA); January 2013 photo (c) Alexander Zaleski; Almaty Airport (ALA); 07 January 2013; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) Vaclav Kudela; Praha-Ruzyne International Airport (PRG/LKPR); 30 January 2010 photo (c) Harro Ranter / ASN; Helsinki-Vantaa Airport (HEL/EFHK); 10 September 2001 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates02-Jan-2025 09:03 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Of the 50 occupants, five sustained serious injuries. Alitalia flight 1670 had departed Pisa-Galileo Galilei Airport (PSA) on a domestic flight to Roma-Fiumicino Airport (FCO). This flight was operated by Carpatair on behalf of Alitalia.  The airplane flew the approach in strong cross wind conditions with wind shear reported at runway 16L some fifteen minutes before the landing. Shortly before touchdown the airplane suddenly lost altitude and impacted the runway with the nose landing gear. This was at a distance of 567 meters from the runway threshold. It bounced three times, causing the nose and main gear to collapse. The airplane slid off the left side of the runway and came to rest in the grass near taxiway DE, at a distance of about 1780 meters from the runway threshold. The aircraft had also performed a rotation on the vertical axis of 170Â°, thus assuming a definitive orientation of about 330Â° magnetic. It came to rest 400 m from fire station no. 1. However, it took the fire services ten minutes to reach the airplane because they were not aware of the precise location of the accident. The airplane landed in strong winds from 250 degrees on runway 16L. Runway 25 at Fiumicino was Notamed not available for landings due to work in progress. The Fiumicino Notam reported at the time of the accident of the following limitations of the runway 16L ILS: - LOCALIZER AT 17NM MRA 3000FT AND AT 25NM MRA 4000FT - GLIDE PATH COVERAGE REDUCED AT 8.5NM The ATR 72-212 has a demonstrated maximum crosswind component of 35 kts on a dry runway. CAUSES: (translated from Italian) The accident is due to the human factor. In particular, it was caused by an improper conduct of the aircraft by the PF (commander) during landing, not consistent with the provisions of the operator's manuals, in an environmental context characterized by the presence of significant criticality (presence of crosswind with values at the limit/excess those allowed for the ATR 72) and in the absence of an effective CRM. The following factors may have contributed to the event. - The failure to carry out the landing briefing, which, in addition to being required by company regulations, would have been an important moment of pooling and acceptance of information fundamental to the safety of operations. - The maintenance of a V APP significantly higher than expected. - The conviction of the commander (PF), deriving from his considerable general and specific experience on the aircraft in question, to be able to conduct a safe landing in spite of the presence of critical wind conditions for the type of aircraft. - The considerable difference in experience between the commander and the first officer, which has reasonably prevented the latter from showing his critical capacity, thus rendering CRM techniques ineffective. After the accident, the application of the PEA revealed some critical issues, which did not allow to carry out in a timely and effective manner the search and rescue of the aircraft and its occupants.METAR: 19:20 UTC / 20:20 local time: LIRF 021920Z 25028G41KT 9999 SCT023 SCT040 11/04 Q0992 WS RWY 16L NOSIGWind 250 degrees at 28 knots, gusting to 41 knots; Visibility: 10+ km; Scattered clouds at 2200 feet AGL and 4000 feet AGL; Temperature: 11Â°C; Dewpoint: 4Â°C; Pressure: 992 mb; Windshear at runway 16L19:50 UTC / 20:50 local time: LIRF 021950Z 25023KT 9999 SCT023 SCT040 11/03 Q0992 NOSIG20:20 UTC / 21:20 local time: LIRF 022020Z 25022G32KT 9999 SCT022 BKN040 11/03 Q0992 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: ANSV Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Repubblica  BEA   Location  Images: photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Nassau International Airport (NAS/MYNN); 04 April 2002 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The commission investigating the crash concluded that the cause of this accident was a loss of speed by the aircraft during approach due to an error of an unprepared crew, which had not been allowed to make the flight in those weather conditions.METAR: 16:00 UTC / 18:00 local time: UKCC 131600Z 07002MPS 030V090 0250 R08/0750N FG VV001 01/01 Q1026 08290055 BECMG 0200 FG VV001Wind 2m/sec at 070 degrees, varying from 30 to 90 degrees; Visibility: 250 m (820 ft); Runway visual range at runway 08: 750 m (2460 ft); Fog; indefinite ceiling with vertical visibility of 100 feet AGL; Temperature: 1Â°C; Dew point: 1Â°C; Pressure : 1026 mb; Visibility becoming 200 m in fog with a vertical visibility of 100 feet AGL16:30 UTC / 18:30 local time: UKCC 131630Z 00000MPS 0500 R08/1300VP2000D PRFG VV002 01/01 Q1026 08290055 BECMG 0200 FG VV00117:00 UTC / 19:00 local time: UKCC 131700Z 00000MPS 0250 R08/0750N PRFG VV002 01/01 Q1026 08290055 BECMG 0200 FG VV001Visibility: 250 m (820 ft); Runway visual range at runway 08: 750 m (2460 ft); Partial fog; indefinite ceiling with vertical visibility of 200 feet AGL; Temperature: 1Â°C; Dew point: 1Â°C; Pressure : 1026 mb; Visibility becoming 200 m in fog with a vertical visibility of 100 feet AGL.17:30 UTC / 19:30 local time: UKCC 131730Z 00000MPS 0800 R08/0750V1800D PRFG VV001 01/01 Q1026 08290055 BECMG 0200 FG VV001Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NBAAI Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: RIA Novosti  URA-Inform  Interfax-Ukraine (10-4-2013)   Location  Images: photo (c) State Service of Emergency Ukraine; Donetsk Airport (DOK/UKCC); 13 February 2013 photo (c) State Service of Emergency Ukraine; Donetsk Airport (DOK/UKCC); 13 February 2013 photo (c) State Service of Emergency Ukraine; Donetsk Airport (DOK/UKCC); 13 February 2013 photo (c) State Service of Emergency Ukraine; Donetsk Airport (DOK/UKCC); 13 February 2013 photo (c) Volodymyr Moroz; Lvov-Snilow Airport (LWO/UKLL); 01 January 2013 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The copilot was Pilot Flying, the Pilot in Command (PIC) was Pilot Monitoring.  While en route at FL390 the flight crew listened out the ATIS frequency for Berlin-SchÃ¶nefeld, but they failed to hear any airport information. After commencing the descent, the flight was cleared for an ILS approach to runway 07L at Berlin-SchÃ¶nefeld. When passing FL200 in the descent, the Pilot Flying wanted to start the descent checklist, but the Pilot Monitoring wanted to fully listen out the ATIS which was now being received. The ATIS among others stated: ""[...] moderate icing reported below 3 000 feet [...]"". At 08:51 the Pilot Monitoring stated that the temperature was not below zero Celsius and that he wanted to wait before switching on the anti-ice systems. Four minutes later he switched on the Engine Anti-Ice System as temperature had dropped below zero. At 08:57 the flight was cleared to land on runway 07L. When working the Approach checklist, the Pilot Monitoring at the ""icing conditions"" item stated that ""it is still on"". The aircraft was subsequently configured for the final approach and the autopilot was disconnected. The PIC stated that they had visual contact with the runway and that 'everything could be switched off'. He proceeded to switch off the Engine Anti-Ice and Windshield Anti-Ice Systems. As the aircraft was flared over the threshold, the left wing dropped and contacted the runway. The aircraft then rolled right and touched down hard on the right hand main landing gear. The gear leg broke and the aircraft slid along the side of the runway until coming to a stop 447 meters past the runway threshold. A few minutes after the accident, officials noted that a 10 mm layer of ice had accumulated on the aircraft nose, wing leading edge, undercarriage and stabilizer. The PIC stated after the accident that he had not seen any ice accretion on the outer third of the wing and decided not to use the Wing and Horizontal Stabilizer De-Ice System. Activating this system would also have reduced aircraft performance. Causes (translated from German): The aircraft accident is attributable to the following causes: - The crew performed the approach under known icing conditions and did not switch on the Wing and Horizontal Stabilizer De-Ice System, contrary to the standard operating procedures (SOP). - During the flare the aircraft entered a stall due to ice build-up on the wings and tail unit and the fact that the speed fell below the approach speed prescribed for icing conditions, and fell off to the side. Contributing factor: - The crew had insufficient knowledge regarding the relationship between the Ice Protection System and the Stall Warning Protection System (SWPS).Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BFU Report number: BFU CX001-13 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 years and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: BFU CX001-13   Location  Images: photo (c) Jonathan Palombo; 12 March 2012; (CC:by) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The captain and the co-pilot survived. The remaining five occupants were killed. The airplane departed Nashville-John C. Tune Airport, TN about 18:27 CST on a flight to Thomson-McDuffie County Airport, GA.  According to the cockpit voice recorder (CVR), after the landing gear was lowered, about 20:04, the copilot noted that the ""ANTI SKID FAIL"" annunciator light illuminated. The pilot continued the approach, and, about 20:05, the airplane touched down on runway 10. The takeoff warning horn sounded about 0.3 seconds before the pilot stated that he was performing a go-around. The airplane lifted off near the departure end of the runway. The copilot directed the pilot to increase pitch. According to EGPWS data, as the airplane climbed to an altitude of about 63 ft (19 m) above the ground, about 9 seconds after liftoff, the left wing struck a utility pole located about 0.25 miles (400 m) east of the departure end of the runway.

There were 8 crew members and 117 passengers on board. The copilot was Pilot Flying.  After an uneventful flight of approximately two hours, the aircraft was established on ILS, for landing on runway 30 at Ponta Delgada Airport. Final approach was performed with both autopilots engaged in LAND mode and Auto Throttle engaged with SPEED mode selected. The aircraft was stabilized on glide slope and localizer, with an approach airspeed Vapp of 132 kts, for a Vref of 126 kts. Descending through 286ft (Radio Altimeter) the autopilots were disengaged. The aircraft was thereafter flown manually, assisted by the use of flight directors and autothrottle. Below 20 feet at a slightly high descent rate there was a short flare followed by a light bounce with spoilers extended. The ensuing aircraft's natural aerodynamic tendency was an increase in the pitch attitude in conjunction with a pulling force exerted on the control column with a high pitch rate (3Â°/s) and increasing high pitch up attitude (up to 14.82Â°). This manoeuvre, most likely to avoid a hard nose wheel ground contact, made the tail strike the ground. By the time the main landing gear shock absorbers were fully compressed the aircraftÂs pitch angle had exceeded the ground/ tail clearance of 13.2Â°. The aircraft was taxied to the apron and a maintenance preliminary check was performed. The aircraft had sustained serious damage to the underside of the rear fuselage, where the lower skin panels were abraded by contact with the runway surface. In some areas, the skin was buckled through its full thickness and some vertical struts bent the attachment area in the airframe structure. CAUSES OF THE ACCIDENT PRIMARY CAUSE Inadequate recovery handling of a bounced firm landing (deviation from recommended flying pilot technique). CONTRIBUTING FACTORS The following were considered as contributing factors: a) High sink rate prior to and during flare; b) Aircraft firm landing followed by a light bounce; c) Crew momentary unawareness of aircraft position (in the air) and intentional column pulling action, trying to smooth nose wheel contact with ground; d) The presence of a tailwind component during the flare phase above recommended 10kts limits; e) Aircraft's center of gravity at a slightly backward position but this factor is of marginal contribution only; f) The decision to land on damp runway 30, with tailwind component marginal to the maximum permitted (10kts), instead of a circling to land to the actual runway (12) in use or the decision to discontinue the approach via a go-around procedure; g) A bounce recovery at night (with less visual references) characterized by taking place very close to the ground (less than 20 feet) hence allowing for a very short reaction time from the PF and little control effectiveness of the aircraft (throttle retarded and normal configuration to land); h) The existing take-off / landing certification standards, which were based on the attainment of the landing reference speeds, and flight crew training that was based on the monitoring of and response to those speeds, hindering crew to detect degraded landing speed and sink rate.METAR: 20:30 UTC / 19:30 local time: LPPD 022030Z 15014KT 9999 -SHRA SCT016 14/12 Q099721:00 UTC / 20:00 local time: LPPD 022100Z 17013KT 9999 -SHRA SCT015 SCT030 13/12 Q0997Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: GPIAA Report number: 02/ACCID/2013 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane was parked on the platform at Annemasse Airport overnight. The temperature was -2Â°C and humidity was 98% with fog or low clouds as the pilot prepared for a 5-minute VFR flight to GenÃ¨ve-Cointrin Airport (GVA). The pilot started the takeoff from runway 12 at 08:38:18. Rotation occurred 19 seconds later. Several witnesses reported seeing the airplane with a high nose-up pitch attitude, with a low rate of climb. Three seconds after the rotation the ""Bank Angle"" warning, indicating excessive bank, and then the stall warning, was recorded several times on the CVR. Several witnesses saw the airplane turn sharply to the right and then to the left. Fifteen seconds after the rotation, the left main landing gear struck the roof of a house about 500 m from the threshold of runway 30 at Annemasse. The airplane then collided with the ground. During the impact sequence, all three elements in the landing gear and the left wing were torn away from the rest of the aeroplane. It then slid along the ground for a distance of about 100 m before hitting a garden shed, a low wall and some trees in the garden of a second house. The airplane caught fire and came to a stop. Causes of the Accident: ""The pilotÂs insufficient appreciation of the risks associated with ground-ice led him to take off with contamination of the critical airframe surfaces.

All nine on board were killed. The airplane was chartered by Minera AurÃ­fera Retamas SA (MARSA) to transport seven employees to a mining site. It took off from Lima at 06:25 hours local time, bound for Pias, Peru. After flying over the PÃ­as lagoon and seeing that the surrounding areas were covered by low clouds, especially the stretch from the beginning of the turn to the final leg of approach to the aerodrome, the crew chose to fly over the aerodrome in the opposite direction to the landing (140Â°). The flight then turned to the right and moved away on a course of approximately 170Â°, in order to make, a teardrop approach at low altitude and intercept the landing trajectory at heading 320Â°. While in landing configuration, the aircraft began a pronounced left turn at low altitude, approximately 4 km from the aerodrome, flying very close to the high and low voltage power lines installed parallel to the entrance ravine. The aircraft hit two cables of and subsequently impacted a slope of a ravine at 07:41 hours. A post-impact fire erupted. PROBABLE CAUSE: Loss of control of the aircraft due to impact with high-voltage cables, caused by the loss of visual references during approach to land at the PIAS aerodrome, in inappropriate weather conditions. CONTRIBUTOR FACTORS: Inadequate meteorological information provided by the PIAS aerodrome flight coordinator that did not reflect the actual weather condition of the area. Lack of a procedure card to carry out the descent, approach, landing and takeoff atPIAS, considering the visual and operational meteorological limitations in the area.

The aircraft was substantially damaged, and there were no injuries to the 148 occupants. Weather at the time of the event was reported as winds from 340 degrees at 6 knots, clear skies and 10 miles visibility. According to the flight crew, the preflight, departure and enroute segments of the flight were normal. The approach was flown with a Vref speed of 129 knots and 25 degrees of flap. Upon landing, the first officer called ""speedbrakes not activated"" and manually deployed the speedbrakes. The captain reported he felt the airplane ""float"" and attempted to maintain landing attitude. FDR data indicated that the airplane made an initial touchdown, followed by a brief gear squat switch deactivation, consistent with a slight bounce or light touchdown; the speedbrakes were then manually deployed. Airspeed decayed to approximately 115 knots and pitch attitude increased to about 11 degrees. The Delta 757/767 Flight Crew Training Manual specifies that contact with the runway is possible with pitch attitude greater than 10.5 degrees, with flaps 25 and airspeed of 10 knots below Vref. The airplane rolled out and taxied to the gate uneventfully. While preparing the aircraft for the next flight the flight crew was informed by maintenance personnel of damage to the tail section of the aircraft. Aircraft inspection revealed an 8 foot scrape on the lower aft fuselage, damage to several stringers and buckling of the aft pressurization dome.

Both crew members were not injured. Bin Air flight BID-3B originated in Manston International Airport, UK (MSE).  The aircraft was cleared to land on runway 10 at Dublin. The approach was a CAT 1 approach. Weather conditions at Dublin were poor with visibility approximately 1,100 metres and a cloudbase of approximately 300 ft. Dublin was operating in low visibility abeyance. Runway Visual Ranges (RVRs) at 08:28 hrs were 1,600 m at touchdown, 1,800 m at midpoint and 1.600 m at stopend. The aircraft broke out of cloud at about 650 ft, approximately 200 ft above the minimum for the CAT 1 approach, and the pilots could see three white Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) lights. As per normal procedure, after landing the First Officer who was Pilot Flying (PF) gave the controls to the captain who was Pilot Not Flying (PNF) so the he (PF) could complete the ""Leaving the Runway"" checklist. This checklist is completed from memory and included booster pump and flap-to-zero selections. The PNF recalled that during the landing roll, while the aircraft was braking and the indicated airspeed was below 90 kts, the nose gear suddenly collapsed. Both propellers contacted the runway surface and the aircraft quickly came to a halt resting on its nose. The Flight Crew then shutdown both engines, requested fire service assistance, selected batteries & generators to OFF and evacuated the aircraft through the cabin door. The Airport Fire Fighting personnel were on the scene within two minutes. There was no fire. The PF reported that it was a foggy day and that the approach was flown on limits with a lot of tension because of the uncertainty as to whether the aircraft would be able to land at Dublin. He described how concerns that fog might roll in raised his stress levels during the approach. During the landing roll, the landing gear selector was inadvertently moved to the UP position. This mistake was immediately recognised and the selector was returned to the DOWN position, but the nose-wheel retraction, which had been initiated, continued. The PF was unable to say definitively why the landing gear selector may have been mis-selected to UP, but he said that the intention may have been to move the Flap Selector instead. PROBABLE CAUSE: 1. Inadvertent selection of the landing gear selector to the UP position during the landing roll. CONTRIBUTORY CAUSES: 1. Reduced task focus by the PF following a tense and stressful limits approach. 2. Inactive landing gear interlock protection system due to the aircraft speed.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIU Report number: AAIU Report No. 2013-010 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) Timo Blossfeld; Hamburg-FuhlsbÃ¼ttel Airport (HAM/EDDH); 25 May 2008 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Both crew members were killed. The flight had originally departed Anchorage, AK (ANC) about 05:44, and made a scheduled stop at King Salmon, AK (AKN), before continuing on to the next scheduled stop, Dillingham, AK (DLG). As the airplane approached Dillingham, the flight crew requested the RNAV GPS 19 instrument approach to the Dillingham Airport about 07:57 from controllers at the Anchorage Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC). The ARTCC specialist on duty subsequently granted the request by issuing the clearance, with instructions to proceed direct to the Initial Approach Fix (IAF) to begin the approach, and to maintain an altitude of 2,000 feet or above. A short time later the flight crew requested to enter a holding pattern at the IAF so that they could contact the Flight Service Station (FSS) for a runway conditions report, and the ARTCC specialist granted that request. The ARTCC specialist then made several attempts to contact the aircraft, but was unsuccessful and subsequently lost radar track on the aircraft. An ELT signal indicated it had come down in the Muklung Hills. The wreckage was located the next day at an altitude of 2000 feet on the south side of the Muklung Hills. The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: The flight crew's failure to maintain terrain clearance, which resulted in controlled flight into terrain in instrument meteorological conditions. Contributing to the accident were the flight crew's failure to correctly read back and interpret clearance altitudes issued by the air traffic controller, their failure to adhere to minimum altitudes depicted on the published instrument approach chart, and their failure to adhere to company checklists.METAR: 16:45 UTC / 08:45 local time: PADL 081645Z 10017G30KT 7SM -RA OVC015 01/01 A2909Wind 100 degrees at 17 knots, gusting to 30 knots; Visibility: 7 miles; light rain; overcast cloud deck at 1500 feet AGL; Temperature: 1Â°C, dew point: 1Â°CAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ANC13FA030 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Anchorage Daily News   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; ca 32 km N of Dillingham, AK; March 2013; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; ca 32 km N of Dillingham, AK; March 2013; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; ca 32 km N of Dillingham, AK; March 2013; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; ca 32 km N of Dillingham, AK; March 2013; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; ca 32 km N of Dillingham, AK; March 2013; (publicdomain) photo (c) Timo Blossfeld; Anchorage-Ted Stevens International Airport, AK (ANC/PANC); 09 June 2011 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Two of the four persons on board were killed. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the business flight that departed Tulsa-Richard Lloyd Jones Jr. Airport, OK (RVS), at 13:58 CDT. According to preliminary air traffic control information, at 16:10, the accident pilot established radio communications with South Bend Approach Control while at 11,000 feet mean sea level (msl). The air traffic controller cleared the flight direct to KNUTE intersection and told the pilot to expect a visual approach to runway 9R. At 16:11, the flight was cleared to descend to 10,000 feet msl. At 16:13, the flight was cleared to 3,000 feet msl. At 16:15, the approach controller told the pilot to make a 5-degree left turn to align with runway 9R and asked the pilot to report when he had the airport in sight. At 16:15:07, the pilot declared an emergency because of a lack of engine power, reporting that they were ""dead stick"" and without any power. About 23 seconds later, at 16:15:30, the pilot transmitted ""we've lost all power, and we have no hydraulics."" When the controller asked if the airplane remained controllable, the pilot replied ""ah, barely controllable."" The controller advised that all runways at South Bend were available for landing and issued the current winds, which were 130-degrees at 10 knots. At 16:15:22, the pilot transmitted that the airplaneÂs navigational systems were inoperative and requested a radar vector toward the airport. The controller replied that the airport was 9 miles directly ahead of the airplane's current position. At 16:16:12, the controller told the pilot to turn 10-degrees left to intersect runway 9R. At 16:16:15, the pilot replied ""26DK, turning left."" No additional voice communications were received from the accident airplane. The approach controller continued to transmit radar vectors toward runway 9R without any response from the accident pilot. At 16:18:58, the approach controller told the accident airplane to go-around because the main landing gear was not extended. (The tower controller had informed the approach controller that only the nose landing gear was extended) The accident airplane was then observed to climb and enter a right traffic pattern for runway 9R. The airplane made another landing approach to runway 9R with only the nose landing gear extended. Several witnesses observed the airplane bounce several times on the runway before it ultimately entered a climbing right turn. The airplane was then observed to enter a nose low descent into a nearby residential community. The airplane came down in a street, crashing into a house near the 1600 block of N. Iowa Street, South Bend. The accident location is approx 1000 metres south of the end of runway 09R. Factual information released by the NTSB suggest that the pilot-rated passenger was allowed to fly the descent under supervision of the captain. The pilot-rated passenger had accumulated 1,576 hours in multi-engine airplanes and 301 hours in single-engine airplanes. He had no experience in turbine-powered business jets. During the descent the captain instructed the passenger to ""just pull the power out"" in order to slow the airplane down. Apparently the passenger lifted the pull-up locks on the throttles and retarded the throttles beyond flight idle, into the fuel cut-off position. The pilot told the pilot-rated-passenger ""you went back behind the stops and we lost power."" During the approach the pilot was able to restart engine number 1. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The private pilot's inadequate response to the dual engine shutdown during cruise descent, including his failure to adhere to procedures, which ultimately resulted in his failure to maintain airplane control during a single-engine go-around. An additional cause was the pilot's decision to allow the unqualified pilot-rated passenger to manipulate the airplane controls, which directly resulted in the inadvertent dual engine shutdown.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN13FA196 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years Download report:  Final report Sources: ADN.com  Flightaware  WSBT   Location  Images: photo (c) Mark Parren; near South Bend Regional, IN (SBN); 17 March 2013 photo (c) NTSB; near South Bend Regional, IN (SBN); 18 March 2013 photo (c) NTSB; near South Bend Regional, IN (SBN); 18 March 2013 photo (c) NTSB; near South Bend Regional, IN (SBN); 18 March 2013 photo (c) NTSB; near South Bend Regional, IN (SBN); 18 March 2013 photo (c) Walt Barkley; La Verne-Brackett Field, CA (POC/); 04 May 2012 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

One of the two crew members was killed. The airplane was flying to an agricultural field for a crop spraying flight on March 22 when it suffered a loss of engine power. A forced landing was carried out and it was established that the carburettor had failed. The carburettor was replaced and the engine was test run. On March 23 the airplane took off again. Shortly after takeoff the engine lost power. The pilot was forced to ditch the plane in a pond. The airplane flipped over and came to rest inverted in the pond. Probable cause (translated from Russian): The cause of the crash of the AN-2 RA-02203 was a nose-over during a forced landing on the water surface. The emergency landing was caused by falling power and auto shutdown of the engine in flight because of the destruction of the exhaust manifold header pipe and carburetor intake valve burnout with the further penetration of exhaust gas with high temperature in the carburetor of the engine input device. The destruction of the exhaust manifold header pipe, most probably originated on the mechanism of corrosion under tension in the heating of the material during operation of the engine on automobile gasoline. Power factor that led to the formation of an initial crack most probably were the residual stresses in the material production of origin, arising in the process of making the header pipe. According to the documentation the last overhaul of the manifold was made at 27.01.2009 at Shakhtinskiy RHA DOSAAF. Based on the submitted documents, the Commission has found no evidence of actual repairs on the manifold, as the marking on the only remaining tag indicates that the section was overhauled at plant No. 420GA in October 1983.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: State Emergency Ministry Krasnodar region  MAK Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC)   Location  Images: photo (c) State Emergency Ministry Krasnodar region; near Vostochnaya, Ust'-Labinsk Region; 23 March 2013 photo (c) MAK Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC); near Vostochnaya, Ust'-Labinsk Region; 24 March 2013 photo (c) MAK Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC); near Vostochnaya, Ust'-Labinsk Region; March 2013 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

On approach to runway 10, the captain and first officer discussed approach and landing considerations due to the strong crosswinds, and it was decided that the first officer would continue the approach. Immediately prior to landing, the first officer experienced difficulty, so control of the aircraft was transferred to the captain. The transfer of control was completed less than 2 seconds prior to landing. The aircraft touched down on the left main wheel, bounced, and landed hard on the nosewheel; the nose landing gear collapsed due to overstress failures. Directional control was lost, and the aircraft skidded on its nose and came to rest 96 feet off the north side of the runway. There were no injuries, and the aircraft was substantially damaged. The investigation determined that, when control of the aircraft was passed to the captain, there was insufficient time to position the aircraft for a successful landing due to the substantial crosswind. The Air Labrador Twin Otter standard operating procedures (SOPs) do not state when the captain should permit the first officer to act as pilot flying or relieve the first officer from that role. When allowing the first officer to fly in challenging conditions, the captain must be prepared to take control of the aircraft in adequate time to ensure the safety of the flight. Also, there is an increased risk of a landing accident if a required briefing is not conducted. Crew members may not share a common plan for the approach and landing, and, as in this case, transfer of control may not be conducted in a timely manner. Findings as to causes and contributing factors: 1. The captain permitted the first officer to continue with a challenging approach. 2. Control of the aircraft was passed to the captain with insufficient time to position the aircraft for a successful landing. 3. The aircraft landed hard, resulting in the collapse of the nose gear due to overstress failures. Findings as to risk: 1. If a required briefing is not conducted, the crew members may not share a common plan for the approach and landing, and the transfer of control may not be completed in a timely manner, increasing the risk of a landing accident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A13A0033 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were no injuries.  The airplane operated flight ML7817 from Dakar, Senegal to Lyon, France with an en route stop at Agadir, Morocco. The crew performed an ILS Category 1 (CAT I) approach to runway 36R. The weather conditions are such that operating low visibility procedures (LVP) prevailed. During the transition from the stabilization of height 1000 ft, the aircraft speed was 57 knots greater than the approach speed. At 140 feet, an inappropriate increase in thrust by autothrottles maintained the aircraft at a high speed. The aircraft landed long and the touched down 1600 meters after the 36R threshold. The plane overran at a speed of 75 knots and came to rest about 300 meters beyond the runway end. Causes of the Accident: Continuing an approach below the stabilisation height with a speed significantly higher than the approach speed shows that the crew were not adequately aware of the situation, even though they mentioned several times their doubts on the marginal meteorological conditions and on the difficulties in reducing the aeroplaneÂs speed. Continuing this unstabilised approach at an excessive approach speed triggered, below 150 ft, an uncommanded increase in engine thrust. The crewÂs delayed A/THR reduction below 20 ft made it impossible for the aeroplane to slow down sufficiently for about 15 seconds after passing the threshold. After descending through 20 ft, the copilotÂs inappropriate flare technique and the dual input phenomenon caused by the Captain significantly lengthened the flare phase. The remaining runway distance after the touchdown made it impossible for the aeroplane to stop before the end of the runway. The following factors contributed to continuing the unstabilised approach and the long flare: - a flight duty period of nearly 15 hours which likely led to crew fatigue; - incomplete preparation of the approach which meant the crew was not aware of the risks on the day (tailwind, wet runway); - the non-application of ATC procedures that require controllers to ensure aircraft are provided with localiser interception at the latest 10 NM from the runway threshold, with a maximum convergence of 30Â° and a maximum speed of 160 kt; - partial application of standard procedures (SOP), impaired task sharing and degraded CRM, which meant the crew was unable to manage optimally the aeroplaneÂs deceleration. These factors contributed to a progressive deterioration in situational awareness that meant that they could not envisage rejecting the approach and landing; - the A/THR anomaly which maintained the aeroplane at a high energy level during the landing phase; - an inadequate procedure for taking over the controls that led to the dual input phenomenon. The following organisational factors contributed to the crewÂs poor performance: - the choice of flight crew recruitment profiles by the operator, motivated by economic considerations, and inadequate airline conversion, led to operating aeroplanes with crews that were relatively inexperienced on type and in their roles as captain or copilot; - improper and inappropriate application of the regulatory provisions that allow an extension of flight duty time in case of ""unexpected circumstances"" without taking into account the predictable risk of excessive fatigue for the crew; - the absence of suitable initial oversight which made it impossible for the HCAA to focus on the predictable potential operational weaknesses of Hermes Airlines.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Report number: sx-s130329.en Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  2 February 2016 SX-BHS Daallo Airlines, lsf Hermes Airlines 1 near Mogadishu International Airport (MGQ) sub Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane incurred substantial damage and there were no injuries to the 192 occupants. The captain was the pilot flying and the first officer was the pilot monitoring. According to flight crew statements, the takeoff, climb, cruise and descent were uneventful. Prior to descent, the captain briefed a visual approach to runway 25L at LAS, which would be backed up by the instrument landing system (ILS). He also included a brief of the A321's 7.5 degree pitch limit. The crew reported that visual meteorological conditions with light and variable winds were initially reported at LAS, however, the winds (VMC) became gusty around the time of the accident. The captain stated that, once he turned off the autopilot while on the approach to runway 25L, he thought ""the winds seemed a little stronger..."" than what was reported, and it felt ""a little squirrelly"". According to the flight crew, the approach was stabilized, on speed, and on glide path. Flaps were selected FULL and autobrakes were selected LOW. The approach speed was 158 knots. When the captain began to initiate the flare within about 20 feet above the ground and pitched up ""just a tad"" for the flare, but stated he did not feel any pitch response, so he brought the nose up a little more to arrest the descent. Upon initial touchdown, he estimated that they bounced about 5-10 feet back into the air and the airplane struck its tail on the second touchdown.  Postaccident investigation revealed substantial damage to the underbelly and aft bulkhead area. The skin was abraded over a large area through its thickness in several areas of the pressure vessel . One frame was fractured along with several fractured shear ties and frame clips. Probable Cause: the captain's improper recovery from a bounced landing which resulted in a tailstrike.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA13FA071 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 7 years Download report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft had been in Lanseria Airport for a maintenance check. Prior to the planned flight, the aircraft underwent flight check for 45 minutes after completed planned maintenance on April 6th, flown by the Captain and another pilot. The aircraft departed FALA to FYOA for its first stop over with a flight time of 03:35h. The planned departure from FYOA was delayed due to trouble in starting the right engine. The aircraft took off at 10:21 hrs contrary to planned 08:30 hrs. For the second leg of the flight, the aircraft departed FYOA to FPST with a filed flight plan of 5 hours and 20 minutes (flight time) having FYOA as alternate. Leaving the Namibian airspace the pilot only contacted Luanda ATC and SÃ£o TomÃ© Tower as destination. At the time of the flight the west coast of Africa in the vicinity of Gulf of Guinea had widespread moderate to severe thunderstorm activity with lighting and heavy rain. When initiating descent to SÃ£o TomÃ© from FL 200 to 4000 feet as instructed by SÃ£o TomÃ© ATC, the pilot was advised that weather was gradually deteriorating at the airport. At 16:10 hrs the pilot had the last radio contact with SÃ£o TomÃ© Tower, informing them about his position which was 9 nm inbound to SÃ£o TomÃ© VOR at 4000 feet and also informed the ATC that he was encountering heavy rain. Having lost contact with the aircraft at 16:13 hrs, the SÃ£o TomÃ© ATC tried several times to contact the airplane  A Search and Rescue operation started on 7 April 2013 the same day the accident occurred and was conducted on the sea and on the island; no trace of aircraft or its debris, pilot or any cargo were found. The search was terminated on 20 April at 1730hrs. Probable Causal Factors By the fact that there is no evidence of the crash, the cause of the accident cannot be conclusively decided, however the investigation discovered series of discrepancies and non-compliance which includes: a. Pilot: i. Planned long flight as solo pilot from Lanseria to Bamako is excessive for pilot fatigue perspective (over 15 hours flying). ii. The First Class FAA (USA) medical Certificate issued on April 23rd 2012 had expired on October 31st 2012. b. Meteorological Conditions: i. Adverse weather conditions enroute and on arrival on that day, the west coast of Africa in the vicinity of Gulf of Guinea had widespread moderate to severe thunderstorm activity with lighting and heavy rain. When initiating descent to Sao Tome, the pilot was advised that weather was gradually deteriorating at airport vicinity.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CNIPAIA Report number: GT/07/04/2013/RF Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 years and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Angop  Small Plane With U.S. Pilot Missing Off West Africa (AP, 12-4-2013)   Location  Images: photo (c) via Werner Fischdick; Lanseria Airport (HLA/FALA); January 2004 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

While taking off after a touch-and-go landing, a takeoff configuration warning was generated. The commander rejected the takeoff and brought the aircraft to a halt on the remainder of the runway. The nose landing gear sustained some damage as the aircraft de-rotated on to the nosewheel during the manoeuvre. The crew did not consider the touchdown on the nose landing gear to be excessive and were not aware of the damage.  After a short delay, the training detail was continued. On the subsequent takeoff, with the co-pilot as PF, an ECAM message, l/g shock absorber fault was generated. This meant that the landing gear could not be retracted and that the autopilot and autothrust were unusable. During the climbout the aircraft started to descend so the commander took control and resumed the climb to circuit altitude.  After considering the status of the aircraft, the commander cancelled the training detail and the aircraft was diverted to a maintenance base. The available evidence suggested that the configuration warning resulted from the speed brake lever being inadvertently placed in the speed brake range, during the touch-and-go landing, in such a position that it did not command spoiler surface deflection. The timing of this selection indicated that it occurred when the ground spoilers were being disarmed by the commander pressing the lever downwards. This then caused the takeoff config warning to be activated after takeoff power was set, and the commander rejected the takeoff.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: EW/C2013/04/01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: 1. https://www.gov.uk/aaib-reports/airbus-a320-214-g-ozby-10-april-2013  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates11-Jul-2014 10:12 harro Added 18-Dec-2014 15:18 Dr. John Smith Updated [Date, Location, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Embed code, ]31-Oct-2024 07:55 ASN Updated [Other fatalities, Departure airport, Destination airport, Source, Narrative, ] Corrections or additions? ...

Flight JT-904 departed originated at Palu Airport (PLW), Indonesia and was bound for Denpasar (DPS), Indonesia with en route stops at Balikpapan Airport (BPN), Banjarmasin Airport (BDJ) and Bandung Airport (BDO). The flight departed Bandung at 13:45 with the copilot as Pilot Flying. About 15:00 the flight was descending towards Bali and the crew received vectors for a VOR DME approach for runway 09. At 15:08, with the aircraft at approximately 1,600 ft AGL, the Tower controller saw the aircraft on finals and gave a landing clearance with additional information that the wind condition was 120Â° at 5 kts. While descending through 900 feet the copilot stated that the runway was not in sight. Since the captain noted a flashing light at the beginning of the runway, he responded: ""OK. Approach light in sight, continue"". At 15:09:33, after the EGPWS called out ""Minimum"" at an altitude of approximately 550 ft AGL, the pilot disengaged the autopilot and the auto throttle and continued the descent. The airplane then entered an area of rainfall and the outside environment became totally dark. At 150 ft AGL the captain took over control. The copilot handed the control to the captain and stated that he could not see the runway. At 15:10:01, the EGPWS called out ""Twenty"", and the captain commanded a go around. One second later the aircraft impacted the water. The aircraft stopped facing to the north at about 20 meters from the shore or approximately 300 meters south west of the beginning runway 09. Contributing Factors: - The aircraft flight path became unstable below minimum descends altitude (MDA) with the rate of descend exceeding 1000 feet per minute and this situation was recognized by both pilots. - The flight crew loss of situational awareness in regards of visual references once the aircraft entered a rain cloud during the final approach below minimum descends altitude (MDA). - The PIC decision and execution to go-around was conducted at an altitude which was insufficient for the go-around to be executed successfully. - The pilots of accident aircraft was not provided with timely and accurate weather condition despite the weather around the airport and particularly on final approach to the airport was changing rapidly.METAR: 07:00 UTC / 15:00 local time: WADD 130700Z 09006KT 9999 BKN017 30/26 Q1007 NOSIG07:30 UTC / 15:30 local time: WADD 130730Z 15006KT 110V270 9999 FEW017CB SCT017 30/25 Q1007 NOSIGWind 150Â°, varying between 110 and 270Â° at 6 knots; unlimited visibility; few Cumulonimbus clouds at 1700 feet AGL; scattered clouds at 1700 feet AGL; Temperature: 30Â°C; Dewpoint: 25Â°C; Pressure: 1007 mb08:00 UTC / 16:00 local time: WADD 130800Z 10009KT 9999 FEW017CB SCT017 30/26 Q1007 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSC Report number: KNKT.13.04.09.04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) Leslie Snelleman; Jakarta-Soekarno-Hatta International Airport (CGK/WIII); 04 April 2013 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates09-Feb-2025 14:11 ASN Updated [Departure airport, Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The climb and cruise phases of the flight were uneventful. At 17:20, having descended to FL150, the captain, who was Pilot Flying, handed over controls to the first officer to enable him to manually fly the remainder of the descent until final approach although the first officer had voiced his concerns as he had not yet accumulated 100 hours on the A321 since his checkride.  The descent was continued as the airplane was positioned for an ILS approach to runway 16. At 17:34 the tower controller reported the ceiling at the airport to be 200 feet. At that time the captain took over control from the first officer and became Pilot Flying again. At minimums the captain reported seeing the runway and stated, ""continue, in sight."" The airspeed then decreased to below the planned Vapp of 138 knots. At 17:37 the airplane passed the threshold at 131 knots. The airplane touched down 155 meters past the threshold at a speed of 136 knots and a vertical gravity of 1,965 g. Pitch angle was 6.7Â° and touchdown occurred at an angle of attack of 15.5Â°. The aircraft bounced as thrust was increased, touching down again about 491 meters from the threshold. Pitch angle was 10.9Â° and the angle of attack was 23.2Â° with a vertical gravity of 1.715 g. The underside of the tail contacted the runway, causing substantial abrasion damage 100 cm wide and 600 cm long, including wear-through. Eleven interior frames were cracked. The Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board (ARAIB) determines that the causes of this accident were: 1) The pilot flying (PF) failed to maintain the proper approach speed until the flare just before touchdown, and the airplane bounced on touchdown since higher-than-normal vertical gravity was applied due to a high sink rate and increased thrust and speed just before touchdown; and 2) The airplane made a second touchdown at the pitch attitude exceeding an A321 airplane's limitation and sustained a tail strike since the PF failed to keep thrust at idle and establish the proper pitch attitude during the bounce.  Contributing to this accident were: 1) the inadequate training program dealing with the recovery form the bounce;  2) lack of pre-landing preparation due to a failure to conduct an approach briefing on pitch attitude;  3) the PF's failure to properly allocate his attention due to his delegation of flight control to the pilot monitoring (PM) who failed to meet flight control requirements;  4) the PM's inadequate advice and monitoring due to the PF's failure to make standard callouts;  5) the disconnection of the autothrottle and a failure to manually control thrust and speed; and  6) a failure to execute a go-around when stabilized approach criteria are not met.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: ARAIB Report number: ARAIB/AAR1303 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

At 14:58 AeromÃ©xico flight 002 took off from Madrid on a scheduled flight to Mexico City, Mexico. On board were three pilots, six flight attendants and 154 passengers. During takeoff the tail impacted runway 36L, causing substantial damage to the underside of the tail. While climbing to FL140 the cabin failed to pressurize as expected. Then the oxygen masks deployed in the cabin. At 15:20 the flight crew informed the controller at Madrid that they were returning due to pressurization problems. The airplane entered a holding pattern and landed safely on runway 18R at 16:25. Air Europa flight 71 to Caracas, Venezuela took off at 15:29 and suffered a punctured nose gear tyre, probably after running over debris left on the runway after the AÃ©romexico tailstrike. AEA71 was the seventh flight to take off from runway 36L following the AeromÃ©xico plane. The Airbus A330-200, EC-JPF, entered a holding pattern off the southern coast of Portugal at FL100 and landed safely back at Madrid at 19:39. Causes (translated from Spanish): The accident occurred because the aircraft rotated at a speed much lower than necessary because it had been incorrectly calculated during the dispatch, based on the weight of the aircraft with zero fuel (ZFW) instead of the takeoff weight of the aircraft (TOW). Then the error was not detected by the crew when entering data into the FMS. Contributing factors: - The On-Board Performance Tool (OPT) was recently introduced in the company. - The experience of both the dispatch officer as well as crew members was insufficient in this area. - The On-Board Performance Tool (OPT) was not installed at the Madrid station so that the transmission of the information was not performed according to procedures.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CIAIAC Report number: A-010/2013 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: CIAIAC   Location  Images: photo (c) Kentaro Iemoto; Tokyo-Narita Airport (NRT/RJAA); 16 July 2011; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane was based at Kandahar and operated by the US Air Force on a combat intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) mission. The airplane, callsign Independence 08, departed Kandahar at 11:57 and entered orbit at 12:29. Upon entering the operating area about 12:29, they encountered a cloud deck partially covering their orbit area and a large, rapidly building towering cumulous cloud in the center of their orbit area from 17,000 ft to 24,000 ft mean sea level (MSL). The towering cumulus clouds began to grow and drift into the airplane's orbit, prompting a request to climb from 20,000 ft to 23,000 ft. This translates to climbing from 13,800 to 16,800 ft above ground level. The airplane was in a left hand orbit, preparing to shift the orbit, when the pilot initiated the climb with the autopilot on at 12:40:40. While or just after initiating the climb, the pilot continued working an orbit adjustment to better service tracking an active target, and approximately ten seconds after the climb was initiated, the climb rate increased. Fifteen seconds afterward the pilot noticed he had allowed the airspeed to decrease during the climb, stating, ""A little slow, correcting."" Seven seconds later, the mission commander in the right hand seat said, ""Alright, firewall,"" meaning to advance the throttles as far forward as they would go, and one second later, the auto-pilot was disengaged. The propellers on the MC-12W do not counter-rotate, and advancing the power in the MC-12W produces left-handed torque and P-factor, creating a left yaw and making the aircraft to want to turn left; the airplane was already in a left-hand turn and left bank. Two seconds after calling to ""firewall"" the throttles, and one second after auto-pilot disengagement, the bank angle warning tone sounded, indicating the left bank had rapidly increased to greater than 50 degrees. The mission commander again called for full power, and four seconds later, he directed ""eyes inside,"" telling the pilot to refer to his instruments for attitude and airspeed information; contemporaneously, the stall warning sounded. The stall warning horn stopped after five seconds, and a second later, background noise indicates items began flying around within the cockpit and the bank angle warning stopped. The pilot stated: ""Whoa, pull up"". The mission commander then advised the pilot to look at his airspeed and took over the aircraft, calling for a reduction in power. Four seconds after the mission commander took the aircraft, the aircraft overspeed warning sounded, followed by the landing gear horn sounding. The landing gear horn indicates the throttles were reduced toward idle, and it did not sound until 15 seconds after initial stall warning sounded. The MA reached a maximum recorded height of 20,900 ft. and lost approximately 15,000 ft before impacting the ground. The airplane impacted with the fuselage slightly nose-low, in a left bank, with minimal forward momentum. The airplane was destroyed upon impact and burned during the post-crash fire . CONCLUSION: ""I find by clear and convincing evidence the cause of the mishap was a stall due to insufficient airspeed, while in a climbing left turn, which developed into a left spin followed quickly by a high-speed spiral, from which the crew was unable to recover. Additionally, I find, by a preponderance of evidence, each of the following three factors substantially contributed to the  mishap: (1) orbit weather that impeded visibility and masked the horizon; (2) pilot inexperience in the MC-12W; and (3) known MC-12W program risks associated with sustaining required combat capability in theater.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: USAF AIB Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Army Times   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

All seven crew members were killed in the accident. The accident flight was operated as part of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) to transport military equipment. The original schedule was for the crew to operate flight NCR510 from Chateauroux, France to Camp Bastion, Afghanistan, and then continue to the Dubai World Center at Al Aktoum, UAE. Because no Pakistan over-flight permit was obtained, the flight was re-routed as NCR102 to operate from Camp Bastion to Bagram, refuel, and continue NCR102 from Bagram to Dubai.  According to the load manifest, while in Camp Bastion, the airplane was loaded by National Air Cargo ground personnel with 94,119 kg of cargo, including 5 Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) armored military vehicles that were loaded on the main deck of the airplane. Two of these vehicles weighed about 12 tons each, and the other three weighed about 18 tons each. It was the first time National Airlines had transported 18-ton military vehicles when they were loaded on the accident airplane in Camp Bastion. The airplane departed Camp Bastion at 07:45Z and arrived into Bagram at 09:23Z (13:53 local time). On arrival into Bagram, the crew experienced a brake overheat condition after landing on runway 03. The crew parked the airplane on the Foxtrot ramp and ran a checklist to address the brake temperature indications in the cockpit, and discussed the required cooling time of 1 to 1.5 hours.  The crew did not take on any additional cargo in Bagram, and only took on fuel for the flight to Dubai.  At about 14:27 hours local time while the airplane was still on the ramp in Bagram, the captain was made aware of a broken strap found by one of the other crewmembers, and the cockpit crew had a discussion about a possible shift of the cargo load during landing in Bagram. There was additional discussion on re-securing the load prior to departure. Flight NCR102 taxied out normally for departure on runway 03 at Bagram at 15:14. After receiving clearance, takeoff was commenced at 15:26. The takeoff roll appeared normal. The airplane rotated normally around the Charlie intersection of the runway. Approximately 9 seconds after the crew called to rotate the airplane, the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) stopped recording, and approximately 3 seconds later the flight data recorder (FDR) stopped recording. According to witnesses and video evidence, after becoming airborne, the airplane continued to pitch up until it appeared to stall, turn to the right, then descended to impact with the ground just beyond the departure end of runway 03 and to the right.  An investigation of the wreckage revealed at least the aft-most MRAP broke loose of its restraints during takeoff, shifted aft and damaged the FDR/CVR before penetrating the aft pressure bulkhead. The MRAPÂs aft movement was determined to have compromised at least Hydraulic Systems #1 and #2 and may have contacted the stabilizer jackscrew assembly. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""National AirlinesÂ inadequate procedures for restraining special cargo loads, which resulted in the loadmasterÂs improper restraint of the cargo, which moved aft and damaged hydraulic systems Nos. 1 and 2 and horizontal stabilizer drive mechanism components, rendering the airplane uncontrollable. Contributing to the accident was the Federal Aviation AdministrationÂs inadequate oversight of National AirlinesÂ handling of special cargo loads.""METAR: 09:55 UTC / 14:25 local time: KQSA 290955Z COR 10017G30KT 9999 SCT085 BKN140 BKN200 17/06 A2992 RMK PK WND 09032/0856 LTG DSNT NW CB DSNT E SLP213 WND DATA ESTMD ALSTG/SLP ESTMD COR 1310:55 UTC / 15:25 local time: KQSA 291055Z 02007KT 9999 FEW040 BKN080CB BKN150 18/06 A2994 RMK PK WND 06026/1005 WSHFT 1027 LTG DSNT NW CB DSNT NW SLP124 WND DATA ESTMD ALSTG/SLP ESTMD10:58 UTC / 15:28 local time: KQSA 291058Z 35011G17KT 9999 FEW050 BKN080CB BKN150 14/05 A2993 RMK LTG DSNT NW SLP124 WND DATA ESTMD ALSTG/SLP ESTMD10:59 UTC / 15:29 local time: KQSA 291059Z 35011G17KT 9999 FEW050 BKN065 BKN090 14/05 A2993 RMK WND DATA ESTMD ALSTG/SLP ESTMD11:55 UTC / 16:25 local time: KQSA 291155Z 33008G17KT 9999 -TSRA SCT050CB BKN090 BKN170 13/04 A2996 RMK CB OHD MOV N SLP139 60000 70000 51014Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NTSB/AAR-15-01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Wall Street Journal  NTSB  National Airlines  SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Bagram Air Base (BPM/OAIX); 2014; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Bagram Air Base (BPM/OAIX); 2014; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; 2014; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; 2014; (publicdomain) photo (c) A1C Sarah Lipfird, USAF; Camp Bastion; 29 April 2014; (publicdomain) photo (c) Paul Nelhams; Shannon Airport (SNN/EINN); 16 August 2012; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) VÃ¡clav Kudela; Praha-Ruzyne International Airport (PRG/LKPR); 02 February 2013 photo (c) VÃ¡clav Kudela; Praha-Ruzyne International Airport (PRG/LKPR); 02 February 2013 photo (c) Jiri Starek; Praha-Ruzyne International Airport (PRG/LKPR) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Upon takeoff, a flight control system malfunction, the board found, generated directional instability, causing the aircraft's nose to slowly drift from side-to-side or ""rudder-hunt."" This condition, not fully diagnosed by the crew, progressed into a more dangerous oscillatory instability known as a ""Dutch roll."" The board identified that a poor layout of key information in the inflight manual and insufficient crew training contributed to the mishap by detracting from the crew's ability to act on critical information during their troubleshooting to turn off either of two cockpit switches which may have eliminated the malfunction. Having not recognized the Dutch roll condition, the crew initiated a left turn to remain on-course along the planned route of flight and used a small amount of left rudder to coordinate the turn. The use of rudder, while in a Dutch roll, increased the aircraft's oscillatory instability. The ensuing large side-to-side movements of the aircraft varied the crew member's foot pressure on the rudder pedal which caused inadvertent fluctuations in rudder position. These fluctuating rudder movements, coupled with slight right rudder use while rolling out of the turn, compounded the Dutch roll severity and produced extreme airframe stress that caused the KC-135's tail section to separate from the aircraft. The subsequent, uncontrollable descent resulted in an in-flight explosion.Sources: Air Mobility Command Public Affairs  Kloop.kg 3-5-2013  CNN 3-5-2013   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

During the en-route phase at cruising level, a diversion was made to circumnavigate a cloud formation with high vertical development and the descent was initiated later than planned.  The flight crew was cleared for an instrument approach, but carried out a missed approach because the runway was not in sight. Authorization was requested to change to visual flight rules, which was approved by the controller. The flight crew then initiated a visual approach by flying a short base leg, ending with a small radius turn to align with the runway. During this turn, the crew neglected to control and monitor the airspeed because the captain was looking for the runway and the first officer was reviewing the procedures according to the checklist. The aircraft stalled and lost altitude, striking a house in a residential area about 1 nautical mile from the threshold of runway 10. The accident resulted in the complete destruction of the aircraft, a house, part of two other houses, seven vehicles and a perimeter wall of the area where it fell. The probable cause was not operating the aircraft according to the procedures and parameters established by the manufacturer, in addition to the lack of situational awareness of the captain and the first officer and the failure to comply with briefings in all phases of flight operation, focused on activities that were not related to the conduct of the flight. The physical factor is considered as a contributing factor as bad weather conditions added difficulty to the flight.METAR: 13:00 UTC /  local time: METAR SVVA 051300Z 14006KT 0100 +TSSH FEW013CB OVC016 21/20 Q101614:00 UTC /  local time: METAR SVVA 051400Z 02004KT 1000 +TSRA FEW013CB OVC016 21/20 Q1017Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JIAAC Venezuela Report number: 011/2013 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: Noticias 24  El Universal   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft sustained substantial damage and the three passengers onboard were not injured. The airplane had just undergone a flight management system (FMS) upgrade at a maintenance facility in Grand Junction, and this was both its first flight, and its home base return flight, following the upgrade. The pilot reported that the flight and landing approach were uneventful. As the airplane touched down on runway 22, the pilot deployed the spoilers, and then pulled the power levers to the thrust reverser detent position; however, the deploy indicators did not illuminate. He then recycled the thrust levers back into the detent, but again the reversers did not deploy. Both the pilot and copilot attempted to troubleshoot as the airplane continued along the runway. The pilot then applied pressure to the foot pedal brakes, but did not feel a response; the copilot also attempted, but reported that the pedals felt loose and the airplane did not slow down. As the airplane approached the threshold, the pilot engaged the steering lock switch, and attempted to steer the nose wheel, but the airplane did not respond. Just prior to reaching the runway end, he activated the emergency braking lever; however, the airplane rolled off the runway end, through a set of instrument landing system antennas, and down an embankment. Subsequent examination revealed that the mounting screws for both the left and right main landing gear squat switches were loose, such that the switches had backed away from their mounting pads. The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be: Failure of maintenance personnel to reattach the landing gear squat switches following maintenance, which rendered the airplane's steering, braking, and thrust reverser systems inoperative during landing. Contributing to the accident were the failure of both the maintenance facility mechanics and the airplane operator's mechanic and flight crew to identify the error during post maintenance checks, a failure of the airplane's pilot to apply the emergency brakes in a timely manner, and the copilot's decision to attempt to engage the thrust reversers as the airplane approached the runway end despite multiple indications that they were inoperative and producing partial forward, rather than reverse, thrust.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: WPR13FA227 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; McMinnville Municipal Airport, OR; May 2013; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; McMinnville Municipal Airport, OR; May 2013; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Two crew members and one passenger sustained serious injuries. The airplane departed Pokhara Airport (PKR) at 08:10 on a domestic flight to Jomsom. While descending towards the destination airport, the Jomsom controller reported that there was a south-westerly 8-12 knot wind with runway 24 in use. During the approach the pilot in command took over the communication function of the copilot and contacted Jomsom Tower, requesting to use runway 06 instead of runway 24, despite the advice of the tower controller to use runway 24 to avoid tail wind effect in runway 06.  The tailwind component, exceeded the five knot tailwind limit stipulated in the companyÂs standard operating procedure. The airplane touched down 776 feet past the threshold of the 2,424-foot-long runway 06. It covered a distance of 194 feet on the airstrip and veered towards the grassland.  During the landing roll, when the aircraft was decelerating, the co-pilot had raised the flaps as per the existing practice of carrying out the after the landing checks."" The pilot in command added power to re-enter the runway. After running 705 feet on the grassland the airplane entered the runway again. Without making his intentions clear to the copilot, the pilot in command continued adding power for go around.  The accelerating aircraft gained insufficient speed and lift to take off and ran out of the runway 24 end, continued towards the river, hit the barbed fence and gabion wall with an initial impact and finally fell down onto the banks of Kaligandaki River. The most probable cause of the accident is the inappropriate conduct of STOL procedure and landing technique carried out by the PIC, during the landing-phase and an endeavour to carry out take off again with no sufficient airspeed, no required lifting force and non availability of required runway length to roll. Contributory factors to the occurrence is the absence of proper CRM in terms of communication, coordination and briefing in between crew members on intention and action being taken by PIC during pre and post landing phase.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: Nepal AAIC Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: eKantipur  Hemant Arjyal  The Himalayan Times History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  16 October 2011 9N-ABO Nepal Airlines, opf Tara Air 0 Lukla Airport - VNLK min Taxiway excursion Location  Images: photo (c) pm subedi; Jomsom Airport (JMO/VNJS); 16 May 2013 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The four occupants of the aircraft were uninjured in the accident.  The approach to Campo de Marte was flown at VRef +10 kt, a little higher than recommended by the manufacturer. Also, the airplane was near its maximum landing weight.  The aircraft touched down on runway 12 at a position approximately 1000 m from the runway threshold. Some 900 m were necessary for landing, but the remaining runway distance was about 300 m. The inexperienced pilot (10 hours on type) attempted to use the emergency braking system, but pulled the wrong handle. He accidently raised the undercarriage. The airplane slid off the left side of the runway and came to rest in the grass. Contributing factors (translated from Portuguese): Concerning the operation of the aircraft  a) Application of commands - contributed  The final approach at a speed higher than anticipated, the touchdown at 1,000 meters from the runway threshold and the braking action without using the pedals show the inadequate use of controls of the aircraft.  b) Cockpit coordination - unspecified  There may not have been a proper cockpit coordination between the commander and his copilot. The distribution of tasks, accurate communication and consultation with the manufacturer's manuals could have prevented the accident.  c) Education - unspecified  It is possible that the captain did not receive adequate training in the operation of the aircraft, but it was not possible to prove the fact that the commander did not receive instruction.  d) Piloting judgement - contributed  There was no adequate judgement of the crew when it was decided to conduct an approach at a speed higher than recommended by the manufacturer and the touch down beyond the first third runway available.  e) Planning of flight - contributed  The weight of the aircraft to near maximum landing weight demanded increasing distance required for landing.  f) Low pilot experience - unspecified  Limited experience of the pilot in jet aircraft may have contributed to the occurrence. A better understanding into the aerodynamics, using graphics charts to calculate speeds and distances required for landing and simulator training could have been barriers to prevent this accident.  g) Management Oversight - unspecified  The lack of records of hours flown and inspections for a long period of time, demonstrate inadequate supervision of the responsible operation.  However, it was not proven that there was some sort of mechanical failure that could impair the braking system of the aircraft.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: CENIPA Report number: A-097/CENIPA/2013 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) RenÃ© Ballo; Assis Airport, SP (AIF/SBAS); 1998 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were no injuries. The C-130, assigned to the 41st Airlift Squadron, 19th Airlift Wing, was conducting a medical evacuation when the accident occurred. The accident happened on the third of five planned legs that day to an airfield that was at 6,809 feet Mean Sea Level (MSL) and experiencing winds varying from 200 to 250 degrees gusting from 6 to 28 knots. On the second attempted landing, the aircraft touched down approximately 1,500 ft down the runway but was 27 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS) faster than computed touchdown landing speed leading to the aircraft going off the end of the runway at approximately 49 KIAS. It struck a ditch which collapsed the nose gear and eventually ripped the right main landing gear from the fuselage. The right outboard engine struck the ground, pressurized fuel and oil lines were broken, fluid was sprayed over the cracked engine casing, and the right wing caught fire. The aircraft came to a full stop at approximately 544 feet off the end of the paved runway surface. The Accident Investigation Board (AIB) president found, by clear and convincing evidence, that the causes of the accident were poor Crew Resource Management (CRM) and mishap pilot one's (MP1) late power reduction causing a 27 KIAS fast touchdown at a high altitude airfield (6,809 ft MSL). Additionally, the AIB President found by the preponderance of evidence that each of the following factors substantially contributed to the mishap: 1) Channelized Attention; 2) Risk Assessment; 3) Delayed Necessary Action; 4) Response Set; 5) Procedural Error.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: USAF AIB Report number: Executive summary report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Stars and Stripes 20-5-2013  Damn, this Afghan Airstrip Practically Eats American Planes (Medium.com 12-6-2013)   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

British Airways flight BA762 departed runway 27L on a scheduled service to Oslo, Norway. At that moment, the fan cowl doors from both engines detached, puncturing a fuel pipe on the right engine and damaging the airframe. The symptoms seen by the flight crew included: engine thrust control degradation, the loss of the yellow hydraulic system, and a significant fuel leak. After the loss of the yellow hydraulic system the crew declared a PAN, with the intention of returning to Heathrow once they had fully assessed the situation. ATC provided radar vectors for the ILS to runway 27R. During the approach to land, an external fire developed on the right engine. An engine fire warning on the flight deck prompted the crew to declare a MAYDAY.  Although both engine fire extinguisher bottles were discharged and the right engine was shut down, the fire was not completely extinguished. The left engine continued to perform normally throughout the flight. The aircraft landed safely and was brought to a stop on runway 27R at Heathrow. The airport fire service attended and quickly extinguished a small fire on the right engine. The passengers and crew evacuated via the escape slides on the left side of the aircraft, without injury. Causal factors The investigation identified the following causal factors: 1. The technicians responsible for servicing the aircraftÂs IDGs did not comply with the applicable AMM procedures, with the result that the fan cowl doors were left in an unlatched and unsafe condition following overnight maintenance. 2. The  pre-departure  walk-around  inspections  by  both  the pushback tug driver and the co-pilot did not identify that the fan cowl doors on both engines were unlatched. Contributory factors The investigation identified the following contributory factors: 1. The design of the fan cowl door latching system, in which the latches are positioned at the bottom of the engine nacelle in close proximity to the ground, increased the probability that  unfastened  latches  would  not  be  seen  during  the pre-departure inspections. 2. The lack of the majority of the high-visibility paint finish on the latch handles reduced the conspicuity of the unfastened latches. 3. The decision by the technicians to engage the latch handle hooks  prevented  the  latch  handles  from  hanging  down beneath the fan cowl doors as intended, further reducing the conspicuity of the unfastened latches.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: AAIB AAR 1/2015 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) AAIB; London-Heathrow Airport (LHR/EGLL); May 2013 photo (c) AAIB; London-Heathrow Airport (LHR/EGLL); 24 May 2013 photo (c) AAIB; London-Heathrow Airport (LHR/EGLL); 24 May 2013 photo (c) Willem GÃ¶ebel; Amsterdam-Schiphol International Airport (AMS/EHAM) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight descended to FL160 and meanwhile RAF Typhoon jets were scrambled to escort the plane to London-Stansted where it landed safely on runway 23 at 13:10 UTC. Initial information suggests that two male passengers had repeatedly tried to get into the cockpit and started making threats. Both men were arrested after landing. A trial was started in November 2013. The prosecutor stated that both men made ""threats to kill members of the cabin crew, threats to kill passengers and threats to blow up the plane whilst it was in flight."" The situation ensued when cabin crew made an announcement asking for a medical professional to assist an elderly passenger who had fallen ill.

Marie Airport, ON (YAM), Canada. There were no reported injuries. Porter Airlines flight 689 was on a visual short final approach to Sault Ste. Marie's Airport runway 30 when power was reduced to correct the descent profile. The aircraft's descent rate quickly increased and was not arrested with power application. The airspeed decreased, causing the approach to become unstabilized. The aircraft landed hard and during the landing flair the pitch angle increased such that the tail of the aircraft contacted the runway surface. There was significant damage to the aircraft skin and structure where it contacted the ground. The aircraft taxied to the gate without further incident. Findings as to causes and contributing factors: 1. Neither crew member identified that the airspeed had dropped below landing reference speed; the flight no longer met the requirements of a stabilized approach, and an overshoot was required. 2. The pilot monitoring did not identify the decreasing airspeed and increasing descent rate in time to notify the pilot flying or intervene. 3. In response to the pilot monitoring's warning to add power, the pilot flying pitched the nose up beyond the limits stated in the standard operating procedures and the manufacturer's pitch awareness training. 4. The high rate of descent coupled with the high nose-up attitude of the aircraft resulted in the hard landing that compressed the struts and allowed the tail to strike the runway. Findings as to risk 1. If standard operating procedures do not clearly define the requirements for a stabilized visual approach, there is an increased risk that continued flight could result in a landing accident. 2. If standard operating procedures do not clearly define the duties of the pilot monitoring, there is an increased risk that unsafe flight conditions could develop.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A13O0098 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: CADORS 2013O1292   Location  Images: photo (c) TSB; Sault Ste.

The airplane, operated by Deraya Air Taxi, departed Jayapura-Sentani Airport (DJJ) on a domestic cargo flight to Wamena Airport (WMX).  The captain acted as Pilot Flying and the first officer acted as Pilot Monitoring (PM). At 06:27 the aircraft departed from Sentani Airport and climbed to the cruising altitude of 12,000 feet.  The first officer contacted the Wamena Tower controller at 07:01, while the aircraft was approaching Pass Valley point. The controller informed that runway 15 was in use and the weather condition was wind calm, visibility 4 km, low cloud on finals and QNH 1008 mbs.  At 07:07, the first officer reported they were on final to runway 15. When reporting runway in sight two minutes later, the controller provided the clearance to land. On short final the aircraft was on heading 140Â° and was on the right side of the correct flight path. The pilot then rolled to the left up to 20Â° to align with the runway, then rolled to the right to align with runway 15. This correction was conducted at altitude between 400 to 200 feet AGL. The aircraft touched down on the centerline. During the landing roll at about 750 meters from the beginning of runway 15 the aircraft veered to the left of the runway shoulder, the pilot recovered by applying the right rudder and asymmetrical reverse thrust but the aircraft continued veer to the left and stopped at about 10 meters on the left shoulder of the runway 15. The nose landing gear detached and was found on the shoulder at about 250 meter from the aircraft's final position. The main landing gears were broken and all the propellers bent. Contributing Factors: The flight did not meet the criteria according to the recommended elements of stabilized approach which required go around. The aircraft touched down with 2Â° misalignment with the runway direction then the aircraft veered off to the left. The recovery action was not in accordance to the correct technique according to the ALAR Tool Kit.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSC Report number: KNKT.13.05.18.04 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) NTSC; Wamena Airport (WMX); 31 May 2013 photo (c) NTSC; Wamena Airport (WMX); 31 May 2013 photo (c) NTSC; Wamena Airport (WMX); 31 May 2013 photo (c) NTSC; Wamena Airport (WMX); 31 May 2013 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Cebu Pacific Air flight 5J-971 was a domestic service from Manila (MNL) to Davao City.  The aircraft touched down on runway 23 at a point about 30 m before the marked touchdown point (TP) about 190 m from the threshold. The airplane came down on the right-half portion very near the right edge lights. The aircraft continued to the right edge of the runway until the right hand main landing gear fell-off the cemented runway at about 129 m from the touchdown point, followed by the nosegear and the left hand main gear about 511 m from TP. With all landing gears on the soft ground the aircraft rolled for about 330 m more with an indication of trying to return to runway and it momentarily crossed over the concrete entrance taxiway of the parking ramp before it made a full-stop on a grassy area ahead and near the runway, about 845 m from TP.  The passengers deplaned via the forward left-hand evacuation slide, which was deployed about fifteen minutes after landing. PROBABLE CAUSE  The Aircraft Accident Investigation and Inquiry Board determined that the probable causes of this accident are the following:  - PilotsÂ lack of event proficiency in low-visibility non-precision approach and landing at night. Human Factor. Pilot Error. Psychological (Psychomotor skill, recent experience). The PIC as pilot flying Pilot Flying (PF) failed to maintain a stabilized landing approach (under precipitation) until below the MDA so that moments before the touchdown (precipitation becoming heavy), the aircraft was still at left of runway centerline with the FO calling (to align) RIGHT which was done by PF but having lost grasp of the centerline, the correction exceeded the centerline with FO calling ( to correct toward the unlighted center ) LEFT but the aircraft already touched down aligned to the right edge lights that was misconstrued by the PF as the center lights ( based on the repeated expressions of the PF during the landing roll until the aircraft has fully stopped ).  - The emergency procedure for go-around was necessary but not utilized. Human Factor. Pilot Error. Psychological (Learning, Emotion/ Mental Narrowed Attention) The pilot probably was experiencing Narrowed Attention due to apprehension by being acutely conscious of the difficulty ahead ( bad weather ). Added to this was his proficiency status ( one flight to Davao in last 3 months ) and at confusion to notice things in the periphery of his attention i.e., to execute a go-around and make another approach well-prepared on the techniques with lower precipitation level. Contributory Factors:  - Adverse weather condition. Environmental factor. Natural Environment  The weather condition severely affected the judgment and decision-making of the PIC even prior to the approach to land. Heavy rainfall obscured the horizontal visibility of the pilots preventing a clear view of the runway.  - Absence of runway center lights. Environmental factor. Man-made Environment (Aerodrome) The PIC misconstrued the edge lights as the runway center lights. Low-visibility approaches require that these lights be present to help guide the pilots toward the runway center.  - Inadequate CRM procedures. Human factor. Psychological. (Training)  Standard and non-standard call-outs and responses are the hallmarks of an effective cockpit/CRM environment. There were lapses, omissions and contradictory words employed during the landing approach.  - Inadequate pilot re-currency training methods. Human Factor. Psychological. (Training)  Missed approach procedures during low-visibility non-precision approaches were seldom practiced during the re-currency training of the pilots. The over-use of baseline airports with runway center lights deprived the pilots the opportunity to hone their instrument flying skills in basic airports where they usually operate that has no center lights. - Lack of policy on the advisory role of air traffic controllers ( ATC ). Human Factor. Psychological. (Training)  During adverse weather conditions the ATC has no participation in the safety decisions which would require runway closure during critical aerodrome conditions especially in environmental conditions below runway visual minimaMETAR: 10:00 UTC / 18:00 local time: METAR RPMD 021000Z 14002 9999 TS BKN015 CB SCT090 BKN290 29/26 Q1008 CB SW-SE AND OVHD DIST PCPN NW LITS NWinds: 140 degrees at 2 knots; Visibility: 6 or more miles (10+ km); Ceiling: 1500 feet AGL; Clouds: broken clouds at 1500 feet AGL, scattered clouds at 9000 feet AGL, broken clouds at 29000 feet AGL; Thunderstorm; Temperature: 29Â°C; Dewpoint: 26Â°C; Pressure: 1008.0 mb.

The pilot was killed. The pilot had sold his previous Beechcraft B200 King Air on the day of the accident and he had bought a B200GT, which had a different avionics suite than he was used to. He flew from Georgetown, Texas to Baton Rouge, Louisiana and dropped off two passengers there. The pilot elected to continue to McComb. The airplane departed runway 31 at Baton Rouge. Just after takeoff, the controller assigned the pilot a heading and altitude to McComb (MCB). The airplane turned northeast, on course, and reached an altitude of 1,200 feet. The radar track data then showed the airplane in a slow descent and slowing down; the airplane then disappeared from radar, prior to the accident site. The last radio transmission from the pilot was that he was going to crash. The airplane came down in a residential area at Rue Jennifer in the Baker suburb of Baton Rouge.

The aircraft, flight MU2947, departed the left side of runway 18L onto taxiway A2 while landing at Hongqiao International Airport in moderate rain. The 5 crewmembers and 44 passengers were uninjured, and the nose landing gear sustained minor damage.  After this incident, the nosewheel steering manifold assembly and electrohydraulic servo valve (EHSV) were tested by the componentsÂ manufacturers according to their returned component acceptance test protocols, which are the same tests that newly manufactured components would undergo before delivery. After both components passed their respective acceptance tests, they were removed and disassembled; foreign object debris (FOD) was discovered inside the EHSV housing in an area where it could block a hydraulic port, subsequently leading to an uncommanded left nosewheel turn.METAR: 09:00 UTC / 17:00 local time: ZSSS 070900Z 11009G15MPS 2500 SHRA BR BKN009 OVC040 21/20 Q1000 BECMG TL1030 3000 -SHRA09:30 UTC / 17:30 local time: ZSSS 070930Z 11008G13MPS 070V140 7000 -SHRA BKN009 OVC040 21/19 Q1000 RESHRA NOSIGWind 110 degrees at 16 knots, gusting to 25 knots, direction varying between 070 and 140 degrees, Visibility: 7000 m; light rain showers; broken clouds at 900 feet AGL; overcast cloud deck at 4000 feet AGL; Temperature: 21Â°C, Dewpoint: 19Â°C; Pressure: 1000 mb, recent moderate/heavy rain showers.

There were 165 passengers and five crew members on board. Three occupants were injured. Flight W6-3141 departed Bucharest-Henri Coanda International Airport (OTP) about 06:45 hours local time (03:45 UTC) on an international passenger flight to Roma-Ciampino Airport (CIA). The flight was approaching Ciampino Airport's runway 15 about 07:20 local time (05:20 UTC) when the crew encountered problems getting the undercarriage down and locked. A Master Warning occurred and a message was shown on the Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitoring (ECAM) display, which indicated ""L/G GEAR NOT DOWNLOCKED"". The crew flew a missed approach procedure and headed to an area north of Rome were it entered a holding pattern at an altitude of 5000 feet. The crew carried out a recycle and performed a gravity extension as well as some g-force manoeuvres, but the left hand main landing gear remained stuck. The crew decided to divert to Rome-Fiumicino.  Approaching Rome-Fiumicino Airport runway 34R at 07:58 (05:58 UTC), the aircraft was instructed by the Tower controller to go-around due to some incoherency in the information provided by the crew about the current position of the landing gear. A new approach to runway 34R was performed and the aircraft touched down on the runway at 08:06 (06:06 UTC) with the left main gear only partially extended. The flightcrew shutoff the left engine just before touchdown and the right one a few seconds later. The aircraft came to rest after scraping the left engine on the runway for about 1200 m. An emergency evacuation was carried out.Sources: ANSV History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  28 September 2021 HA-LWM Wizz Air 0 Iași International Airport (IAS/LRIA) non 25 August 2024 HA-LWM Wizz Air Malta 0 S of Budapest non Fumes/smoke/odor event Location  Images: photo (c) Miklos SZABO; Budapest-Ferihegy Airport (BUD/LHBP); 19 March 2012 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.
