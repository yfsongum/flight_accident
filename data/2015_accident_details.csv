At 08:32 hrs G-LGNL was cleared to enter runway 18 at Stornoway Airport and take off, and the ATC controller transmitted that the surface wind was from 270Â° at 27 kt. The commander commented to the co-pilot that the wind was across the runway and that there was no tailwind. As the aircraft taxied onto the runway, the co-pilot applied almost full right aileron input consistent with a cross-wind from the right, and the commander said to the co-pilot ""charlie , one hundred, strong wind from the right"". The commander advanced the power levers, the co-pilot said ""autocoarsen high"" and the engine torques increased symmetrically. The commander instructed the co-pilot to ""set takeoff power"" to which the co-pilot replied ""apr armed"". Approximately one second after this call, the engine torques began to increase symmetrically, reaching 100% as the aircraft accelerated through 70 kt. During the early stages of the takeoff, left rudder was applied and the aircraft maintained an approximately constant heading. As the aircraft continued accelerating, the rudder was centralised, after which there was a small heading change to the left, then to the right, then a rapid heading change to the left causing the aircraft to deviate to the left of the runway centreline. The pilot applied right rudder but although the aircraft changed heading to the right in response, it did not alter the aircraftÂs track significantly and the aircraft skidded to the left, departing the runway surface onto the grass at an IAS of 80 kt. The power levers remained at full power as the aircraft crossed a disused runway and back onto grass. During this period the nose landing gear collapsed before the aircraft came to a halt approximately 38 m left of the edge of the runway and 250 m from where it first left the paved surface. After the aircraft came to a halt, the captain saw that the propellers were still turning and so called into the cabin for the passengers to remain seated. One of the passengers shouted for someone to open the emergency exit but the cabin crew member instructed the passengers not to do so because the propellers were still turning. The co-pilot observed that the right propeller was still turning so operated the engine fire extinguishers to shut down both engines. When the passenger seated in the emergency exit row on the right of the aircraft saw that the right propeller had stopped, he decided to open the exit. He climbed out onto the wing and helped the remaining passengers leave the aircraft through the same exit, instructing them to slide off the rear of the wing onto the ground. The left propeller was still turning at the time the right over-wing exit was opened and the passenger seated in the left-side emergency exit row decided not to open the left exit. The technique for controlling the direction of the aircraft on the runway is to use rudder assisted by nose wheel steering (NWS) at low speeds because the rudder has reduced effectiveness below 40 kt. When rudder is used, the requirement for NWS to assist directional control will reduce progressively as speed increases above 40 kt and rudder effectiveness increases. It is likely that no assistance will be required by 60 kt and, therefore, there will be no step-change in NWS directional effect when the pilot releases the steering control. During this attempted takeoff, rudder was approximately neutral from 40 kt, the point at which it would have become effective, and directional control was probably maintained through NWS alone (asymmetric thrust or differential braking having been discounted). If rudder had been applied, there would have been a reduced NWS requirement at any given speed and therefore there would have been a reduced likelihood of a change directional effect when the NWS control was released. The lack of data showing NWS commands meant that these considerations could not be verified.

The flight to Matthews Ridge was uneventful until the final approach to land. The aircraft approached the runway from the left and had to make a steep bank in an attempt to establish on the runway centerline. The aircraft was slow in the turn and was possibly further slowed by the steep bank causing the aircraft to exhibit the characteristics of an imminent accelerated stall. This forced the aircraft's rate of sink to increase and the pilot was unable to stabilize the aircraft's approach. The aircraft's port wing touched the ground first, followed by the port undercarriage. There were no injuries or fatalities. Cause: The probable cause of the accident was that the aircraft was slow and close to the threshold on left base of RWY29. The pilot executed and maintained a steep left turn which resulted in the aircraft experiencing an incipient accelerated stall. Contributory Causes: 1. The approach to landing was not properly configured, which resulted in an unsafe and unstable approach. 2. Although he felt the aircraft buffeting, the pilot did not recognize that there was an impending accelerated stall and did not react in a timely manner to correct it. 3. The weather was not conducive to VFR operations. 4. Given the prevailing weather conditions, the pilot should not have descended below the MSA of 3000ft. 5. It is believed that the pilot may have established a mindset to land because another pilot had landed four minutes earlier.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: GCAA-AIT Report number: GCAA: 2/5/1/78 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

On board were the flight crew of two and approximately 4,600 kg of freight.  The flight crew carried out the pre-start checklist and then started the right engine, after which the ground crew were given the signal to disconnect the ground power unit (GPU), positioned directly in front of the aircraft. The commander expected to see the GPU being moved clear of the aircraft, but when this did not happen he signaled the left engine start to the ground crew, which was approved. With the left engine started, the commander signaled for the nosewheel chocks to be removed, which was actioned by the ground crew. Immediately the chocks were removed, the aircraft began to move forward and the first officer saw the ground crew member run clear of the aircraft to the right. Both flight crew members immediately applied wheel brakes, but as they did so, the aircraft collided with the GPU. The flight crew shut down both engines and informed ATC. There were no injuries and damage was confined to forward parts of the aircraft and the top cover of the GPU. After the accident the flight crew realised that the parking brake was not set, resulting in the aircraftÂs movement when the chocks were removed. The commander noted that there had been an expectation that the parking brake would have been set to on when the crew first arrived at the aircraft. The parking brake was not an item on the turnaround checklist which the crew had carried out earlier, although it was an item on the pre-start checklist which had therefore not been carried out correctly. The commander also observed that the signal to remove the chocks was given before the GPU had been moved clear of the aircraft. Although the flight crew had not felt rushed, the commander believed that they had been under a time pressure due to the imminent airport closure, and that this had been a contributory factor.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: EW/G2015/01/05 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  11 March 2021 SE-MAI West Air Sweden 0 near East Midlands Airport, Castle Donington, Leicestershire non Fumes/smoke/odor event Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The sixteen occupants of the plane were not injured. Executive Secretary Paquito Ochoa and Communications Secretary Herminio Coloma Jr. were on board the private jet that departed following the visit of Pope Francis to Tacloban. Due to the approaching Tropical Storm Amang (Mekkhala) the Papal visit was cut short and all aircraft were prepared for departure. At 13:04 hours, the Global 5000 was given start up clearance by tower controller and subsequently a taxi clearance at 13:08 to exit via the south taxiway next to a departing Airbus A320 carrying the Papal entourage. Prevailing wind condition were 290Â° with a 18 knots crosswind and temperature of 24Â° . The airplane then had to wait for another A320 to depart at 13:22, which took-off with prevailing wind conditions of 290Â° with a 23 kts crosswind.  At 13:35 the Global 5000 was finally cleared for take-off from runway 36. The wind condition at that time was 300Â° at 18 kts with gustiness and a temperature of 24Â°. The aircrew performed a rolling take-off and the acceleration was normal, the pilot nonflying (NPF) called for air speed alive, 80 knots, V1 and Rotate. Before approaching the south taxiway abeam the terminal building, the aircraft started to veer to the left side of the runway centerline. The aircraft continued to roll veering to the left side of the runway and the left hand main landing gear was already out of the runway after the north taxiway. The aircraft suffered a runway excursion and sustained substantial damage after simultaneous collision with the concrete bases of runway edge lights and to the concrete culvert before it came to a complete stop at approximately 1500 meters from the take-off point. PROBABLE CAUSE: The Aircraft Accident Investigation and Inquiry Board determined that the probable cause of this accident was:  - Lack of recurrent training of the flight crew Routine flights do not prepare a pilot for unusual situations, whether they are unexpected crosswinds or systems/engine anomalies. Pilots should receive regular recurrent training to include abnormal and emergency procedures. - The existing runway edge light design The PIC tried to recover the aircraft back to the runway but apparently the aircraft left main landing gears already hit or bumped the concrete base of runway edge lights. The design of runway strips or shoulder must be free from fixed objects other than frangible visual aids provided for the guidance of aircraft and must notbe constructed with sharp edges; and where the lights will not normally come into contact with aircraft wheels, such as threshold lights, runway end lights and runway edge lights; - Human Factors Due to deteriorating adverse weather conditions and due to the delay of their initial request for take-off clearance plus the sudden change of flight plan affected the CaptainÂs ability to perform a take-off procedure as recommended in the aircraft flight manual and instead delegated flight control duties to the F/O resulting in the loss of coordination between the flight crew.Sources: GMA News   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Swiss International Air Lines flight LX1189 was preparing for departure to Zurich, Switzerland and the doors of the aircraft were closed. The aircraft was being de-iced when the de-icing employee heard the APU revving up. This was followed by a loud bang. After a second loud bang the APU stopped. Debris from the APU engine penetrated the pressure bulkhead and smoke appeared in the passenger cabin. The passengers were directed to the front of the cabin and all occupants left the plane through the forward exit. The APU air intake is located on the right of the fuselage, on the transition from the fin to the fuselage. De-icing fluid can easily enter through the open air intake when the APU is in operation. Furthermore, the de-icing agent causes a strong fog when applied, due to the difference in temperature. This restricts the visibility of the air intake. In addition, the area around the air inlet of the APU is not marked, making it harder to notice the location of the intake. The BFU notes that a safety recommendation of the NTSB following a similar accident, requested the APU to be switched off when the aircraft is de-iced. This measure had not been implemented in Europe. Conclusions: The failure of the APU and the resulting consequential damage was due to the intake and combustion of de-icing fluid. Visual restrictions and inadequate marking have contributed to the accident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BFU Report number: BFU AX001-15 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years Download report:  Final report Sources: BFU AX001-15 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  4 September 2003 N1450A American Airlines 0 New York-La Guardia Airport, NY (LGA/KLGA) sub Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Sky Express flight GQ100 was a domestic passenger flight from Heraklion on the Greek island of Crete to the island of Rhodes. The aircraft took off at 07:00 hours local time. Prior to departure the flight crew had been briefed that in the area of the Rhodes Airport the winds were S-SE at 17 kt with wind gust to 36 kt. For winds like these, the Rhodes (LGRP) AIP stated: ""Pilots landing or taking off at RODOS/ DIAGORAS Airport should exercise extreme caution when South or SouthEast (S-SE) winds of more than 15 Kts prevail, as moderate or severe turbulence and wind shear may be encountered on the final approach and/or initial climb out areas (mainly of RWY 07)."" At 07:23 hrs., approximately 12 min prior to landing, in the first contact of the flight crew with the Control Tower of Rhodes Airport, the flight crew was told winds were variable with a direction from 20Â° to 160Â°, average wind direction from 110Â°, wind velocity 20 kt gusting 38 kt. As laid down in the airport procedures, ATC, given the weather conditions, alerted the fire service vehicles to be stationed in readiness at their designated positions on the taxiways. Rhodes ATC then reminded the flight crew that as a result of the strong wind shear and turbulence, landing at the airport was not recommended under the circumstances. At 07:29 Rhodes ATC contacted the flight, informing that the wind was shifting from 40Â° to 260Â°, average wind direction from 120Â°, mean wind velocity 20 kt and wind gust 32 kt. Three minutes later, at about 8 nm from the airport, ATC contacted the flight crew again and informed that wind in the last ten minutes was shifting in all directions, with mean wind velocity 16 kt and wind gust 37 kt; ATC also repeated that under these conditions landing was not recommended. At 07:34, at about 4 nm to the airport, Rhodes ATC gave the crew a weather update: wind was shifting from 60Â° to 200Â°, mean wind velocity 15 kt, wind gust 32 kt and runway 07 was free for landing. One minute later ATC reported wind direction from 110Â°, 17kt. Given the prevailing winds, landing with 9Â° flaps and an airspeed of about 129 kt was selected by the crew. The flight continued to land and touched down at 07:36, with the right main landing gear touching down first. During deceleration immediately after touchdown, the aircraft veered to the left and came to rest at the left edge of the runway without exiting the runway. Probable Causes:  The decision to perform a landing following a non-stabilized approach. Landing with a strong and variable wind, the speed and the crosswind component of which were in excess of the values specified by the standard operating procedures, the aircraft manufacturer and the recommendations for the said aerodrome in AIP GREECE.

A TransAsia ATR-72-600 operating as flight GE235 from Taipei to Kinmen Island impacted a highway viaduct and the waters of the Keelung River near New Taipei City shortly after takeoff. Forty-three occupants on board the airplane suffered fatal injuries. Fifteen were injured. The airplane took off from Taipei-Sung Shan Airport's runway 10 at 10:51 hours local time and turned right, climbing to an altitude of 1350 feet. At 10:52 the master warning sounded in the cockpit associated with the right engine (no. 2) flame out procedure message. Some 26 seconds later the left hand (no. 1) power lever was retarded to flight idle. After twenty seconds the left engine condition lever was set to the fuel shutoff position resulting in left engine shutdown. Instead of continuing the climbing right hand turn, the airplane had turned left and began losing altitude and speed with several stall warnings sounding in the cockpit. At 10:53, the flight contacted the Sung Shan Tower controller declaring a Mayday and reporting an 'engine flameout'. The airplane then turned to the right while the crew attempted to restart the left hand engine. This succeeded at 10:54:20 hours. Fourteen seconds later the stall warning sounded in the cockpit. Video footage of the accident show that the airplane banked almost 90 degrees left as it hit a taxi on a viaduct. Parts of the left hand wing broke off upon hitting the barrier of the viaduct. The airplane broke up as it impacted the Keelung River and came to rest inverted. Findings Related to Probable Causes: Powerplant 1. An intermittent signal discontinuity between the auto feather unit (AFU) number 2 and the torque sensor may have caused the automatic take off power control system (ATPCS): - Not being armed steadily during takeoff roll; - Being activated during initial climb which resulted in a complete ATPCS sequence including the engine number 2 autofeathering.  2. The available evidence indicated the intermittent discontinuity between torque sensor and auto feather unit (AFU) number 2 was probably caused by the compromised soldering joints inside the AFU number 2.  Flight Operations 3. The flight crew did not reject the take off when the automatic take off power control system ARM pushbutton did not light during the initial stages of the take off roll. 4. TransAsia did not have a clear documented company policy with associated instructions, procedures, and notices to crew for ATR72-600 operations communicating the requirement to reject the take off if the automatic take off power control system did not arm.  5. Following the uncommanded autofeather of engine number 2, the flight crew failed to perform the documented failure identification procedure before executing any actions. That resulted in pilot flying's confusion regarding the identification and nature of the actual propulsion system malfunction and he reduced power on the operative engine number 1.  6. The flight crew's non-compliance with TransAsia Airways ATR72-600 standard operating procedures - Abnormal and Emergency Procedures for an engine flame out at take off resulted in the pilot flying reducing power on and then shutting down the wrong engine.  7. The loss of engine power during the initial climb and inappropriate flight control inputs by the pilot flying generated a series of stall warnings, including activation of the stick pusher. The crew did not respond to the stall warnings in a timely and effective manner. 8. The loss of power from both engines was not detected and corrected by the crew in time to restart an engine. The aircraft stalled during the attempted restart at an altitude from which the aircraft could not recover from loss of control.  9. Flight crew coordination, communication, and threat and error management (TEM) were less than effective, and compromised the safety of the flight. Both operating crew members failed to obtain relevant data from each other regarding the status of both engines at different points in the occurrence sequence. The pilot flying did not appropriately respond to or integrate input from the pilot monitoring.METAR: 02:00 UTC / 10:00 local time: RCSS 040200Z 11007KT 9999 -DZ FEW013 BKN028 BKN040 16/14 Q1024 NOSIG RMK A302602:25 UTC / 10:25 local time: RCSS 040225Z 10008KT 9999 FEW013 BKN028 BKN040 16/13 Q1024 NOSIG RMK A302603:00 UTC / 11:00 local time: RCSS 040300Z 10010KT 9999 FEW015 BKN028 BKN040 16/13 Q1024 NOSIG RMK A3025Winds: 100 degrees at 10 knots; few clouds at 1500 feet; broken clouds at 2800 feet; broken clouds at 4000 feet; Temperature: 16Â°C; Dewpoint: 13Â°C; Pressure: 1024 mbAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: ASC Report number: ASC-AOR-16-06-001 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: ASC Taiwan  Location  Images: photo (c) M940504; near Taipei-Sung Shan Airport (TSA); 04 February 2015; (publicdomain) photo (c) Aviation Safety Council; near Taipei-Sung Shan Airport (TSA); 04 February 2015 photo (c) Aviation Safety Council; near Taipei-Sung Shan Airport (TSA); 04 February 2015 photo (c) Hyun Fumio; Taipei-Sung Shan Airport (TSA); 17 July 2014; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) Yi-Fan Wu; Taipei-Sung Shan Airport (TSA); 24 January 2015 photo (c) Yi-Fan Wu; Taipei-Sung Shan Airport (TSA); 27 September 2014 photo (c) Yi-Fan Wu; Taipei-Sung Shan Airport (TSA); 21 September 2014 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates02-Jan-2025 10:56 ASN Updated [Source, Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All four occupants sustained fatal injuries. The airplane had undergone routine maintenance in Miami and was returning to Venezuela at the time of the accident. An NTSB review of maintenance records revealed that the left engine propeller had been due for overhaul. It was removed and replaced with an overhauled propeller prior to the accident flight and the accident flight was the first flight after the overhauled propeller was installed on the left engine.  The flight was cleared for takeoff at 14:36:45 hours local time. At 14:38:15, one of the pilots reported an ""engine failure"" to air traffic control. The controller asked the pilot if he would like to return to the airport and the pilot replied affirmative. The controller then offered a 180-degree turn to runway 9R and the pilot requested a left traffic pattern to runway 27L, which the controller approved; however, the airplane subsequently impacted a utility pole and terrain about 4,5 km west of the runway. The highest altitude recorded on radar was 300 feet. A postcrash fire consumed a majority of the cockpit and cabin.  It appeared that the no.1 engine prop feathered after takeoff and that the engine was shut down prior to the accident. PROBABLE CAUSE: "" The left engine propeller's uncommanded travel to the feathered position during takeoff for reasons that could not be determined due to impact damage.

Of the 250 passengers and crew onboard, one flight attendant was seriously injured, and three flight attendants and one passenger sustained minor injuries. The airplane was not damaged. The flight was operating under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 as a regularly scheduled passenger flight from Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), Newark, New Jersey, to HNL. The flight was uneventful from EWR across the continental United States. Once over the Pacific Ocean, the flight received an ACARS message from dispatch advising of an area of possible embedded thunderstorms. The flight experienced light to moderate turbulence for most of the remaining flight, which required the seat belt sign to remain on most of the time. About an hour from HNL, the captain returned early from his crew rest time because he noticed that the flight was encountering areas of moderate turbulence. Prior to entering the flight deck, the captain noticed that the flight attendants (FA) were seated in their jumpseats and advised the lead FA to not conduct the final service and remain seated.Â Â Shortly after retaking the left seat, and as the flight was passing immediately south of a line of embedded of the forecasted thunderstorms, the captain requested a descent from their cruising altitude of flight level (FL)360 to FL240. The flight crew reported they were in instrument meteorological conditions with precipitation during the descent. The weather radar was on and the seatbelt sign was illuminated. The flight encountered an area of severe turbulence for about 30 seconds as it was descending through FL254. The flight data recorder data indicate that the vertical acceleration fluctuated between about -0.17 g's and  1.62 g's, the lateral acceleration fluctuated between about -0.09 g's and  0.11 g's, and the roll fluctuated between about 5Â° left and 12Â° right. At the time of the turbulence, the FAs were securing the galleys, preparing the cabin for landing, and distributing agriculture documents.Â Â Four flight attendants (FA) in the aft galley were thrown against the ceiling and back to the floor, injuring all four. After being notified of the serious injuries, the flight crew declared an emergency with air traffic control and arranged for medical personnel to meet the aircraft at HNL. The four flight attendants were transported to the hospital where one flight attendant was diagnosed with a fractured arm and the other three were released with minor injuries. After landing the crew were notified by a passenger that their child had suffered a bloody nose, who was treated but not transported to the hospital. Probable Cause: an encounter with convective turbulence associated with a forecasted area of thunderstorms.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA15LA067 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA15LA067  https://flightaware.com/live/flight/UAL15/history/20150214/1410Z/KEWR/PHNL  http://www.khon2.com/news/local-news/nine-flights-to-and-from-the-islands-experience-weather-related-complications_20180309114038891/1025642249 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  17 December 2014 N59053 United Airlines 0 London Heathrow Airport (LHR/EGLL) non 6 March 2016 N59053 United Airlines 0 Houston-George Bush Intercontinental Airport, TX (IAH/KIAH) unk Bird strike Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates02-Jun-2023 13:19 ASN Update Bot Added 15-Jun-2023 20:52 Ron Averes Updated Corrections or additions? ...

The crew followed the emergency checklist and selected gear down and the indications changed to green, indicating that the landing gear was now down-and-locked. The crew elected to continue to Guernsey, Channel Islands with the undercarriage down. The aircraft performed an ILS approach and landed on runway 27. On touchdown, the aircraft pulled to the left and the co-pilot reported that there was no brake pressure. The commander suspected a tyre had burst and that hydraulic pressure had been lost. He therefore changed to the alternative braking system, slowed the aircraft and vacated the runway. The flight crew continued to taxi the aircraft and eight minutes passed before Guernsey ATC were informed that a tyre may have burst. Another aircraft landed on the runway during this period and before a runway inspection was initiated. Once G-RAJJ was parked, the crew discovered that the shock absorber on the left landing gear had separated and the tyre on the No 1 mainwheel had burst. Debris from the tyre and shock absorber was subsequently found on runway 27. The shock absorber separated either as a result of a hard landing, or incorrect gas pressures and oil level in the shock absorber. The physical damage to the shock absorber diaphragm threads and locking bolts started at least two flight cycles prior to the accident flight and may have occurred whilst it was fitted to another aircraft.

The flight crew elected to divert to St. Louis.  Although the activation of the fire suppression was a false alarm, the decision to divert was prudent and correct.  During the approach the crew made the decision to evacuate the airplane after landing, briefed the passengers in the courier area, and reviewed the evacuation checklist in the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH).  The diversion and subsequent landing were performed without issue.  After exiting the runway, and bringing the airplane to a stop in a safe area, the crew initiated an emergency evacuation using the left forward door (1L).  The door opened, however, the 1L escape slide/raft did not fully deploy, appearing to be hung up on a strap.  The first officer attempted to free it and the fire/rescue crew pulled on the slide and it appeared to inflate.  However, because the slide inflation sequence had been interrupted, it was significantly underinflated and unable to support the weight of the crewmember, resulting in a serious injury.  Post-incident examination of the 1L slide/raft was unable to determine the causes for the slide/raft to not inflate to full extension.

Marie Airport, ON (YAM) -   Canada","Landing","Passenger - Scheduled","Toronto-Pearson International Airport, ON (YYZ/CYYZ)","Sault Ste. Marie Airport, ON (YAM/CYAM)"," TSB","Accident investigation report completed and information captured","Air Canada Express flight 7795 was a scheduled domestic flight from Toronto/Lester B. Pearson International Airport, Canada, to Sault Ste. Marie Airport. On board the DHC-8-102 aircraft were 15 passengers, 2 flight crew members, and 1 cabin crew member. The captain performed the role of pilot flying (PF) and the first officer performed the role of pilot monitoring (PM). Just prior to descent from cruise altitude, the PF briefed the PM for the expected approach into Sault Ste. Marie. The PF was aware of the marginal weather conditions and included the possibility of a go-around and diversion in the briefing. As part of the briefing, the flight crew set the approach speed bugs to the appropriate speed for aircraft weight and flight conditions. The crew determined that the applicable landing reference speed (Vref) was 96 knots, which required an approach speed bug setting of 101 knots. When the aircraft was approximately 42 nautical miles (nm) from CYAM, the controller at the Toronto Area Control Centre cleared the flight to descend to 5000 feet above sea level (ASL) and, given the expected weather conditions, requested that the crew report when they had the airport in sight for the visual approach. As AC7795 reached 15 nm from Sault Ste. Marie in level flight at 5000 feet ASL, the crew reported that the in-flight visibility was reduced due to ice crystals. In consideration of this, they requested to be cleared for the VOR/DME approach to runway 30, rather than the visual approach, and were cleared as requested. While descending out of 3000 feet ASL, the flight crew passed through the area of ice crystals and acquired the airport visually. Although the flight was now in visual conditions, the crew noticed a significant snow shower approaching the arrival runway from the west. They reported these conditions to the controller, who cleared the flight for the visual approach, instructing them to deviate as necessary from the VOR approach. At 18:21:34 the aircraft passed over the final approach fix, 8.7 nm from the runway threshold, at a height of 2840 feet above ground level (AGL) and an indicated airspeed of 204 knots. The aircraft was descending on a 3Â° vertical path, although this was done visually, rather than with avionics-based vertical navigation guidance. The aircraft slowly decelerated from 204 to 181 knots while maintaining the 3Â° vertical path in descent from 2840 feet to 1500 feet. At 18:22:50, when AC7795 was 5 nm from Sault Ste. Marie, the flight crew contacted the Sault Ste. Marie control tower for landing clearance. The controller informed the crew that the wind was from 310Â° magnetic (M) at 22 knots with gusts to 29 knots, and mentioned the line of weather currently rolling across the runway. The controller further informed the crew that, due to this weather, the runway visual range (RVR) visibility had decreased to 1100 feet, with the runway lights set to level 4 intensity. The PM responded that they could see the approaching weather. At 18:23:05 and at 1500 feet, the power levers were moved toward flight idle and the engine torque reduced to between 3% and 4%. The aircraft began to decelerate more rapidly. The tower controller then informed AC7795 that the RVR had now reduced to 1000 feet, with the runway lights now at level 5 (full) intensity. Wind was reported as from 310Â°M at 25 knots, and JZA7795 was cleared to land. At 18:23:49, at 1000 feet and 2.8 nm from the runway threshold, the flaps were extended to 15Â° and the PF increased torque to 25%. The aircraft's airspeed was 148 knots. Between 1000 feet and 500 feet on approach, the aircraft generally maintained the 3Â° vertical path as the speed decreased from 148 to 122 knots. The engine torque varied during that time between 5% and 30% to account for configuration changes and wind gusts. At 500 feet, the airspeed was 122 knots, or 21 knots higher than the bugged approach speed of 101 knots. The aircraft was on the appropriate vertical path and torque was steady at 25%. The PF made the 8Â° left turn to align the aircraft with the runway heading. At 18:24:56, air traffic control (ATC) provided one last update to JZA7795, stating that the RVR was now 1200 feet. At 200 feet and at an airspeed of 124 knots, the PF began to reduce torque to idle and, as a result, the airspeed began to decrease rapidly. Although the aircraft's nose-up pitch was gradually increased and vertical speed was relatively stable, the vertical path steepened due to the decreasing airspeed and resultant ground speed reduction. The aircraft drifted below the 3Â° vertical path. This would normally be visually indicated by 4 red lights on the precision approach path indicator (PAPI), meaning the aircraft is too low. At some point below 200 feet, the flight crew lost visual reference to the ground due to the approaching weather system of blowing snow. The approach was continued. At 18:25:15, the terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS) issued a verbal alert to the pilots indicating that the aircraft's height was 50 feet. Then, at 20 feet, torque was increased toward 30%. At 18:25:19, the aircraft contacted the ground approximately 450 feet (137 meters) prior to the runway threshold at an airspeed of 94 knots. The ground preceding the runway was covered in approximately 8 to 12 inches of snow. The aircraft was in a level pitch attitude when it contacted the surface and touched down with a peak vertical acceleration of 2.32g. Following touchdown, the nose landing gear assembly and wheel struck and damaged an approach light located 300 feet prior to the runway threshold. The flight crew heard a thump, but had not seen the light and were unsure what had caused the noise. The aircraft came to a stop on the runway centreline, approximately 1500 feet past the threshold. The flight crew assessed the ground visibility as very poor, due to the blowing snow. Unsure of the aircraft's status, the flight crew informed the tower controller that the aircraft may have landed short of the runway and may have clipped the nosewheel. The crew asked the control tower to send a vehicle to their position to assess the situation, and requested that a bus be sent to move the passengers. When the emergency vehicles arrived and assessed the condition of the aircraft, no significant damage was noticed. Upon receiving this information, the flight crew elected to taxi the aircraft to the gate. The aircraft taxied to the gate without further incident, and the crew shut down the engines and deplaned the passengers. The crew did not believe there was damage to the aircraft and, therefore, did not pull the circuit breaker to prevent the cockpit voice recorder data from being overwritten. As a result, relevant data that would have been captured on the 30-minute cockpit voice recorder was overwritten while the aircraft remained electrically powered at the gate. After exiting the aircraft at the gate, the crew was notified of damage to an approach light and contacted maintenance to have the aircraft inspected. The aircraft sustained significant damage, mostly localized to the area near the nose landing gear, which had struck the approach light. The nose gear and nose gear doors were damaged and required replacement. Additionally, both main landing gear were determined to have exceeded load limits and required replacement. Findings as to causes and contributing factors: 1. The company standard operating procedures require an approach speed of Vref + 5 knots; however, this is being interpreted by flight crews as a target to which they should decelerate, from 120 knots, once the aircraft is below 500 feet. As a result, the majority of examined approaches, including the occurrence approach, were unstable, due to this deceleration. 2. Due to ambiguity in the guidance and uncertainty as to the required speeds during the approach, the crew did not recognize that the approach was unstable, and continued. 3. On the approach, the pilot flying reduced power to idle to reduce the approach speed from 122 knots toward 101 knots at 200 feet above ground level. This steepened the aircraft's vertical path. 4. The rapidly decreasing visibility resulted in the airport environment and the precision approach path indicator lights becoming obscured; as a result, the steepened vertical profile went unnoticed and uncorrected. 5. Although the loss of visual reference required a go-around, the crew continued the approach to land as a result of plan continuation bias. 6. The terrain awareness and warning system did not alert the crew to the aircraft's proximity to the ground once the aircraft was below 50 feet, possibly due to the rapid rate of closure. This lack of warning contributed to the crew not being aware of the aircraft's height above ground. 7. Due to the uncorrected steepened vertical profile, loss of visual reference, and lack of normal terrain warning, the aircraft contacted the surface approximately 450 feet prior to the runway threshold. Findings as to risk: 1. If guidance provided to flight crews allows for large tolerance windows, and crews are not trained to recognize an unstable condition, then there is a continued risk that flights that are unstable will be continued to a landing. 2. If approaches that require excessive deceleration below established stabilization heights are routinely flown, then there is a continued risk of an approach or landing accident. 3. If crews do not report unstable approaches and operators do not conduct flight data monitoring but rely only on safety management system reports to determine the frequency of unstable approaches, there is a risk that these issues will persist and contribute to an accident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A15O0015 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources: Flightaware  Sault Star 28-2-2015   Location  Images: photo (c) Google Earth; Sault Ste.

Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and an IFR flight plan was filed for the flight from Marathon-Florida Keys Airport (MTH), Florida. The airplane sustained substantial damage. The airline transport pilot and co-pilot, 1 flight attendant, and 4 passengers were not injured, 1 passenger sustained serious injuries, and 1 passenger sustained minor injuries. The flight originated from MTH about 15:54. The pilot-in-command (PIC) stated that the landing dry and wet distances were calculated to be 3,166 and 4,166 feet, respectively. The flight departed MTH and while en route they obtained the MKY automated weather observing station (AWOS) which indicated the wind was from 250 degrees at 5 knots, and the visibility was 10 miles. The PIC further stated they reviewed the speeds (Vref of 133 knots), and planned a visual approach to runway 17. Air traffic control approved their request for a visual approach, and they changed to the common traffic advisory frequency, entering left downwind for runway 17. They slowed, lowered the flaps to 20 degrees, and noted rain 2 to 3 miles east of MKY, though the airport appeared to be dry. When the flight was abeam runway 17, the landing gear was lowered and the flaps were extended to 30 degrees. The landing checklist was performed, and the anti-skid test was normal. The thrust reversers were armed, and he performed a ""teardrop turn"" to final. With flaps at 45 degrees, gear down, and flying Vref plus 10 knots, a couple of gusts were encountered during the approach. The co-pilot checked the AWOS again; the wind was still 250 degrees at 5 knots. He maintained a normal glide path at Vref plus 4 or 5 knots at the runway threshold, where he positioned both thrust levers to idle. The airplane was landed firm about 300 to 500 feet beyond the aiming point marking, and after touchdown he was unable to extend the ground spoilers. When the nose landing gear contacted the runway, he applied ""moderate"" brakes and held the control yoke forward, but felt no deceleration. He also attempted to deploy the thrust reversers but was unable. The PIC informed the co-pilot there was no braking energy and released the brakes; the anti-skid was turned off and the brakes were re-applied pressing hard. He did not feel any deceleration, and again tried to deploy the thrust reversers, but was unable. He kept the airplane on the runway centerline, and began modulating the brakes. Unable to stop the airplane he added right rudder input causing the airplane to veer to the right. The airplane went off the end of the runway into sand causing the nose landing gear to collapse. After coming to rest he ordered an emergency evacuation, and secured the engines. PROBABLE CAUSE: The failure of a spring inside the No. 2 brakeÂs upper brake control valve and the fracture of the coupling subassembly of the No. 1 wheel speed sensor during landing, which resulted in the loss of braking action, and the pilot-in-commandÂs (PIC) deactivation of the antiskid system even though there were no antiskid failure annunciations, which resulted in the rupture of the Nos. 1, 3, and 4 tires, further loss of braking action, and subsequent landing overrun. Contributing to accident were the PICÂs improper landing flare, which resulted in landing several hundred feet beyond the aiming point marking, and his unsuccessful attempts to deploy the thrust reversers for reasons that could not be determined because postaccident operational testing did not reveal any anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. Contributing to the passengerÂs injury was his leaving his seat intentionally while the airplane was in motion.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA15LA140 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Marco Island Airport, FL (MRK); March 2015; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Marco Island Airport, FL (MRK); March 2015; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Marco Island Airport, FL (MRK); March 2015; (publicdomain) photo (c) Mike Demulling; Marco Island Airport, FL (MRK); 08 December 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) Mike Demulling; Marco Island Airport, FL (MRK); 08 December 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; March 2015; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Flight TK726 was a regular passenger service from Istanbul-AtatÃ¼rk International Airport (IST) to Kathmandu, Nepal. The flight was the first international flight to scheduled to arrive that morning. After descending from cruising altitude, it entered a holding pattern at FL210 at 06:12 hours local time (00:27 UTC) until about 07:00 (01:15 UTC) when it was cleared for a VOR/DME approach to runway 02. This approach was abandoned at about the Missed Approach Point at 1DME and the aircraft performed a go around. The aircraft circled and positioned for a second approach to runway 02. The aircraft touched down to the left of the runway centerline with the left hand main gear off the paved runway surface. It ran onto soft soil and the nose landing gear collapsed. The aircraft touched down at to the left of the centerline because the FMGS NAV database contained threshold coordinates for a proposed displacement of the runway 02 threshold. This was later withdrawn through a NOTAM, but had not been updated by the airline in the FMGS. Additionally, the coordinates that were initially published were inaccurate, causing the threshold coordinates to be offset to the left of the actual threshold. This had been noticed and reported by a previous Turkish Airlines flight on March 2. The changes to the FMGS had not been performed by the time TC-JOC landed at Kathmandu. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The decision of the flight crew to continue approach and landing below the minima with inadequate visual reference and not to perform a missed approach in accordance to the published approach procedure.

The 2 pilots, 3 flight attendants, and 98 of the 127 passengers were not injured; the other 29 passengers received minor injuries. The airplane was substantially damaged.  Flight 1086 was a regularly scheduled passenger flight from Atlanta-Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Georgia, where it departed at 09:23 hours local time.  Given the winter weather conditions at LaGuardia, the flight crew was concerned about the available landing distance on runway 13 (7003 ft / 2135 m). While en route to LGA they spent considerable time analyzing the airplaneÂs stopping performance. The flight crew also requested braking action reports about 45 and 35 minutes before landing, but none were available at those times because of runway snow clearing operations. The unavailability of braking actions reports and the uncertainty about the runwayÂs condition created some situational stress for the captain, who was the pilot flying. After runway 13 became available for arriving airplanes, the flight crews of two preceding airplanes (which landed on the runway about 16 and 8 minutes before the accident landing) reported good braking action on the runway, so the flight crew expected to see at least some of the runwayÂs surface after the airplane broke out of the clouds. However, the flight crew saw that the runway was covered with snow, which was inconsistent with their expectations based on the braking action reports and the snow clearing operations that had concluded less than 30 minutes before the airplane landed. The snowier-than-expected runway, along with the relatively short runway length and the presence of Flushing Bay directly off the departure end of the runway, most likely increased the captainÂs concerns about his ability to stop the airplane within the available runway distance, which exacerbated his situational stress.  The captain made a relatively aggressive reverse thrust input almost immediately after touchdown. Both pilots were aware that 1.3 EPR was the target setting for contaminated runways. As reverse thrust EPR was rapidly increasing, the captainÂs attention was focused on other aspects of the landing, which included steering the airplane to counteract a slide to the left and ensuring that the spoilers had deployed, which was a necessary action for the autobrakes to engage. The maximum EPR values reached during the landing were 2.07 on the left engine and 1.91 on the right engine, which were much higher than the target setting of 1.3 EPR. These high EPR values likely resulted from a combination of the captainÂs stress; his relatively aggressive reverse thrust input; and operational distractions, including the airplaneÂs continued slide to the left despite the captainÂs efforts to steer it away from the snowbanks alongside the runway. All of these factors reduced the captainÂs monitoring of EPR indications. The high EPR values caused rudder blanking, which occurs on MD-80 series airplanes when smooth airflow over the rudder is disrupted by high reverse thrust, and a subsequent loss of aerodynamic directional control. Although the captain stowed the thrust reversers and applied substantial right rudder, right nosewheel steering, and right manual braking, the airplaneÂs departure from the left side of the runway could not be avoided because directional control was regained too late to be effective. The airplane departed the left side of runway 13 about 3,000 feet from the approach end of the runway. The tracks were on a heading of about 10 degrees from the runway heading. About 4,100 feet from the approach end of the runway, the airplanes left wing initially struck the airportÂs perimeter fence, which is located on top of the berm, and the airplane tracks turn back parallel with runway 13. About 5,000 feet from the approach end of the runway, the airplane came to rest with its nose over the berm. The left wing of the airplane destroyed about 940 feet of the perimeter fence. PROBABLE CAUSE: The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the captainÂs inability to maintain directional control of the airplane due to his application of excessive reverse thrust, which degraded the effectiveness of the rudder in controlling the airplaneÂs heading. Contributing to the accident were the captainÂs (1) situational stress resulting from his concern about stopping performance and (2) attentional limitations due to the high workload during the landing, which prevented him from immediately recognizing the use of excessive reverse thrust.METAR: 15:24 UTC / 10:24 local time: KLGA 051524Z 04007KT 1/4SM R04/2600V2800FT SN FZFG VV009 M03/M04 A3013 RMK AO2 P000415:51 UTC / 10:51 local time: KLGA 051551Z 01008KT 1/4SM R04/2800V3500FT SN FZFG VV009 M03/M05 A3012 RMK AO2 SLP199 P0006 T1033105016:22 UTC / 11:22 local time: KLGA 051622Z 01008KT 1/4SM R04/3000VP6000FT SN FZFG VV011 M03/M05 A3012 RMK AO2 SFC VIS 1/2 P0003Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NTSB/AAR-16/02 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  Flightradar24  Liveatc.net   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; New York-La Guardia Airport, NY (LGA); 05 March 2015; (publicdomain) photo (c) Sergio Cardona; New York-La Guardia Airport, NY (LGA); 05 March 2015 photo (c) NTSB; New York-La Guardia Airport, NY (LGA); March 2015; (publicdomain) photo (c) Leonard J.

The aircraft operated flight SG1085 from Bangalore to Hubli and departed at around 13:00 UTC. At the time the visibility reported for Hubli was 10 km.  When the aircraft came in contact with Mangalore ATC, the controller cleared the aircraft direct to Hubli and informed heavy rains and thunder showers over Hubli with visibility 3000 m. At around 60 nm from Hubli, the weather reported was heavy rain and visibility 4000 meters. ATC cleared aircraft for the NDB approach runway 26, however the captain preferred to carry out a VOR/DME trial procedure for runway 26. The descent was commenced and about 25 nm short of Hubli, ATC again advised visibility has reduced to 3000 m due heavy rain and thunderstorm. Thereafter the crew decided to hold over Hubli until the weather improves. Twenty minutes into holding, ATC again informed that visibility has improved to 4000 m in moderate rain. Subsequently descent was requested by the pilot for runway 26. The captain stated that he had established visual reference with runway at about 6 nm on the final approach course. The crew also selected wipers on short final to have a better visibility. The aircraft landed normally.  The captain stated that after touch down and reducing power, he was concentrating on the far end of the runway. As the runway was wet, he did not realize that the aircraft was drifting to the left of the center line. He further mentioned that he selected full reverse on both the engines to maintain the aircraft on the center line however the aircraft veered toward the left side of the runway and in the process overran the runway edge light, after which the left main landing gear collapsed. The propeller blades hit the runway surface and sheared off from the root attachment. The captain maneuvered the aircraft however the nose wheel tyre failed under over load conditions and the nose landing gear collapsed as well.  Subsequently, the aircraft exited the runway on the left side on kutcha (dried mud) and came to a final stop at round 52 meters away from the runway center line. The cockpit crew shut down the engines and the electrical power supply and cockpit door and announced evacuation. The cabin crew opened and the cabin doors on the right for evacuation.  There was no injury to any of the occupants on board the aircraft. There was no postaccident fire. Probable cause of the accident: Loss of visual cues after touch down in inclemental weather conditions resulted in veering of the aircraft towards left of the centerline leading to runway excursion and accident. Following are the contributory factors. 1. Inappropriate handling technique of the aircraft controls by the PIC to maintain the directional control of the aircraft after landing. 2. Non-standards callouts by the first officer to correct situation after landing. 3. Impact of the landing gear with the non-frangible erected runway edge light resulted in retraction of the same. 4. At the time of the accident DGCA O.M. No. AV.15026/006/92- AS dated 3rd February 1992 was in force, which dictated examiners and instructors of the operators only to carry out trial procedures in VMC and during Daytime only. M/s Spice jet instructions to the flight crew did not reflect the same and allowed flight crew with less experience & below VMC flight conditions to carry out trial procedures.

The pilot, the sole occupant on board, was not injured, and the airplane sustained substantial damage.  Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident, and an instrument flight rules flight plan had been filed. The flight originated from Lansing-Capital City Airport (LAN), Michigan and was destined for Muskegon County Airport. According to the pilot he flew the approach to minimums, saw the approach lights and saw he was right of the runway. As he maneuvered to realign the airplane with the runway, he struck the approach lights. After landing, he examined the airplane and found the left horizontal stabilizer hanging down. There were numerous dents on the leading edge of the left wing strut, and the left landing gear was bent. Effective at the time of this accident was a permanent Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) associated with the ILS runway 24 approach prohibiting a coupled autopilot approach from 1150 feet mean seal level to the surface. During a post-accident interview the pilot stated he was unaware of this NOTAM. The NOTAM had been in effect since February 21st, 2014 and the approach chart used did not note this approach restriction.

The co-pilot performed the external checks; this included checking the fluid level in the hydraulic reservoir. The aircraft was refuelled to 3,000 lb and, after the passengers boarded, it departed for Blackpool. The commander was the pilot flying (PF). The takeoff and cruise to Blackpool were uneventful.  The commander planned and briefed for the NDB approach to runway 10, which was to be flown with the autopilot engaged. Whilst descending through FL120, the left, followed by the right, hydraulic low pressure cautions illuminated. Upon checking the hydraulic pressure gauge, the pressure was noted to be Âcycling up and downÂ, but for the majority of the time it indicated about 2,800 psi (in the green arc). During this time the hydraulic low pressure cautions went on and off irregularly, with the left caution being on more often than the right. The co-pilot then actioned the ÂHYDRAULIC SYSTEM - HYDRAULIC PUMP FAILUREÂ checklist. It stated that if the hydraulic pressure was a minimum of 2,800 psi, the flight could be continued. Just before the aircraft reached the Blackpool NDB, the commander commented ""itÂs dropping"", but he could not recall what he was referring to. This was followed by the roll fail and speed brk [brake] fail caution messages illuminating. The co-pilot then actioned the applicable checklists. These stated that the Landing Distances Required (LDR) would increase by approximately 65% and 21%, respectively. As the roll fail LDR increase was greater than that of the speed brk fail, the crew used an LDR increase of 65% which the co-pilot equated to 5,950 ft. Runway 10 at Blackpool has an LDA of 6,131 ft, therefore they elected to continue to Blackpool. The roll fail checklist stated that a ÂFLAPS UPÂ landing was required. The co-pilot then calculated the VREF of 132 kt, including a 20 kt increment, as stipulated by the ÂFLAPS UP, 10, OR 20 APPROACH AND LANDINGÂ checklist. The commander then continued with the approach. At about 4 nm on final approach the co-pilot lowered the landing gear, in response to the commanderÂs request. About 8 seconds later the commander said ""just lost it all""; referring to the general state of the aircraft. This was followed almost immediately by the landing gear unsafe aural warning, as the main landing gear was not indicating down and locked. Whilst descending through 1,000 ft, at just over 3 nm from the threshold, the commander asked the co-pilot to action the ÂALTERNATE GEAR EXTENSIONÂ checklist. The commander then discontinued the approach by selecting ALT HOLD, increased engine thrust and selected a 500 ft/min rate of climb on the autopilot. However, a few seconds later, before the co-pilot could action the checklist, the main gear indicated down and locked. The commander disconnected the autopilot and continued the approach. The crew did not consider reviewing the ÂHYDRAULIC SYSTEM - HYDRAULIC PUMP FAILUREÂ checklist as they had not recognised the symptoms of loss of hydraulic pressure. When ATC issued the aircraft its landing clearance the wind was from 140Â° at 17 kt. This equated to a headwind component of about 10 kt and a crosswind of about 12 kt. As the aircraft descended through 500 ft (the Minimum Descent Altitude (MDA) for the approach) at 1.5 nm from the threshold, the commander instructed the co-pilot to advise ATC that they had a hydraulic problem and to request the RFFS to be put on standby. There was a slight delay in transmitting this request, due to another aircraft on frequency, but the request was acknowledged by ATC. The aircraft touched down about 1,500 ft from the start of the paved surface at an airspeed of 132 kt and a groundspeed of 124 kt. When the commander applied the toe (power) brakes he felt no significant retardation. During the landing roll no attempt was made to apply the emergency brakes, as required in the event of a power brake failure. The co-pilot asked if he should try to operate the lift dump, but it failed to function, due to the lack of hydraulic pressure. At some point, while the aircraft was on the runway, the co-pilot transmitted a MAYDAY call to ATC. When an overrun appeared likely, the commander shut down the engines. The aircraft subsequently overran the end of the runway at a groundspeed of about 80 kt. The commander later commented that he was in a ""state of panic"" during the landing roll and was unsure whether or not he had applied the emergency brake. As the aircraft left the paved surface the commander steered the aircraft slightly right to avoid a shallow downslope to the left of runwayÂs extended centreline. The aircraft continued across the rough, uneven ground, during which the nose gear collapsed and the wing to fuselage attachments were severely damaged. Once it had come to a stop, he shut down the remaining aircraft systems. The passengers and crew, who were uninjured, vacated the aircraft via the entry/exit door and moved upwind to a safe distance. The investigation determined that, irrespective of the omission to apply the emergency brakes, the Landing Distance Available (LDA) at Blackpool was insufficient for the aircraft to land with a hydraulic failure.  A fatigue crack in the port cap1 of the left hydraulic pump had caused a hydraulic leak which eventually resulted in the total loss of the hydraulic system.METAR: 11:50 UTC / 11:50 local time: EGNH 121150Z 15021KT 9000 FEW024 11/08 Q102012:20 UTC / 12:20 local time: EGNH 121220Z 14018KT 9000 FEW024 12/08 Q1020Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: EW/C2015/03/01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) Steve; Blackpool Airport (BLK); 13 March 2015 photo (c) AAIB; Blackpool Airport (BLK); March 2015 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Purpose of the flight was to carry out flight inspections to confirm the required performance of aeronautical navigation facilities. The captain was Pilot Flying. While the aircraft was flying south-southwest on Airway V31 toward the Niigata VORTAC at an altitude 9,000 ft, the captain and the first officer sighted a lower layer of clouds but had visually confirmed that there was no cloud on the flight route in the vicinity of Niigata Airport. At about 14:32, the aircraft commenced a descending turn from right above Niigata Airport in order to inspect on the next airway. At this time, the captain and the first officer had checked on an indication on the weather radar display of the aircraft showing a precipitation area, albeit not on their route, and were therefore focusing attention in that direction. They then encountered scattered thin clouds, but this was judged not to be thick clouds which might lead to turbulence or thunder. At about 14:35, as the aircraft entered the thin cloud at an altitude about 6,500 ft, a very loud noise was heard on the radio equipment while the captain, the first officer and the onboard maintenance engineer were listening to it. After three to four seconds, the captain and the first officer received an impact accompanied by a loud popping noise, together with a strong flash from the front of the aircraft. While continuing the flight, the captain and the first officer checked the instruments to check whether abnormality had occurred to the aircraft; consequently, they confirmed that discoloration was found on some of the cockpit instrument displays, and that the airborne DME (Distance Measuring Equipment) display on the captain's side had disappeared. However, there was no abnormality in the DME display on the first officer's side and there was no problem with the visibility of the discolored instrument displays; accordingly, they judged there to be no serious abnormality which would affect the flight. The captain, the first officer and the onboard maintenance engineer discussed whether they should continue the flight inspection, and although there was thought to be no hindrance to the flight, they decided to suspend the flight and return to the base of the aircraft at Tokyo International Airport, because they could not confirm damage to the airframe while on board. Thereafter the aircraft landed at Tokyo International Airport at 15:26. On the post-flight inspection, damage was confirmed to the left front fuselage outer skins, the front lower fuselage and the left horizontal stabilizer. PROBABLE CAUSES: ""It is probable that this accident occurred because the aircraft sustained damage to the outer skins of its left front lower fuselage as a result of being struck by lightning to the airframe in flight. It is probable that the lightning strike was occurred because the aircraft came close to the electrically charged cumulus clouds in the scattered thin cloud where it was difficult to predict lightning.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JTSB Report number: AA2016-9 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) JTSB; Tokyo-Haneda Airport (HND/RJTT); March 2015 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight was a regular passenger service from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to Melbourne. The flight crew consisted of a captain, who was the pilot flying (PF) and a first officer, who was pilot monitoring (PM). The approach to runway 34 at Melbourne airport was not equipped with an Instrument Landing System (ILS), so a non-precision approach was performed, aided by PAPI lights.  Flight data showed that the PF disengaged the autopilot at approximately 700 feet above ground level (AGL) and from that point until touchdown there was an increase in the frequency and magnitude of sidestick pitch control inputs by the PF. In response to these inputs the aircraftÂs autothrottle system varied the engine thrust to maintain a target speed, as per system design, and the aircraft pitch angles fluctuated between approximately -0.5Â° nose down and +5.0Â° nose up. The net result of the varying thrust settings and pitch angles was a fluctuating rate of descent between approximately 380 and 960 feet per minute. Large sidestick inputs, specifically nose-down, also have the potential to inhibit the vertical speed reduction function, which is an automated function that provides some protection against touchdown at very high vertical speeds. As the aircraft passed 300 feet a rate of descent of 960 feet per minute was recorded. This neared the operatorÂs maximum stabilised approach limit of 1000 feet per minute when below 500 feet AGL. As well as a high rate of descent, actual exceedances of the operatorÂs stabilisation criteria included: large changes to pitch inputted by the pilot flying, including negative pitch values, fluctuations in the rate of descent over a large range that were abnormal for the phase of flight, incorrect glide path.  From approximately 250 feet AGL, the aircraft was trending low and continuing below the glide path. At this point the pilots would have been able to observe 3 red lights and one white light on the PAPI. This trend was allowed to continue until the aircraft was well below the desired glide path to the extent that the PAPI would have indicated 4 red lights from approximately 125 feet AGL. From this point the PF made numerous pitch commands which were mostly nose down. These included a full range nose down deflection at 24 feet AGL. The company procedures and manufacturerÂs recommendations dictated that if an approach becomes unstable below 500 feet AGL, a go-around must be initiated by the pilot flying (PF) and/or the pilot monitoring (PM) must alert the PF of the unstable approach and encourage a go-around. At 60 feet AGL the captain moved the thrust levers forward momentarily into the TOGA (Take-off/Go Around) detent. The captain stated that this was done in response to a feeling that the aircraft was sinking below the path, and the intention was to reduce this sink by applying more thrust to the engines. The placement of the thrust lever into TOGA placed the aircraft automation into the go-around autopilot modes and changed the display on the primary flight display flight mode annunciator (FMA). The captain subsequently reduced the thrust levers. The PM, on seeing the modes on the FMA change assumed that a go-around was being conducted and awaited further announcement from the captain. The PM reported noticing the thrust levers reducing and that the aircraft was not flaring and applied nose up input to the sidestick at the same time as the PF. At the time of the occurrence there was no procedure on the A330 for the use of manual thrust for this purpose. Prior to 2009, a procedure existed in the Airbus A330 documentation that allowed a specific use of manual thrust in difficult environmental conditions. Airbus advised that after an analysis of in-service events the procedure was removed from all operational documents.  Manipulation of the thrust levers in this manner had the effect of disengaging the autothrottle thereby inhibiting some of the available auto flight system protections including the target speed function (which automatically maintained the desired speed and adjusted for fluctuation in the wind), and the vertical speed reduction function. It also caused a pitch up tendency which usually requires a large nose down input by the pilot flying to prevent the aircraft from pitching up. At this stage in the approach applying large nose down inputs differed from the gradual nose up input normally required to complete the flare. Furthermore, it resulted in breaking down of the shared mental model between the pilot flying and pilot monitoring in that the pilot monitoring believed the advancement of the thrust levers was the initiation of a go-around. Shortly after this action, the aircraft touched down at a vertical speed of approximately 700 feet per minute and a vertical acceleration of 2.61 G was recorded. The aircraft also touched down at approximately 170m (560 feet) from the landing threshold, short of the normal touchdown zone of between 304m (1000 feet) and 609m (2000 feet). The manufacturer of the aircraft produced a complete load analysis of the event based on recorded flight data provided by the operator. The conclusion of this analysis was that several components in the left and right gear had ""exceeded their design load limits and may have been detrimentally overloaded"". There were no injuries reported as a result of the hard landing. The airplane remained at Melbourne until March 26, when it was ferried at low altitude to Darwin, Australia, and continuing to Kuala Lumpur the next day for further repairs. Contributing factors: - The final approach became unstable at around 300 feet above the ground due to the control inputs from the captain. - Inadequate monitoring and communication by the crew led to a lack of recognition of the undesirable flight state and the continuation of an unstable approach. - Continuation of the unstable approach led to a high rate of descent at touchdown and resulted in a hard landing in excess of the aircraft design loads and short of the normal touchdown area. Other safety factors: The captain used an unapproved manual thrust procedure in an attempt to recover the approachMETAR: 20:30 UTC / 07:30 local time: YMML 132030Z 36012KT CAVOK 11/07 Q1016 NOSIG21:00 UTC / 08:00 local time: YMML 132100Z 36015KT CAVOK 12/07 Q1016 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: ATSB Report number: AO-2015-032 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources: ATSB   Location  Images: photo (c) Flightaware.com; Melbourne-Tullamarine Airport, VIC (MEL); 14 March 2015 photo (c) ATSB; Melbourne-Tullamarine Airport, VIC (MEL); 14 March 2015; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The force landing was a result of a loss of engine power during an en route climb. The pilot received minor injuries and the passenger was not injured. The airplane was substantially damaged. The aircraft was owned and operated by the pilot as post maintenance test flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight. The flight originated from the Tulsa International Airport, Oklahoma, at 15:00. The airplane was equipped with a Honeywell TPE331 engine which had been installed about 9 flight hours prior to the accident. The pilot stated they were climbing to 11,000 feet when he noticed a decrease in engine torque with a steady exhaust gas temperature (EGT). As the torque started to drop even more, the EGT also began to decrease. The pilot attempted to fly to a nearby airstrip, but was unable to maintain sufficient altitude. He then chose a field in which to land. Shortly after touching down, the airplane contacted trees, completely severing the left wing from the fuselage and partially severing the right wing from the fuselage. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The fuel pump gear manufacturerÂs allowance of set-up gears made from a nonconforming material to be put in the production inventory system, the installation of a nonconforming gear in the accident airplaneÂs production fuel pump, and the gearÂs failure, which resulted in a loss of fuel flow to the engine and the subsequent loss of engine power.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN15LA180 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NewsOn6  NTSB   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All 144 passengers and six crew members were killed. Flight 4U9525 departed Barcelona, Spain at 10:00 hours local time (09:00 UTC) on a regular passenger service to DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany. The flight reached its cruising altitude of FL380 at 10:27 hours. At 10:30 hours the flight was cleared direct to the IRMAR waypoint, which was confirmed by the flight: ""Direct IRMAR, Merci 18G."" This was the last radio contact with the flight. At 10:30:08, the captain told the co-pilot that he was leaving the cockpit and asked him to take over radio communications, which the co-pilot acknowledged. At 10:30:53, the selected altitude on the Flight Control Unit (FCU) changed in from 38,000 ft to 100 ft. One second later, the autopilot changed to OPEN DES mode and autothrust changed to THR IDLE mode. The airplane started to descend and both engines' speed decreased. At 10:33:12, the speed management changed from managed mode to selected mode. One second later, the selected target speed became 308 kt while the aeroplane's speed was 273 kt. The aeroplane's speed started to increase along with the descent rate, which subsequently varied between 1,700 ft/min and 5,000 ft/min, then was on average about 3,500 ft/min. The selected speed decreased to 288 kt. Then, over the following 13 seconds, the value of this target speed changed six times until it reached 302 kt.  At 10:33:47, the controller asked the flight crew what cruise level they were cleared for. The airplane was then at an altitude of 30,000 ft in descent. There was no answer from the co-pilot. Over the following 30 seconds, the controller tried to contact the flight crew again on two occasions, without any answer. Thereafter the selected speed increased up to 323 kt. Then the buzzer to request access to the cockpit sounded, but the copilot did not react. Marseille control centre kept attempting to contact the flight, without any response. The selected speed was again increased, this time to 350 kt. Meanwhile the captain attempted to call the copilot over the interphone and there were noises similar to a person knocking on the cockpit door. At the same time Marseille control and a controller from the French Air Defence system called the flight at various frequencies, without success. As the aircraft kept descending noises similar to violent blows on the cockpit door were recorded on five occasions between 10:39:30 and 10:40:28. The GPWS then sounded: ""Terrain, Terrain, Pull Up, Pull Up"" until the aircraft impacted a sloping rocky ravine in mountainous terrain at an elevation of 1550 meters. Causes: The collision with the ground was due to the deliberate and planned action of the co-pilot who decided to commit suicide while alone in the cockpit. The process for medical certification of pilots, in particular self-reporting in case of decrease in medical fitness between two periodic medical evaluations, did not succeed in preventing the co-pilot, who was experiencing mental disorder with psychotic symptoms, from exercising the privilege of his licence. The following factors may have contributed to the failure of this principle: - the co-pilot's probable fear of losing his ability to fly as a professional pilot if he had reported his decrease in medical fitness to an AME; - the potential financial consequences generated by the lack of specific insurance covering the risks of loss of income in case of unfitness to fly; - the lack of clear guidelines in German regulations on when a threat to public safety outweighs the requirements of medical confidentiality. Security requirements led to cockpit doors designed to resist forcible intrusion by unauthorized persons. This made it impossible to enter the flight compartment before the aircraft impacted the terrain in the French Alps.METAR: 08:30 UTC / 09:30 local time: LEBL 240830Z 05012KT 9000 -RA FEW020 SCT027 BKN045 12/10 Q1006 NOSIG09:00 UTC / 10:00 local time: LEBL 240900Z 05016KT 9999 FEW020 BKN045 12/10 Q1006 RERA NOSIGBarcelona Airport weather during takeoff: Wind 050 degrees at 16 knots; 10+ km visibility; few clouds at 2000 feet; broken clouds at 4500 feet; 12Â°C; dew point 10Â°C; Recent moderate/heavy rain09:30 UTC / 10:30 local time: LFML 240930Z 24006KT CAVOK 15/09 Q1008 NOSIGMarseille Airport weather: wind 240 degrees at 6 knots; 15Â°C, dew point 9Â°; CAVOK09:30 UTC / 10:30 local time: LEBL 240930Z 05015KT 8000 -RA FEW020 BKN045 13/11 Q1006 NOSIG10:00 UTC / 11:00 local time: LFML 241000Z 27005KT 9999 FEW033 BKN210 16/08 Q1008 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Report number: BEA2015-0125 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: List of aircraft accidents and incidents intentionally caused by pilots  Flightradar24  Task Force on Measures Following the Accident of Germanwings Flight 9525 / EASA, 17 July 2015  SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) Bureau d`EnquÃªtes et d`Analyses (BEA, France, www.bea.aero); near Barcelonette; 25 March 2015 photo (c) Flightradar24/Aviation Safety Network; near Barcelonette; 24 March 2015 photo (c) Bureau d`EnquÃªtes et d`Analyses (BEA, France, www.bea.aero); near Barcelonette photo (c) Bureau d`EnquÃªtes et d`Analyses (BEA, France, www.bea.aero); near Barcelonette photo (c) Bureau d`EnquÃªtes et d`Analyses (BEA, France, www.bea.aero); near Barcelonette; 25 March 2015 photo (c) Bureau d`EnquÃªtes et d`Analyses (BEA, France, www.bea.aero); near Barcelonette; 25 March 2015 photo (c) Bureau d`EnquÃªtes et d`Analyses (BEA, France, www.bea.aero); April 2015 photo (c) Bureau d`EnquÃªtes et d`Analyses (BEA, France, www.bea.aero); April 2015 photo (c) Bureau d`EnquÃªtes et d`Analyses (BEA, France, www.bea.aero); April 2015 photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Palma de Mallorca Airport (PMI/LEPA); 13 October 2014 photo (c) Jan MÃ¼nster; Hamburg-FuhlsbÃ¼ttel Airport (HAM/EDDH); 10 March 2015 photo (c) Timo Blossfeld; Berlin-Tegel Airport (TXL/EDDT); 29 March 2014 photo (c) Miklos SZABO; Wien-Schwechat International Airport (VIE/LOWW); 23 August 2013 photo (c) Gerhard Plomitzer; MÃ¼nchen-Franz Josef Strauss Airport (MUC/EDDM); 08 October 2010 photo (c) Stanley Page; London-Heathrow Airport (LHR/EGLL); 21 February 2015 photo (c) Giorgio Parolini; Milano-Malpensa Airport (MXP/LIMC); 02 September 2014 photo (c) RenÃ© Verschuur; BarcelonaâEl Prat Airport (BCN/LEBL); 09 August 2014 photo (c) Markus Schauhuber; Wien-Schwechat International Airport (VIE/LOWW); 20 March 2015 photo (c) Markus Schauhuber; Wien-Schwechat International Airport (VIE/LOWW); 20 March 2015 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates08-Jan-2025 19:05 ASN Updated [Departure airport, Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane sustained substantial damage. 23 occupants were injured. Flight 624 departed from Toronto at 21:05 hours local time (01:05 UTC). At 23:40 hours local time (02:40 UTC) the aircraft entered a holding pattern to the west of Halifax. Visibility was limited due to snowfall.  The aircraft was then cleared for a Localizer (LOC-Z) approach to runway 05 at Halifax Airport. During final approach the aircraft severed powerlines located 250 m from the beginning of the paved surface of runway 05. The aircraft then impacted a localizer antenna array, located 70 m further on, and became airborne again. The Airbus slid onto the runway and came to rest near taxiway B. The nose cone was ripped off in the accident sequence and pieces of the antenna array were embedded in the nose of plane. Part of the undercarriage were sheared off and both engines separated. There was extensive damage to both wing leading edges and horizontal stabilizers and lower fuselage. The last flight landing at Halifax before the accident was AC118, an Embraer 190 from Ottawa, at 21:50 hours local time. Two other incoming flights diverted and two were cancelled. Findings as to causes and contributing factors: 1. Air Canada's standard operating procedure (SOP) and practice when flying in flight path angle guidance mode was that, once the aircraft was past the final approach fix, the flight crews were not required to monitor the aircraft's altitude and distance from the threshold or to make any adjustments to the flight path angle. This practice was not in accordance with the flight crew operating manuals of Air Canada or Airbus. 2. As per Air Canada's practice, once the flight path angle was selected and the aircraft began to descend, the flight crew did not monitor the altitude and distance from the threshold, nor did they make any adjustments to the flight path angle. 3. The flight crew did not notice that the aircraft had drifted below and diverged from the planned vertical descent angle flight profile, nor were they aware that the aircraft had crossed the minimum descent altitude further back from the threshold. 4. Considering the challenging conditions to acquire and maintain the visual cues, it is likely the flight crew delayed disconnecting the autopilot until beyond the minimum descent altitude because of their reliance on the autopilot system. 5. The approach and runway lights were not changed from setting 4 to setting 5; therefore, these lights were not at their maximum brightness setting during the approach. 6. The system to control the airfield lighting's preset selections for brightness setting 4 was not in accordance with the NAV CANADA Air Traffic Control Manual of Operations requirement for the omnidirectional approach lighting system to be at its brightest settings. 7. The limited number of visual cues and the short time that they were available to the flight crew, combined with potential visual illusions and the reduced brightness of the approach and runway lights, diminished the flight crew's ability to detect that the aircraft's approach path was taking it short of the runway. 8. The flight crew's recognition that the aircraft was too low during the approach would have been delayed because of plan continuation bias. 9. The aircraft struck terrain approximately 740 feet short of the runway threshold, bounced twice, and then slid along the runway before coming to a rest approximately 1900 feet beyond the runway threshold. 10. At some time during the impact sequence, the captain's head struck the glare shield because there were insufficient acceleration forces to lock the shoulder harness and prevent movement of his upper body. 11. The first officer sustained a head injury and serious injury to the right eye as a result of striking the glare shield because the automatic locking feature of the right-side shoulder-harness inertia reel was unserviceable. 12. A flight attendant was injured by a coffee brewer that came free of its mounting base because its locking system was not correctly engaged. 13. Because no emergency was expected, the passengers and cabin crew were not in a brace position at the time of the initial impact. 14.

The accident is classified as a technical failure of the No. 4 wheel tire, a result of the aging process of the tire that resulted in the weakening of the ""insole reinforcement layer"" and the separation of the insole from the reinforcement layer, during the take-off run. The failure of wheel tire No. 4 started at a relatively high speed of a heavy plane and it created a chain process of load on the other wheels and high heat. Wheels 3 and 4 failed respectively (the fuses melted), due to the increase in temperature inside the tire and the air was released to prevent the tire from exploding.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIAI Report number: 33-15 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilots were not injured. The airplane was operated by a private company. Day, visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and an instrument flight rules flight plan was filed. The flight originated at Caracas-SimÃ³n BolÃ­var International Airport, Venezuela about 16:30. The pilot reported that the purpose of the flight was to fly the airplane to FXE for scheduled maintenance. About 2 hours and 15 minutes after departure, at flight level 430, the crew observed a red warning light indicating a maximum cabin differential pressure of 9.8 psi, followed by a red ""DOOR MAIN"" indication. The pilots donned oxygen masks and referenced the airplane's quick reference handbook. A loud ""bam"" sound was then heard in the cabin and the crew initiated an immediate descent. The cabin pressure outflow valve was opened manually and the airplane was leveled at 12,000 feet above mean sea level. The flight continued to FXE unpressurized and landed without further incident. After landing, the crew performed a walk-around inspection and found no obvious anomalies with the airplane. A subsequent inspection of the airplane by maintenance and engineering personnel revealed structural airframe damage, including a cracked floor beam, dimpled areas in the floor boards, damaged structure between ribs, and damaged wing links. An initial examination of the fuselage revealed that the outflow valve safety port, located on the outer fuselage, was completely plugged with a foreign material resembling dried dirt from a mud dauber. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The in-flight failure of the cabin pressurization relief/safety valve (CPRV) due to an obstruction of the CPRV static port, which allowed the airplane to overpressurize.

On the morning of the occurrence, CA66's first officer arrived at the airport at approximately 06:00. The first officer appeared to be in good spirits and spent about 5 minutes in the flight planning room before going to the aircraft to prepare it for that day's flights. The captain arrived at approximately 06:15 and went directly to the flight planning room to begin preparing the morning's flight plan. He appeared to be in a positive state of mind and spent a few minutes speaking with other company pilots who were also preparing to operate flights. He used a company computer to access weather information and placed a telephone call to NAV CANADA to file an instrument flight rules flight plan. No abnormal behaviour was observed by anyone with whom he had contact. The captain then walked to the aircraft and spent about 10 minutes in the flight deck before assisting the first officer with loading the flight's cargo. Final flight preparations were carried out by both flight crew members before they boarded the aircraft and started the engines, at about 06:45. At 07:03, CA66 began its take-off run. The aircraft lifted off after an approximate ground-run distance of 2800 to 3000 feet. This was within the expected normal performance for the aircraft type. Shortly after takeoff, CA66 contacted CYVR terminal departure control and was cleared to 9000 feet above sea level (ASL). A short time later, the air traffic controller assigned the flight a northbound heading. At 07:07, CYVR terminal departure control instructed CA66 to change radio frequencies and contact CYVR centre control. Upon initial contact with CYVR centre control, while climbing through 7500 feet, CA66 was again cleared to the aircraft's final flight planned altitude of flight level 200. At 07:08, the crew acknowledged a clearance to climb to flight level 200; this was CA66's last radio transmission. One minute and 20 seconds later, while climbing through an altitude of 8700 feet on an assigned heading of 350Â° magnetic, the aircraft disappeared from secondary surveillance radar displays at air traffic control. CA66's radar track, from the time it first became visible on radar at 07:02 until a steep descent toward ground, was approximately 7 minutes. The track showed an apparently routine climb from CYVR, at an average climb rate of 1500 feet per minute. Aircraft speed during the climb increased gradually until a ground speed of approximately 185 knots was reached. The last 3 radar returns from CA66 showed the aircraft beginning an abrupt, steep descent. At 07:09, a radar return showed that the aircraft was at 8700 feet; this was the highest altitude it reached. The 2 subsequent radar returns showed that the aircraft had dropped rapidly to 7600 feet and then 5000 feet while continuing in the direction of flight. There were no further returns. During the initial stage of the descent, the aircraft pitched down at about 6Â° per second, and its vertical acceleration reached -0.6g. The descent to 5000 feet likely occurred within 10 to 14 seconds. During that period, the aircraft's descent rate exceeded 30 000 feet per minute, and aerodynamic forces caused structural disintegration of the aircraft (in-flight breakup). There was no Mayday call or other communication from the aircraft during this period. Deteriorating weather conditions with low cloud and heavy snowfall hampered an air search; however, aircraft wreckage was found on steep, mountainous, snow-covered terrain by ground searchers at approximately 16:45. Both pilots had been fatally injured. Investigation showed that the captain had 0.24% blood alcohol content [BAC]. To obtain this, the captain would have had to consume approximately 17 to 20 standard drinks over a 12-hour period.  An autopsy also identified focal severe coronary artery atherosclerosis and both steatosis and hepatitis in the captainÂs liver. Finding these conditions in a 34-year-old person suggests excessive alcohol consumption over a significant period. The captain had recently applied for the position of Vancouver base chief pilot for the companyÂs cargo operation. On 26 March 2015, the company advised him that the position had been awarded to another candidate. Around the same period, on 24 March 2015, 20 days before this accident, a first officer who had been having symptoms of depression and psychosis deliberately flew a Germanwings Airbus A320 into terrain, killing all on board. Although there were several coincidental factors, the investigation could not make any conclusions about the captainÂs predisposition to committing an intentional act. Other scenario's like pitot system blockage or crew incapacitation were also considered, but deemed not very probable. Findings as to causes and contributing factors: 1. For unknown reasons, the aircraft descended in the direction of flight at high speed until it exceeded its structural limits, leading to an in-flight breakup. 2. Based on the captain's blood alcohol content, alcohol intoxication almost certainly played a role in the events leading up to the accident.METAR: 13:46 UTC / 06:46 local time: SPECI CYVR 131346Z 09008KT 15SM -RA FEW033 SCT056 OVC069 07/04 A2989 RMK SC2SC2AC4 SLP12314:00 UTC / 07:00 local time: CYVR 131400Z 15004KT 090V190 15SM -RA FEW033 SCT042 BKN054 OVC069 07/04 A2990 RMK SC2SC2SC3AC1 SLP124Wind 150 degrees at 4 knots, carying 90-190 degrees; visibility: 15 miles; rain; Few clouds at 3300 feet; Scattered clouds at 4200 feet; Broken clouds at 5400 feet; Overcast at 6900 feet; Temp. 7Â°C; Dew point 4Â°CAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A15P0081 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Flightaware History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  19 May 2000 N235BA Superior Aviation 0 Denver International Airport, CO (DEN) sub 20 February 2006 N235BA Superior Aviation 0 Casper, WY min Location  Images: photo (c) TSB; near Vancouver, BC; 14 April 2015 photo (c) TSB; near Vancouver, BC; 14 April 2015 photo (c) TSB; Vancouver, BC; 23 April 2015 photo (c) TSB; near Vancouver, BC; 13 April 2015 photo (c) TSB; near Vancouver, BC; 13 April 2015 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight was cleared for a runway 28 RNAV (GNSS) approach. During the approach a local transient fog layer moved over the airport. The Runway Visual Range in the touchdown zone decreased rapidly as low as 350 m. After that, the value recovered and returned to the value of more than 1,800 m. After the pilot in command and the first officer talked that the appearance of the runway was slightly odd, Hiroshima Tower reported a Touchdown RVR of 1,700 m. After that the captain disengaged the autopilot. At that time the aircraft was flying at 1000 feet above airfield elevation.  The aircraft then descended below the normal 3Â° glide path. At decision altitude, the captain called, ""Continue,"" and continued descending. Immediately after this, the first officer concernedly said, ""Runway was not in sight."" At this stage, the approach path was getting even lower but still remained uncorrected.  The captain said, ""Wait a second,"" as the aircraft descended to a position which indicated four red lights on the PAPI, if visible. The captain instructed the first officer to check radio altitude carefully. Afterward, an Auto Radio Altitude call of ""300 ft"" and ""200 ft"" were announced in a short interval, then, the captain called out for executing a go-around, and commenced raising the nose. Accordingly, the pitch angle of the aircraft was just about to increase; however, immediately after that, the aircraft collided with the Localizer antenna array, which is located 325 m before the runway 28 threshold.  The aircraft collided with the central parts of the LOC frame stand 6 m high with the both engines, both main landing gears, the flaps, the lower surface of fuselage and the horizontal stabilizers. Having collided with the LOC frame stand, the aircraft badly damaged lights of SALS and touched down on the grass area short of the runway 28 threshold with the fuselage tail, followed by the right and left main wheels followed. The aircraft smashed down ORL lights and proceeded on the runway. The left main gear folded due to severe damage, causing the left engine cowling to touch the runway surface. Subsequently, the airplane gradually veered off the runway to the left finally coming to a stop facing the southeast at the position in front of the airport boundary fence. When the purser came into the cockpit, she was told to wait and the captain gave priority to performing the Emergency Evacuation Checklist. Back in the cabin she heard flight attendants in the rear of the cabin calling and it seemed that smoke was coming up in the rear. She decided that an emergency evacuation was required, and proceeded to the forward left hand (L1) door. Having confirmed the inflation of the evacuation slide, she instructed the passengers to evacuate. The flight attendants then also began evacuating the passengers. All persons onboard were evacuated using the emergency slides and 27 persons suffered minor injuries. Probable Causes: It is certain that when landing on runway 28 at Hiroshima airport, the aircraft undershot and the PIC commenced executing a go-around; however, it collided with the Aeronautical Radio Navigation Aids located in front of runway 28 threshold, just before turning to climb.  Regarding the fact that the aircraft undershot, it is probable that there might be following aspects in causes: The PIC continued approaching without executing a goaround while the position of the aircraft could not be identified by visual references which should have been in view and identified continuously at or below the approach height threshold (Decision Altitude: DA); and as well, the first officer, as pilot-monitoring who should have monitored meteorological conditions and flight operations, did not make a call-out of go-around immediately when he could not see the runway at DA.  Regarding the fact that the PIC continued approaching without executing a goaround while the position of the aircraft could not be identified by visual references which should have been in view and identified continuously at or below DA, he did not comply with the regulations and Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), and it is probable that there was a background factor that the education and trainings for compliance of rules in the company was insufficient. In addition, regarding the fact that the first officer did not make an assertion of go-around, it is probable that the Crew Resource Management (CRM) did not function appropriatelyMETAR: 11:00 UTC / 20:00 local time: RJOA 141100Z VRB02KT 6000 -SHRA PRFG FEW000 SCT012 BKN020 09/08 Q100611:08 UTC / 20:08 local time: RJOA 141108Z VRB02KT 4000 R28/0300VP1800D -SHRA PRFG FEW000 SCT005 BKN012 09/08 Q1006 RMK 1ST000 4ST005 6CU012 A2973 1500E FG E-SWind, variable 2 knots: Visivility 4000 m: RVR, runway 28, variable between 300m and 1800m, downward: light shower of rain, partial fog: Cloud layers, 1 okta 0ft, 4 oktas 500ft, 6 oktas 1200ft: Temperature, 9 degree-Celsius: Dew-point, 8 degree-Celsius: QNH, 1006 hPa/2973 INS: Remark, Visibility 1500m for east quadrant, fog located from east to south.11:18 UTC / 20:18 local time: RJOA 141118Z 15003KT 5000 PRFG BR FEW000 SCT005 BKN012 09/09 Q1007 RMK 1ST000 4ST005 6CU012 A2974 FG BANK E-SAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: JTSB Report number: AA2016-9 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) K.Kouda; Hiroshima International Airport (HIJ); 09 June 2015 photo (c) JTSB; Hiroshima International Airport (HIJ); April 2015 photo (c) JTSB; Hiroshima International Airport (HIJ); April 2015 photo (c) JTSB; Hiroshima International Airport (HIJ); April 2015 photo (c) JTSB; Hiroshima International Airport (HIJ); 14 April 2015 photo (c) JTSB; Hiroshima International Airport (HIJ); 14 April 2015 photo (c) Felix Goetting; Beijing-Capital Airport (PEK/ZBAA); 17 October 2012 photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Seoul-Incheon International Airport (ICN/RKSI); 06 January 2009 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot was not injured. Dark night instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) prevailed at the time of the accident and an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan had been filed for the cargo flight. The airplane departed from Garfield County Regional Airport (RIL), Colorado, at 22:37 and was destined for Denver International Airport (DEN), Colorado The pilot reported that during climb, when still well below the tops of nearby mountains, he heard a ""bang"" followed by a complete loss of power and engine fire indications from the right engine. After completing appropriate checklist items the pilot declared an emergency and diverted to Grand Junction Regional Airport (GJT), Colorado, for an instrument approach and an otherwise uneventful landing at 23:11. A postaccident examination of the airplane revealed the second stage turbine rotor from the right engine had separated. One portion of the rotor exited through the left side of the engine and nacelle structure, penetrated the right side of the fuselage, and came to rest inside the fuselage wall.

There were no significant injuries to the crew. Post-flight engineering analysis revealed that the mishap aircraft exceeded the Design Limit Load (DLL), thus rendering it unsafe for further flight.  The mishap occurred on a medium risk flying qualities test sortie out to the edges of the flight envelope. The pilot was attempting to execute a Steady Heading Sideslip (SHSS) to the RUDDER Special Alert of the Advisory Caution and Warning System (ACAWS). This is normally a prohibited maneuver, but the Director of Operations at Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC/A3) signed a waiver approving the test team to fly to this limit. The MA exceeded 14.5Â° Angle of Sideslip (AoS), triggering the RUDDER Special Alert and continued increasing AoS until it departed controlled flight, eventually tumbling to an inverted position. Shortly thereafter, the aircraft recovered from the departure and the copilot took the controls to recover from the near vertical dive. In the process of the departure and recovery, the aircraft lost approximately 5,000 feet of altitude, experienced 3.19 times the normal force acceleration (Gs), and over sped the flaps by over 100 knots. The over G exceeded the aircraft's Design Limit Load. The Accident Investigation Board (AIB) President found, by a preponderance of the evidence, the cause of this mishap was the MP's [Mishap Pilot's] excessive rudder input during the test point followed by inadequate rudder input to initiate a timely recovery from high AoS due to Overcontrolled/Undercontrolled Aircraft and Wrong Choice of Action During an Operation. Additionally, the AIB President found, by a preponderance of the evidence, the following factors substantially contributed to the mishap: Instrumentation and Warning System Issues, Spatial Disorientation, Confusion, and the fact the test team was Provided Inadequate Procedural Guidance or Publications.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: USAF AIB Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

With the target approximately 40 m from the aircraft, the target winch accelerated rapidly and the target struck the leading edge of the wing before detaching and travelling over the wing. Although, the launcher and the droop leading edge on the wing were damaged, the aircraft landed safely. The target winch is powered by a turbine, and the speed of the turbine is controlled by vent doors. The target winch had oversped due to a fault with the closed limit switch on the vent doors which prevented the doors from closing. The target accelerated during the latter stages of its recovery, causing it to strike the aircraft. The acceleration was probably due to an overspeed of the target winch as a result of the failure of the vent door closed limit switch preventing the vent doors from closing when commanded. The turbine would then have spooled up, increasing the torque and resulting in the winch accelerating.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: EW/C2015/04/05 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  14 November 2023 G-FRAK Draken Europe 0 S of Exeter non Loss of control Images: photo (c) AAIB; 2015 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft and its crew were conducting a routine training mission in support of an Air Force Special Operations Command exercise. The crew consisted of cockpit crew, electronic warfare officers, intelligence operators and in-flight maintenance technicians. The pilot aborted the takeoff, and all crew members safely evacuated the aircraft. Four crewmembers received treatment for minor smoke inhalation. Fire crews arrived at approximately 18:29 and extinguished the flames. The fire burned a hole through the upper fuselage above the rear galley area of the aircraft, causing structural damage and damage to aircraft control and mission related systems. Repair cost to the aircraft is estimated at $62.4 million. The board president found by preponderance of the evidence that the cause of the mishap was a leak in the high-pressure oxygen system due to poor assembly of the system tubing at depot maintenance. Failure by L3 Communications depot maintenance personnel to tighten a retaining nut connecting a metal oxygen tube to a junction fitting above the galley properly caused an oxygen leak. This leak created a highly flammable oxygen-rich environment that ignited. The resulting fire melted the retaining nut causing the tubing to become detached from the junction fitting, feeding more oxygen to the fire, increasing its size, and causing severe damage to the airframe, galley, and mission equipment onboard the aircraft.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: USAF AIB Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) U.S. Air Force; Bellevue-Offutt AFB, NE (OFF); 2015; (publicdomain) photo (c) U.S. Air Force; Bellevue-Offutt AFB, NE (OFF); 2015; (publicdomain) photo (c) U.S. Air Force; Bellevue-Offutt AFB, NE (OFF); 2015; (publicdomain) photo (c) U.S. Air Force; Bellevue-Offutt AFB, NE (OFF); 2015; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

Flight 5612 was operating under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Par 121 as a regularly scheduled passenger flight from Albuquerque International Sunport (KABQ), Albuquerque, New Mexico, to KPHX.  After landing in KABQ, the crew were notified via ACARS that their arrival gate had changed from B7 to B21.Â  After arriving at the gate area, the crew inadvertently lined up with gate B23 and awaited marshallers.Â  As the marshallers arrived, the crew noticed that they were aligned with the wrong gate and that a left turn to enter gate B21 was not possible due to ground obstructions. As a result, the flight crew decided to perform a right turn to return to the ramp area and then enter gate B23.Â  The B757 was parked to the right of the CRJ900 at gate B25, and was aligned at about a 45 degree angle relative to the other parking configurations. As they reached approximately 90 degrees in the turn, the first officer (FO) advised the captain they were getting too close to the wing of the B757.Â  The captain proceeded to slowly complete the right turn to exit the gate but the flight crew then felt a shudder and the FO noted possible damage to the winglet of the B757.Â  The CRJ900 continued its taxi to the proper gate and all passengers deplaned normally.Â  After engine shutdown, the captain exited the airplane to assess any damage to the CRJ900 and noticed the horizontal stabilizer leading edge was substantially damaged.

Two of the six crew members survived the accident. The aircraft took off from runway 09 at 12:54 hours local time. The pilot, co-pilot, a mechanic and three engineers were conducting a test flight from Sevilla Airport (SVQ). The aircraft was built at the Airbus plant at Sevilla and was intended for the Turkish Air Force. It was the maiden flight after assembly. Shortly after takeoff three of the four engines became stuck at high power. Initially the three engines did not respond to the crewÂs attempts to control the power setting in the normal way. Pilots then succeeded in reducing power only after selecting the thrust levers to idle. Then the engines remained stuck at idle. In an attempt to return to the airport, the aircraft struck powerlines, impacted a field and burned. An Airbus official after the accident stated that engine control software was incorrectly installed during final assembly of the aircraft. This led to engine failure and the resulting crash.METAR: 10:30 UTC / 12:30 local time: LEZL 091030Z 07010KT 030V090 CAVOK 27/09 Q1022 NOSIG11:00 UTC / 13:00 local time: LEZL 091100Z 05009KT CAVOK 28/09 Q1022 NOSIG Sources: Flightradar24  El Pais  Airbus Defence and Space   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Before departure, the pilot and copilot completed a preflight inspection of the airplane and found everything to be normal. After taking off without incident, the flight crew started running the after takeoff checklist and the pilot moved the landing gear selector handle to the up position. The crew then felt and heard a loud ""clank"" in the nose of the airplane and observed that the red or unsafe nose gear light had illuminated; recycling the landing gear handle had the same result. As the flight crew returned to the departure airport, they selected the landing gear handle to the down position and received three green landing gear down indications and completed the before landing checklist; the air traffic controller advised that the nose landing gear appeared to be straight. During the landing, the airplane touched down on the main wheels first, but once the nosewheel touched down and weight was on the nose landing gear, the airplane suddenly turned sharply 30Â° to 40Â° to the left and application of right rudder did not counter the turn. The airplane then partially traveled off the left side of the runway pavement, its left main landing gear struck a concrete runway edge-light base, then the airplane turned about 180Â° from its original direction of travel and came to rest on the left side of the runway about 1,500 ft from the end of the runway. Probable Cause and Findings: The flight crewÂs inadequate preflight inspection of the nose landing gear strut, which resulted in the nosewheel not being aligned during retraction and the subsequent loss of directional control. Contributing to the accident was the failure of the nose landing gear strut due to inadequate pressure and excessive wear.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 years and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot was not injured. The cross-country personal flight departed Palm Springs, California, about 15:15 with a planned destination of Santa Ana, California. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed. The pilot reported that 10 minutes into the flight, he received an instrument flight rules flight plan from air traffic control (ATC). The cloud tops were at 8,500 feet and he was cleared to 6,000 ft, which put him in the clouds. Within minutes of entering the clouds, the airplane lost all electrical power, and the pilot lost contact with ATC. He climbed back out of the clouds and proceeded to the west; he found a hole in the clouds over the Pacific Ocean, descended, and turned southbound. He said partial electrical power was restored, and he tried to advise ATC of his problems. His transmissions were not understood, but he flew to Carlsbad, and received a green light from the tower personnel. He extended the landing gear and flaps but had no airspeed indicator. When the airplane touched down, the pilot realized that his landing gear had not extended. Witnesses reported that the airplane approached the runway and was faster than a normal landing, and the gear was still retracted. The pilot reported that after the loss of electrical power he did not perform any emergency procedures as the checklist was in a cabinet and not reachable; he was just trying to fly the airplane. The pilot stated that when he departed from Palm Springs, the generators were on. When asked if he attempted to reset the generators, he again stated that he did not do any emergency procedures except to fly the airplane. In a later interview, the pilot stated that he may have accidently turned on the starter switches, which would have turned off the generators and accounted for the loss of electrical power. A mechanic was dispatched to help defuel the airplane about 30 minutes after the accident. He reported that fuel was leaking from the right wing so he disconnected the battery. He opened an access panel but was unable to mechanically turn off the fuel selector valve (FSV). He reconnected the battery and went into the cockpit. He saw that the landing gear handle was in the down position, and the flap handle was in the full up position. The battery switch was in the OFF position with the battery gang bar down, which turned off the battery, generator 1, and generator 2. After lifting up the gang bar and turning on the battery switch, he saw nothing on the cockpit displays but heard the airplane power up. He located the FSV, turned it off, and confirmed with a firefighter that the solenoid in the wing audibly closed. The mechanic turned the electrical power off and disconnected the battery. The fuel leak from the right engine filter bowl stopped. It took the mechanic about 30 minutes to gather the equipment needed to defuel the airplane, and he decided to start with the right side by connecting to the engine supply line. He reconnected the battery and entered the cockpit to turn on the electrical power. With power on, the cockpit displays illuminated, and he heard the landing gear try to operate to the down position. After another mechanic pulled the circuit breaker for the avionics, he defueled the airplane. During recovery, the airplane was lifted off the ground, and the landing gear were successfully extended to the down and locked position. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The pilot's inadvertently turning on the starter switches, which turned off the generators and resulted in a loss of electrical power and gear-up landing. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's failure to follow the emergency procedures for a loss of electrical power or to manually extend the landing gear.

The aircraft was on a positioning flight from Kevsala (Ipatovo district of the Stavropol region) to Gribnoye, carrying four drums of oil. While flying at low altitude the engine failed. The pilot carried out a forced landing at Sanamer. The aircraft ran over a fence and came to rest against a church. The airplane did not have a valid Certificate of Airworthiness at the time of the accident. Conclusion (translated from Russian): The aircraft accident with the aircraft An-2s/x RA-56528 occurred due to the collision of the aircraft with an obstacle during the forced landing. The necessity of the forced landing was caused by the engine self-absorption during the flight, most probably due to the oil tank bloating and its wall pressing on the engine stop-crane lever on the carburetor. The increase in pressure in the oil tank and its bloating were the result of deposits of soot in the drainage pipe connecting the oil tank with the atmosphere.  Contributing factors: - Absence of the tank flushing, including the tank drainage pipeline with the atmosphere provided for by the periodic maintenance after 400Â±30 hours of flight or 12Â±1 month of operation; - Maintenance of aircraft by persons who do not have a certificate of a maintenance and repair specialist; - performance of the flight over the locality at an altitude that does not allow landing outside the locality in case of aircraft malfunction; - performance of the flight by an aircraft under the influence of alcoholic intoxication of the average degree.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: MAK  Southern Investigative Department of the Investigative Committee on Transport of the Russian Federation  Lifenews.ru   Location  Images: photo (c) Interstate Aviation Committee; Sanamer, Stavropol Territory; 18 May 2015 photo (c) Interstate Aviation Committee; Sanamer, Stavropol Territory; 18 May 2015 photo (c) Interstate Aviation Committee; Sanamer, Stavropol Territory; 18 May 2015 photo (c) Interstate Aviation Committee; Sanamer, Stavropol Territory; 18 May 2015 photo (c) Interstate Aviation Committee; Sanamer, Stavropol Territory; 18 May 2015 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

At 08:32 hrs G-LGNL was cleared to enter runway 18 at Stornoway Airport and take off, and the ATC controller transmitted that the surface wind was from 270Â° at 27 kt. The commander commented to the co-pilot that the wind was across the runway and that there was no tailwind. As the aircraft taxied onto the runway, the co-pilot applied almost full right aileron input consistent with a cross-wind from the right, and the commander said to the co-pilot ""charlie , one hundred, strong wind from the right"". The commander advanced the power levers, the co-pilot said ""autocoarsen high"" and the engine torques increased symmetrically. The commander instructed the co-pilot to ""set takeoff power"" to which the co-pilot replied ""apr armed"". Approximately one second after this call, the engine torques began to increase symmetrically, reaching 100% as the aircraft accelerated through 70 kt. During the early stages of the takeoff, left rudder was applied and the aircraft maintained an approximately constant heading. As the aircraft continued accelerating, the rudder was centralised, after which there was a small heading change to the left, then to the right, then a rapid heading change to the left causing the aircraft to deviate to the left of the runway centreline. The pilot applied right rudder but although the aircraft changed heading to the right in response, it did not alter the aircraftÂs track significantly and the aircraft skidded to the left, departing the runway surface onto the grass at an IAS of 80 kt. The power levers remained at full power as the aircraft crossed a disused runway and back onto grass. During this period the nose landing gear collapsed before the aircraft came to a halt approximately 38 m left of the edge of the runway and 250 m from where it first left the paved surface. After the aircraft came to a halt, the captain saw that the propellers were still turning and so called into the cabin for the passengers to remain seated. One of the passengers shouted for someone to open the emergency exit but the cabin crew member instructed the passengers not to do so because the propellers were still turning. The co-pilot observed that the right propeller was still turning so operated the engine fire extinguishers to shut down both engines. When the passenger seated in the emergency exit row on the right of the aircraft saw that the right propeller had stopped, he decided to open the exit. He climbed out onto the wing and helped the remaining passengers leave the aircraft through the same exit, instructing them to slide off the rear of the wing onto the ground. The left propeller was still turning at the time the right over-wing exit was opened and the passenger seated in the left-side emergency exit row decided not to open the left exit. The technique for controlling the direction of the aircraft on the runway is to use rudder assisted by nose wheel steering (NWS) at low speeds because the rudder has reduced effectiveness below 40 kt. When rudder is used, the requirement for NWS to assist directional control will reduce progressively as speed increases above 40 kt and rudder effectiveness increases. It is likely that no assistance will be required by 60 kt and, therefore, there will be no step-change in NWS directional effect when the pilot releases the steering control. During this attempted takeoff, rudder was approximately neutral from 40 kt, the point at which it would have become effective, and directional control was probably maintained through NWS alone (asymmetric thrust or differential braking having been discounted). If rudder had been applied, there would have been a reduced NWS requirement at any given speed and therefore there would have been a reduced likelihood of a change directional effect when the NWS control was released. The lack of data showing NWS commands meant that these considerations could not be verified. PROBABLE CAUSE: The investigation report did not contain a probable cause paragraph as recommended in ICAO Annex 13.METAR: 07:50 UTC / 07:50 local time: EGPO 020750Z 27019KT 9999 VCSH FEW015CB SCT042 05/02 Q100708:20 UTC / 08:20 local time: EGPO 020820Z 27022G33KT 9999 VCSH FEW015CB SCT040 05/01 Q1008Windes from 270 degrees at 22 knots, gusting to 33 knots; Visibility: 10+ km; showers in vicinity; few CB clouds at 1500 feet AGL; scattered clouds at 4000 feet AGL; Temperature: 5Â°C; Dewpoint: 1Â°C; Pressure: 1008 mb08:50 UTC / 08:50 local time: EGPO 020850Z 26018KT 9999 VCSH FEW015CB SCT018 05/01 Q1009Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: EW/C2015/01/01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: BBC  Loganair  SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) AAIB; Edinburgh-Turnhouse Airport (EDI/EGPH); 21 May 2009 photo (c) Rafboy15; Edinburgh-Turnhouse Airport (EDI/EGPH); 21 May 2009; (CC:by) photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Dublin Airport (DUB/EIDW); 28 July 2013 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight to Matthews Ridge was uneventful until the final approach to land. The aircraft approached the runway from the left and had to make a steep bank in an attempt to establish on the runway centerline. The aircraft was slow in the turn and was possibly further slowed by the steep bank causing the aircraft to exhibit the characteristics of an imminent accelerated stall. This forced the aircraft's rate of sink to increase and the pilot was unable to stabilize the aircraft's approach. The aircraft's port wing touched the ground first, followed by the port undercarriage. There were no injuries or fatalities. Cause: The probable cause of the accident was that the aircraft was slow and close to the threshold on left base of RWY29. The pilot executed and maintained a steep left turn which resulted in the aircraft experiencing an incipient accelerated stall. Contributory Causes: 1. The approach to landing was not properly configured, which resulted in an unsafe and unstable approach. 2. Although he felt the aircraft buffeting, the pilot did not recognize that there was an impending accelerated stall and did not react in a timely manner to correct it. 3. The weather was not conducive to VFR operations. 4. Given the prevailing weather conditions, the pilot should not have descended below the MSA of 3000ft. 5. It is believed that the pilot may have established a mindset to land because another pilot had landed four minutes earlier.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: GCAA-AIT Report number: GCAA: 2/5/1/78 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

On board were the flight crew of two and approximately 4,600 kg of freight.  The flight crew carried out the pre-start checklist and then started the right engine, after which the ground crew were given the signal to disconnect the ground power unit (GPU), positioned directly in front of the aircraft. The commander expected to see the GPU being moved clear of the aircraft, but when this did not happen he signaled the left engine start to the ground crew, which was approved. With the left engine started, the commander signaled for the nosewheel chocks to be removed, which was actioned by the ground crew. Immediately the chocks were removed, the aircraft began to move forward and the first officer saw the ground crew member run clear of the aircraft to the right. Both flight crew members immediately applied wheel brakes, but as they did so, the aircraft collided with the GPU. The flight crew shut down both engines and informed ATC. There were no injuries and damage was confined to forward parts of the aircraft and the top cover of the GPU. After the accident the flight crew realised that the parking brake was not set, resulting in the aircraftÂs movement when the chocks were removed. The commander noted that there had been an expectation that the parking brake would have been set to on when the crew first arrived at the aircraft. The parking brake was not an item on the turnaround checklist which the crew had carried out earlier, although it was an item on the pre-start checklist which had therefore not been carried out correctly. The commander also observed that the signal to remove the chocks was given before the GPU had been moved clear of the aircraft. Although the flight crew had not felt rushed, the commander believed that they had been under a time pressure due to the imminent airport closure, and that this had been a contributory factor.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: EW/G2015/01/05 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  11 March 2021 SE-MAI West Air Sweden 0 near East Midlands Airport, Castle Donington, Leicestershire non Fumes/smoke/odor event Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The sixteen occupants of the plane were not injured. Executive Secretary Paquito Ochoa and Communications Secretary Herminio Coloma Jr. were on board the private jet that departed following the visit of Pope Francis to Tacloban. Due to the approaching Tropical Storm Amang (Mekkhala) the Papal visit was cut short and all aircraft were prepared for departure. At 13:04 hours, the Global 5000 was given start up clearance by tower controller and subsequently a taxi clearance at 13:08 to exit via the south taxiway next to a departing Airbus A320 carrying the Papal entourage. Prevailing wind condition were 290Â° with a 18 knots crosswind and temperature of 24Â° . The airplane then had to wait for another A320 to depart at 13:22, which took-off with prevailing wind conditions of 290Â° with a 23 kts crosswind.  At 13:35 the Global 5000 was finally cleared for take-off from runway 36. The wind condition at that time was 300Â° at 18 kts with gustiness and a temperature of 24Â°. The aircrew performed a rolling take-off and the acceleration was normal, the pilot nonflying (NPF) called for air speed alive, 80 knots, V1 and Rotate. Before approaching the south taxiway abeam the terminal building, the aircraft started to veer to the left side of the runway centerline. The aircraft continued to roll veering to the left side of the runway and the left hand main landing gear was already out of the runway after the north taxiway. The aircraft suffered a runway excursion and sustained substantial damage after simultaneous collision with the concrete bases of runway edge lights and to the concrete culvert before it came to a complete stop at approximately 1500 meters from the take-off point. PROBABLE CAUSE: The Aircraft Accident Investigation and Inquiry Board determined that the probable cause of this accident was:  - Lack of recurrent training of the flight crew Routine flights do not prepare a pilot for unusual situations, whether they are unexpected crosswinds or systems/engine anomalies. Pilots should receive regular recurrent training to include abnormal and emergency procedures. - The existing runway edge light design The PIC tried to recover the aircraft back to the runway but apparently the aircraft left main landing gears already hit or bumped the concrete base of runway edge lights. The design of runway strips or shoulder must be free from fixed objects other than frangible visual aids provided for the guidance of aircraft and must notbe constructed with sharp edges; and where the lights will not normally come into contact with aircraft wheels, such as threshold lights, runway end lights and runway edge lights; - Human Factors Due to deteriorating adverse weather conditions and due to the delay of their initial request for take-off clearance plus the sudden change of flight plan affected the CaptainÂs ability to perform a take-off procedure as recommended in the aircraft flight manual and instead delegated flight control duties to the F/O resulting in the loss of coordination between the flight crew.Sources: GMA News   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Swiss International Air Lines flight LX1189 was preparing for departure to Zurich, Switzerland and the doors of the aircraft were closed. The aircraft was being de-iced when the de-icing employee heard the APU revving up. This was followed by a loud bang. After a second loud bang the APU stopped. Debris from the APU engine penetrated the pressure bulkhead and smoke appeared in the passenger cabin. The passengers were directed to the front of the cabin and all occupants left the plane through the forward exit. The APU air intake is located on the right of the fuselage, on the transition from the fin to the fuselage. De-icing fluid can easily enter through the open air intake when the APU is in operation. Furthermore, the de-icing agent causes a strong fog when applied, due to the difference in temperature. This restricts the visibility of the air intake. In addition, the area around the air inlet of the APU is not marked, making it harder to notice the location of the intake. The BFU notes that a safety recommendation of the NTSB following a similar accident, requested the APU to be switched off when the aircraft is de-iced. This measure had not been implemented in Europe. Conclusions: The failure of the APU and the resulting consequential damage was due to the intake and combustion of de-icing fluid. Visual restrictions and inadequate marking have contributed to the accident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BFU Report number: BFU AX001-15 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years Download report:  Final report Sources: BFU AX001-15 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  4 September 2003 N1450A American Airlines 0 New York-La Guardia Airport, NY (LGA/KLGA) sub Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Sky Express flight GQ100 was a domestic passenger flight from Heraklion on the Greek island of Crete to the island of Rhodes. The aircraft took off at 07:00 hours local time. Prior to departure the flight crew had been briefed that in the area of the Rhodes Airport the winds were S-SE at 17 kt with wind gust to 36 kt. For winds like these, the Rhodes (LGRP) AIP stated: ""Pilots landing or taking off at RODOS/ DIAGORAS Airport should exercise extreme caution when South or SouthEast (S-SE) winds of more than 15 Kts prevail, as moderate or severe turbulence and wind shear may be encountered on the final approach and/or initial climb out areas (mainly of RWY 07)."" At 07:23 hrs., approximately 12 min prior to landing, in the first contact of the flight crew with the Control Tower of Rhodes Airport, the flight crew was told winds were variable with a direction from 20Â° to 160Â°, average wind direction from 110Â°, wind velocity 20 kt gusting 38 kt. As laid down in the airport procedures, ATC, given the weather conditions, alerted the fire service vehicles to be stationed in readiness at their designated positions on the taxiways. Rhodes ATC then reminded the flight crew that as a result of the strong wind shear and turbulence, landing at the airport was not recommended under the circumstances. At 07:29 Rhodes ATC contacted the flight, informing that the wind was shifting from 40Â° to 260Â°, average wind direction from 120Â°, mean wind velocity 20 kt and wind gust 32 kt. Three minutes later, at about 8 nm from the airport, ATC contacted the flight crew again and informed that wind in the last ten minutes was shifting in all directions, with mean wind velocity 16 kt and wind gust 37 kt; ATC also repeated that under these conditions landing was not recommended. At 07:34, at about 4 nm to the airport, Rhodes ATC gave the crew a weather update: wind was shifting from 60Â° to 200Â°, mean wind velocity 15 kt, wind gust 32 kt and runway 07 was free for landing. One minute later ATC reported wind direction from 110Â°, 17kt. Given the prevailing winds, landing with 9Â° flaps and an airspeed of about 129 kt was selected by the crew. The flight continued to land and touched down at 07:36, with the right main landing gear touching down first. During deceleration immediately after touchdown, the aircraft veered to the left and came to rest at the left edge of the runway without exiting the runway. Probable Causes:  The decision to perform a landing following a non-stabilized approach. Landing with a strong and variable wind, the speed and the crosswind component of which were in excess of the values specified by the standard operating procedures, the aircraft manufacturer and the recommendations for the said aerodrome in AIP GREECE.

A TransAsia ATR-72-600 operating as flight GE235 from Taipei to Kinmen Island impacted a highway viaduct and the waters of the Keelung River near New Taipei City shortly after takeoff. Forty-three occupants on board the airplane suffered fatal injuries. Fifteen were injured. The airplane took off from Taipei-Sung Shan Airport's runway 10 at 10:51 hours local time and turned right, climbing to an altitude of 1350 feet. At 10:52 the master warning sounded in the cockpit associated with the right engine (no. 2) flame out procedure message. Some 26 seconds later the left hand (no. 1) power lever was retarded to flight idle. After twenty seconds the left engine condition lever was set to the fuel shutoff position resulting in left engine shutdown. Instead of continuing the climbing right hand turn, the airplane had turned left and began losing altitude and speed with several stall warnings sounding in the cockpit. At 10:53, the flight contacted the Sung Shan Tower controller declaring a Mayday and reporting an 'engine flameout'. The airplane then turned to the right while the crew attempted to restart the left hand engine. This succeeded at 10:54:20 hours. Fourteen seconds later the stall warning sounded in the cockpit. Video footage of the accident show that the airplane banked almost 90 degrees left as it hit a taxi on a viaduct. Parts of the left hand wing broke off upon hitting the barrier of the viaduct. The airplane broke up as it impacted the Keelung River and came to rest inverted. Findings Related to Probable Causes: Powerplant 1. An intermittent signal discontinuity between the auto feather unit (AFU) number 2 and the torque sensor may have caused the automatic take off power control system (ATPCS): - Not being armed steadily during takeoff roll; - Being activated during initial climb which resulted in a complete ATPCS sequence including the engine number 2 autofeathering.  2. The available evidence indicated the intermittent discontinuity between torque sensor and auto feather unit (AFU) number 2 was probably caused by the compromised soldering joints inside the AFU number 2.  Flight Operations 3. The flight crew did not reject the take off when the automatic take off power control system ARM pushbutton did not light during the initial stages of the take off roll. 4. TransAsia did not have a clear documented company policy with associated instructions, procedures, and notices to crew for ATR72-600 operations communicating the requirement to reject the take off if the automatic take off power control system did not arm.  5. Following the uncommanded autofeather of engine number 2, the flight crew failed to perform the documented failure identification procedure before executing any actions. That resulted in pilot flying's confusion regarding the identification and nature of the actual propulsion system malfunction and he reduced power on the operative engine number 1.  6. The flight crew's non-compliance with TransAsia Airways ATR72-600 standard operating procedures - Abnormal and Emergency Procedures for an engine flame out at take off resulted in the pilot flying reducing power on and then shutting down the wrong engine.  7. The loss of engine power during the initial climb and inappropriate flight control inputs by the pilot flying generated a series of stall warnings, including activation of the stick pusher. The crew did not respond to the stall warnings in a timely and effective manner. 8. The loss of power from both engines was not detected and corrected by the crew in time to restart an engine. The aircraft stalled during the attempted restart at an altitude from which the aircraft could not recover from loss of control.  9. Flight crew coordination, communication, and threat and error management (TEM) were less than effective, and compromised the safety of the flight. Both operating crew members failed to obtain relevant data from each other regarding the status of both engines at different points in the occurrence sequence. The pilot flying did not appropriately respond to or integrate input from the pilot monitoring.METAR: 02:00 UTC / 10:00 local time: RCSS 040200Z 11007KT 9999 -DZ FEW013 BKN028 BKN040 16/14 Q1024 NOSIG RMK A302602:25 UTC / 10:25 local time: RCSS 040225Z 10008KT 9999 FEW013 BKN028 BKN040 16/13 Q1024 NOSIG RMK A302603:00 UTC / 11:00 local time: RCSS 040300Z 10010KT 9999 FEW015 BKN028 BKN040 16/13 Q1024 NOSIG RMK A3025Winds: 100 degrees at 10 knots; few clouds at 1500 feet; broken clouds at 2800 feet; broken clouds at 4000 feet; Temperature: 16Â°C; Dewpoint: 13Â°C; Pressure: 1024 mbAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: ASC Report number: ASC-AOR-16-06-001 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: ASC Taiwan  Location  Images: photo (c) M940504; near Taipei-Sung Shan Airport (TSA); 04 February 2015; (publicdomain) photo (c) Aviation Safety Council; near Taipei-Sung Shan Airport (TSA); 04 February 2015 photo (c) Aviation Safety Council; near Taipei-Sung Shan Airport (TSA); 04 February 2015 photo (c) Hyun Fumio; Taipei-Sung Shan Airport (TSA); 17 July 2014; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) Yi-Fan Wu; Taipei-Sung Shan Airport (TSA); 24 January 2015 photo (c) Yi-Fan Wu; Taipei-Sung Shan Airport (TSA); 27 September 2014 photo (c) Yi-Fan Wu; Taipei-Sung Shan Airport (TSA); 21 September 2014 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates02-Jan-2025 10:56 ASN Updated [Source, Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All four occupants sustained fatal injuries. The airplane had undergone routine maintenance in Miami and was returning to Venezuela at the time of the accident. An NTSB review of maintenance records revealed that the left engine propeller had been due for overhaul. It was removed and replaced with an overhauled propeller prior to the accident flight and the accident flight was the first flight after the overhauled propeller was installed on the left engine.  The flight was cleared for takeoff at 14:36:45 hours local time. At 14:38:15, one of the pilots reported an ""engine failure"" to air traffic control. The controller asked the pilot if he would like to return to the airport and the pilot replied affirmative. The controller then offered a 180-degree turn to runway 9R and the pilot requested a left traffic pattern to runway 27L, which the controller approved; however, the airplane subsequently impacted a utility pole and terrain about 4,5 km west of the runway. The highest altitude recorded on radar was 300 feet. A postcrash fire consumed a majority of the cockpit and cabin.  It appeared that the no.1 engine prop feathered after takeoff and that the engine was shut down prior to the accident. PROBABLE CAUSE: "" The left engine propeller's uncommanded travel to the feathered position during takeoff for reasons that could not be determined due to impact damage.

Of the 250 passengers and crew onboard, one flight attendant was seriously injured, and three flight attendants and one passenger sustained minor injuries. The airplane was not damaged. The flight was operating under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 as a regularly scheduled passenger flight from Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), Newark, New Jersey, to HNL. The flight was uneventful from EWR across the continental United States. Once over the Pacific Ocean, the flight received an ACARS message from dispatch advising of an area of possible embedded thunderstorms. The flight experienced light to moderate turbulence for most of the remaining flight, which required the seat belt sign to remain on most of the time. About an hour from HNL, the captain returned early from his crew rest time because he noticed that the flight was encountering areas of moderate turbulence. Prior to entering the flight deck, the captain noticed that the flight attendants (FA) were seated in their jumpseats and advised the lead FA to not conduct the final service and remain seated.Â Â Shortly after retaking the left seat, and as the flight was passing immediately south of a line of embedded of the forecasted thunderstorms, the captain requested a descent from their cruising altitude of flight level (FL)360 to FL240. The flight crew reported they were in instrument meteorological conditions with precipitation during the descent. The weather radar was on and the seatbelt sign was illuminated. The flight encountered an area of severe turbulence for about 30 seconds as it was descending through FL254. The flight data recorder data indicate that the vertical acceleration fluctuated between about -0.17 g's and  1.62 g's, the lateral acceleration fluctuated between about -0.09 g's and  0.11 g's, and the roll fluctuated between about 5Â° left and 12Â° right. At the time of the turbulence, the FAs were securing the galleys, preparing the cabin for landing, and distributing agriculture documents.Â Â Four flight attendants (FA) in the aft galley were thrown against the ceiling and back to the floor, injuring all four. After being notified of the serious injuries, the flight crew declared an emergency with air traffic control and arranged for medical personnel to meet the aircraft at HNL. The four flight attendants were transported to the hospital where one flight attendant was diagnosed with a fractured arm and the other three were released with minor injuries. After landing the crew were notified by a passenger that their child had suffered a bloody nose, who was treated but not transported to the hospital. Probable Cause: an encounter with convective turbulence associated with a forecasted area of thunderstorms.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA15LA067 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA15LA067  https://flightaware.com/live/flight/UAL15/history/20150214/1410Z/KEWR/PHNL  http://www.khon2.com/news/local-news/nine-flights-to-and-from-the-islands-experience-weather-related-complications_20180309114038891/1025642249 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  17 December 2014 N59053 United Airlines 0 London Heathrow Airport (LHR/EGLL) non 6 March 2016 N59053 United Airlines 0 Houston-George Bush Intercontinental Airport, TX (IAH/KIAH) unk Bird strike Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates02-Jun-2023 13:19 ASN Update Bot Added 15-Jun-2023 20:52 Ron Averes Updated Corrections or additions? ...

The crew followed the emergency checklist and selected gear down and the indications changed to green, indicating that the landing gear was now down-and-locked. The crew elected to continue to Guernsey, Channel Islands with the undercarriage down. The aircraft performed an ILS approach and landed on runway 27. On touchdown, the aircraft pulled to the left and the co-pilot reported that there was no brake pressure. The commander suspected a tyre had burst and that hydraulic pressure had been lost. He therefore changed to the alternative braking system, slowed the aircraft and vacated the runway. The flight crew continued to taxi the aircraft and eight minutes passed before Guernsey ATC were informed that a tyre may have burst. Another aircraft landed on the runway during this period and before a runway inspection was initiated. Once G-RAJJ was parked, the crew discovered that the shock absorber on the left landing gear had separated and the tyre on the No 1 mainwheel had burst. Debris from the tyre and shock absorber was subsequently found on runway 27. The shock absorber separated either as a result of a hard landing, or incorrect gas pressures and oil level in the shock absorber. The physical damage to the shock absorber diaphragm threads and locking bolts started at least two flight cycles prior to the accident flight and may have occurred whilst it was fitted to another aircraft.

The flight crew elected to divert to St. Louis.  Although the activation of the fire suppression was a false alarm, the decision to divert was prudent and correct.  During the approach the crew made the decision to evacuate the airplane after landing, briefed the passengers in the courier area, and reviewed the evacuation checklist in the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH).  The diversion and subsequent landing were performed without issue.  After exiting the runway, and bringing the airplane to a stop in a safe area, the crew initiated an emergency evacuation using the left forward door (1L).  The door opened, however, the 1L escape slide/raft did not fully deploy, appearing to be hung up on a strap.  The first officer attempted to free it and the fire/rescue crew pulled on the slide and it appeared to inflate.  However, because the slide inflation sequence had been interrupted, it was significantly underinflated and unable to support the weight of the crewmember, resulting in a serious injury.  Post-incident examination of the 1L slide/raft was unable to determine the causes for the slide/raft to not inflate to full extension.

Marie Airport, ON (YAM) -   Canada","Landing","Passenger - Scheduled","Toronto-Pearson International Airport, ON (YYZ/CYYZ)","Sault Ste. Marie Airport, ON (YAM/CYAM)"," TSB","Accident investigation report completed and information captured","Air Canada Express flight 7795 was a scheduled domestic flight from Toronto/Lester B. Pearson International Airport, Canada, to Sault Ste. Marie Airport. On board the DHC-8-102 aircraft were 15 passengers, 2 flight crew members, and 1 cabin crew member. The captain performed the role of pilot flying (PF) and the first officer performed the role of pilot monitoring (PM). Just prior to descent from cruise altitude, the PF briefed the PM for the expected approach into Sault Ste. Marie. The PF was aware of the marginal weather conditions and included the possibility of a go-around and diversion in the briefing. As part of the briefing, the flight crew set the approach speed bugs to the appropriate speed for aircraft weight and flight conditions. The crew determined that the applicable landing reference speed (Vref) was 96 knots, which required an approach speed bug setting of 101 knots. When the aircraft was approximately 42 nautical miles (nm) from CYAM, the controller at the Toronto Area Control Centre cleared the flight to descend to 5000 feet above sea level (ASL) and, given the expected weather conditions, requested that the crew report when they had the airport in sight for the visual approach. As AC7795 reached 15 nm from Sault Ste. Marie in level flight at 5000 feet ASL, the crew reported that the in-flight visibility was reduced due to ice crystals. In consideration of this, they requested to be cleared for the VOR/DME approach to runway 30, rather than the visual approach, and were cleared as requested. While descending out of 3000 feet ASL, the flight crew passed through the area of ice crystals and acquired the airport visually. Although the flight was now in visual conditions, the crew noticed a significant snow shower approaching the arrival runway from the west. They reported these conditions to the controller, who cleared the flight for the visual approach, instructing them to deviate as necessary from the VOR approach. At 18:21:34 the aircraft passed over the final approach fix, 8.7 nm from the runway threshold, at a height of 2840 feet above ground level (AGL) and an indicated airspeed of 204 knots. The aircraft was descending on a 3Â° vertical path, although this was done visually, rather than with avionics-based vertical navigation guidance. The aircraft slowly decelerated from 204 to 181 knots while maintaining the 3Â° vertical path in descent from 2840 feet to 1500 feet. At 18:22:50, when AC7795 was 5 nm from Sault Ste. Marie, the flight crew contacted the Sault Ste. Marie control tower for landing clearance. The controller informed the crew that the wind was from 310Â° magnetic (M) at 22 knots with gusts to 29 knots, and mentioned the line of weather currently rolling across the runway. The controller further informed the crew that, due to this weather, the runway visual range (RVR) visibility had decreased to 1100 feet, with the runway lights set to level 4 intensity. The PM responded that they could see the approaching weather. At 18:23:05 and at 1500 feet, the power levers were moved toward flight idle and the engine torque reduced to between 3% and 4%. The aircraft began to decelerate more rapidly. The tower controller then informed AC7795 that the RVR had now reduced to 1000 feet, with the runway lights now at level 5 (full) intensity. Wind was reported as from 310Â°M at 25 knots, and JZA7795 was cleared to land. At 18:23:49, at 1000 feet and 2.8 nm from the runway threshold, the flaps were extended to 15Â° and the PF increased torque to 25%. The aircraft's airspeed was 148 knots. Between 1000 feet and 500 feet on approach, the aircraft generally maintained the 3Â° vertical path as the speed decreased from 148 to 122 knots. The engine torque varied during that time between 5% and 30% to account for configuration changes and wind gusts. At 500 feet, the airspeed was 122 knots, or 21 knots higher than the bugged approach speed of 101 knots. The aircraft was on the appropriate vertical path and torque was steady at 25%. The PF made the 8Â° left turn to align the aircraft with the runway heading. At 18:24:56, air traffic control (ATC) provided one last update to JZA7795, stating that the RVR was now 1200 feet. At 200 feet and at an airspeed of 124 knots, the PF began to reduce torque to idle and, as a result, the airspeed began to decrease rapidly. Although the aircraft's nose-up pitch was gradually increased and vertical speed was relatively stable, the vertical path steepened due to the decreasing airspeed and resultant ground speed reduction. The aircraft drifted below the 3Â° vertical path. This would normally be visually indicated by 4 red lights on the precision approach path indicator (PAPI), meaning the aircraft is too low. At some point below 200 feet, the flight crew lost visual reference to the ground due to the approaching weather system of blowing snow. The approach was continued. At 18:25:15, the terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS) issued a verbal alert to the pilots indicating that the aircraft's height was 50 feet. Then, at 20 feet, torque was increased toward 30%. At 18:25:19, the aircraft contacted the ground approximately 450 feet (137 meters) prior to the runway threshold at an airspeed of 94 knots. The ground preceding the runway was covered in approximately 8 to 12 inches of snow. The aircraft was in a level pitch attitude when it contacted the surface and touched down with a peak vertical acceleration of 2.32g. Following touchdown, the nose landing gear assembly and wheel struck and damaged an approach light located 300 feet prior to the runway threshold. The flight crew heard a thump, but had not seen the light and were unsure what had caused the noise. The aircraft came to a stop on the runway centreline, approximately 1500 feet past the threshold. The flight crew assessed the ground visibility as very poor, due to the blowing snow. Unsure of the aircraft's status, the flight crew informed the tower controller that the aircraft may have landed short of the runway and may have clipped the nosewheel. The crew asked the control tower to send a vehicle to their position to assess the situation, and requested that a bus be sent to move the passengers. When the emergency vehicles arrived and assessed the condition of the aircraft, no significant damage was noticed. Upon receiving this information, the flight crew elected to taxi the aircraft to the gate. The aircraft taxied to the gate without further incident, and the crew shut down the engines and deplaned the passengers. The crew did not believe there was damage to the aircraft and, therefore, did not pull the circuit breaker to prevent the cockpit voice recorder data from being overwritten. As a result, relevant data that would have been captured on the 30-minute cockpit voice recorder was overwritten while the aircraft remained electrically powered at the gate. After exiting the aircraft at the gate, the crew was notified of damage to an approach light and contacted maintenance to have the aircraft inspected. The aircraft sustained significant damage, mostly localized to the area near the nose landing gear, which had struck the approach light. The nose gear and nose gear doors were damaged and required replacement. Additionally, both main landing gear were determined to have exceeded load limits and required replacement. Findings as to causes and contributing factors: 1. The company standard operating procedures require an approach speed of Vref + 5 knots; however, this is being interpreted by flight crews as a target to which they should decelerate, from 120 knots, once the aircraft is below 500 feet. As a result, the majority of examined approaches, including the occurrence approach, were unstable, due to this deceleration. 2. Due to ambiguity in the guidance and uncertainty as to the required speeds during the approach, the crew did not recognize that the approach was unstable, and continued. 3. On the approach, the pilot flying reduced power to idle to reduce the approach speed from 122 knots toward 101 knots at 200 feet above ground level. This steepened the aircraft's vertical path. 4. The rapidly decreasing visibility resulted in the airport environment and the precision approach path indicator lights becoming obscured; as a result, the steepened vertical profile went unnoticed and uncorrected. 5. Although the loss of visual reference required a go-around, the crew continued the approach to land as a result of plan continuation bias. 6. The terrain awareness and warning system did not alert the crew to the aircraft's proximity to the ground once the aircraft was below 50 feet, possibly due to the rapid rate of closure. This lack of warning contributed to the crew not being aware of the aircraft's height above ground. 7. Due to the uncorrected steepened vertical profile, loss of visual reference, and lack of normal terrain warning, the aircraft contacted the surface approximately 450 feet prior to the runway threshold. Findings as to risk: 1. If guidance provided to flight crews allows for large tolerance windows, and crews are not trained to recognize an unstable condition, then there is a continued risk that flights that are unstable will be continued to a landing. 2. If approaches that require excessive deceleration below established stabilization heights are routinely flown, then there is a continued risk of an approach or landing accident. 3. If crews do not report unstable approaches and operators do not conduct flight data monitoring but rely only on safety management system reports to determine the frequency of unstable approaches, there is a risk that these issues will persist and contribute to an accident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A15O0015 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources: Flightaware  Sault Star 28-2-2015   Location  Images: photo (c) Google Earth; Sault Ste.

Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and an IFR flight plan was filed for the flight from Marathon-Florida Keys Airport (MTH), Florida. The airplane sustained substantial damage. The airline transport pilot and co-pilot, 1 flight attendant, and 4 passengers were not injured, 1 passenger sustained serious injuries, and 1 passenger sustained minor injuries. The flight originated from MTH about 15:54. The pilot-in-command (PIC) stated that the landing dry and wet distances were calculated to be 3,166 and 4,166 feet, respectively. The flight departed MTH and while en route they obtained the MKY automated weather observing station (AWOS) which indicated the wind was from 250 degrees at 5 knots, and the visibility was 10 miles. The PIC further stated they reviewed the speeds (Vref of 133 knots), and planned a visual approach to runway 17. Air traffic control approved their request for a visual approach, and they changed to the common traffic advisory frequency, entering left downwind for runway 17. They slowed, lowered the flaps to 20 degrees, and noted rain 2 to 3 miles east of MKY, though the airport appeared to be dry. When the flight was abeam runway 17, the landing gear was lowered and the flaps were extended to 30 degrees. The landing checklist was performed, and the anti-skid test was normal. The thrust reversers were armed, and he performed a ""teardrop turn"" to final. With flaps at 45 degrees, gear down, and flying Vref plus 10 knots, a couple of gusts were encountered during the approach. The co-pilot checked the AWOS again; the wind was still 250 degrees at 5 knots. He maintained a normal glide path at Vref plus 4 or 5 knots at the runway threshold, where he positioned both thrust levers to idle. The airplane was landed firm about 300 to 500 feet beyond the aiming point marking, and after touchdown he was unable to extend the ground spoilers. When the nose landing gear contacted the runway, he applied ""moderate"" brakes and held the control yoke forward, but felt no deceleration. He also attempted to deploy the thrust reversers but was unable. The PIC informed the co-pilot there was no braking energy and released the brakes; the anti-skid was turned off and the brakes were re-applied pressing hard. He did not feel any deceleration, and again tried to deploy the thrust reversers, but was unable. He kept the airplane on the runway centerline, and began modulating the brakes. Unable to stop the airplane he added right rudder input causing the airplane to veer to the right. The airplane went off the end of the runway into sand causing the nose landing gear to collapse. After coming to rest he ordered an emergency evacuation, and secured the engines. PROBABLE CAUSE: The failure of a spring inside the No. 2 brakeÂs upper brake control valve and the fracture of the coupling subassembly of the No. 1 wheel speed sensor during landing, which resulted in the loss of braking action, and the pilot-in-commandÂs (PIC) deactivation of the antiskid system even though there were no antiskid failure annunciations, which resulted in the rupture of the Nos. 1, 3, and 4 tires, further loss of braking action, and subsequent landing overrun. Contributing to accident were the PICÂs improper landing flare, which resulted in landing several hundred feet beyond the aiming point marking, and his unsuccessful attempts to deploy the thrust reversers for reasons that could not be determined because postaccident operational testing did not reveal any anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. Contributing to the passengerÂs injury was his leaving his seat intentionally while the airplane was in motion.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA15LA140 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Marco Island Airport, FL (MRK); March 2015; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Marco Island Airport, FL (MRK); March 2015; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Marco Island Airport, FL (MRK); March 2015; (publicdomain) photo (c) Mike Demulling; Marco Island Airport, FL (MRK); 08 December 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) Mike Demulling; Marco Island Airport, FL (MRK); 08 December 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; March 2015; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Flight TK726 was a regular passenger service from Istanbul-AtatÃ¼rk International Airport (IST) to Kathmandu, Nepal. The flight was the first international flight to scheduled to arrive that morning. After descending from cruising altitude, it entered a holding pattern at FL210 at 06:12 hours local time (00:27 UTC) until about 07:00 (01:15 UTC) when it was cleared for a VOR/DME approach to runway 02. This approach was abandoned at about the Missed Approach Point at 1DME and the aircraft performed a go around. The aircraft circled and positioned for a second approach to runway 02. The aircraft touched down to the left of the runway centerline with the left hand main gear off the paved runway surface. It ran onto soft soil and the nose landing gear collapsed. The aircraft touched down at to the left of the centerline because the FMGS NAV database contained threshold coordinates for a proposed displacement of the runway 02 threshold. This was later withdrawn through a NOTAM, but had not been updated by the airline in the FMGS. Additionally, the coordinates that were initially published were inaccurate, causing the threshold coordinates to be offset to the left of the actual threshold. This had been noticed and reported by a previous Turkish Airlines flight on March 2. The changes to the FMGS had not been performed by the time TC-JOC landed at Kathmandu. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The decision of the flight crew to continue approach and landing below the minima with inadequate visual reference and not to perform a missed approach in accordance to the published approach procedure.

The 2 pilots, 3 flight attendants, and 98 of the 127 passengers were not injured; the other 29 passengers received minor injuries. The airplane was substantially damaged.  Flight 1086 was a regularly scheduled passenger flight from Atlanta-Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Georgia, where it departed at 09:23 hours local time.  Given the winter weather conditions at LaGuardia, the flight crew was concerned about the available landing distance on runway 13 (7003 ft / 2135 m). While en route to LGA they spent considerable time analyzing the airplaneÂs stopping performance. The flight crew also requested braking action reports about 45 and 35 minutes before landing, but none were available at those times because of runway snow clearing operations. The unavailability of braking actions reports and the uncertainty about the runwayÂs condition created some situational stress for the captain, who was the pilot flying. After runway 13 became available for arriving airplanes, the flight crews of two preceding airplanes (which landed on the runway about 16 and 8 minutes before the accident landing) reported good braking action on the runway, so the flight crew expected to see at least some of the runwayÂs surface after the airplane broke out of the clouds. However, the flight crew saw that the runway was covered with snow, which was inconsistent with their expectations based on the braking action reports and the snow clearing operations that had concluded less than 30 minutes before the airplane landed. The snowier-than-expected runway, along with the relatively short runway length and the presence of Flushing Bay directly off the departure end of the runway, most likely increased the captainÂs concerns about his ability to stop the airplane within the available runway distance, which exacerbated his situational stress.  The captain made a relatively aggressive reverse thrust input almost immediately after touchdown. Both pilots were aware that 1.3 EPR was the target setting for contaminated runways. As reverse thrust EPR was rapidly increasing, the captainÂs attention was focused on other aspects of the landing, which included steering the airplane to counteract a slide to the left and ensuring that the spoilers had deployed, which was a necessary action for the autobrakes to engage. The maximum EPR values reached during the landing were 2.07 on the left engine and 1.91 on the right engine, which were much higher than the target setting of 1.3 EPR. These high EPR values likely resulted from a combination of the captainÂs stress; his relatively aggressive reverse thrust input; and operational distractions, including the airplaneÂs continued slide to the left despite the captainÂs efforts to steer it away from the snowbanks alongside the runway. All of these factors reduced the captainÂs monitoring of EPR indications. The high EPR values caused rudder blanking, which occurs on MD-80 series airplanes when smooth airflow over the rudder is disrupted by high reverse thrust, and a subsequent loss of aerodynamic directional control. Although the captain stowed the thrust reversers and applied substantial right rudder, right nosewheel steering, and right manual braking, the airplaneÂs departure from the left side of the runway could not be avoided because directional control was regained too late to be effective. The airplane departed the left side of runway 13 about 3,000 feet from the approach end of the runway. The tracks were on a heading of about 10 degrees from the runway heading. About 4,100 feet from the approach end of the runway, the airplanes left wing initially struck the airportÂs perimeter fence, which is located on top of the berm, and the airplane tracks turn back parallel with runway 13. About 5,000 feet from the approach end of the runway, the airplane came to rest with its nose over the berm. The left wing of the airplane destroyed about 940 feet of the perimeter fence. PROBABLE CAUSE: The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the captainÂs inability to maintain directional control of the airplane due to his application of excessive reverse thrust, which degraded the effectiveness of the rudder in controlling the airplaneÂs heading. Contributing to the accident were the captainÂs (1) situational stress resulting from his concern about stopping performance and (2) attentional limitations due to the high workload during the landing, which prevented him from immediately recognizing the use of excessive reverse thrust.METAR: 15:24 UTC / 10:24 local time: KLGA 051524Z 04007KT 1/4SM R04/2600V2800FT SN FZFG VV009 M03/M04 A3013 RMK AO2 P000415:51 UTC / 10:51 local time: KLGA 051551Z 01008KT 1/4SM R04/2800V3500FT SN FZFG VV009 M03/M05 A3012 RMK AO2 SLP199 P0006 T1033105016:22 UTC / 11:22 local time: KLGA 051622Z 01008KT 1/4SM R04/3000VP6000FT SN FZFG VV011 M03/M05 A3012 RMK AO2 SFC VIS 1/2 P0003Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NTSB/AAR-16/02 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  Flightradar24  Liveatc.net   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; New York-La Guardia Airport, NY (LGA); 05 March 2015; (publicdomain) photo (c) Sergio Cardona; New York-La Guardia Airport, NY (LGA); 05 March 2015 photo (c) NTSB; New York-La Guardia Airport, NY (LGA); March 2015; (publicdomain) photo (c) Leonard J.

The aircraft operated flight SG1085 from Bangalore to Hubli and departed at around 13:00 UTC. At the time the visibility reported for Hubli was 10 km.  When the aircraft came in contact with Mangalore ATC, the controller cleared the aircraft direct to Hubli and informed heavy rains and thunder showers over Hubli with visibility 3000 m. At around 60 nm from Hubli, the weather reported was heavy rain and visibility 4000 meters. ATC cleared aircraft for the NDB approach runway 26, however the captain preferred to carry out a VOR/DME trial procedure for runway 26. The descent was commenced and about 25 nm short of Hubli, ATC again advised visibility has reduced to 3000 m due heavy rain and thunderstorm. Thereafter the crew decided to hold over Hubli until the weather improves. Twenty minutes into holding, ATC again informed that visibility has improved to 4000 m in moderate rain. Subsequently descent was requested by the pilot for runway 26. The captain stated that he had established visual reference with runway at about 6 nm on the final approach course. The crew also selected wipers on short final to have a better visibility. The aircraft landed normally.  The captain stated that after touch down and reducing power, he was concentrating on the far end of the runway. As the runway was wet, he did not realize that the aircraft was drifting to the left of the center line. He further mentioned that he selected full reverse on both the engines to maintain the aircraft on the center line however the aircraft veered toward the left side of the runway and in the process overran the runway edge light, after which the left main landing gear collapsed. The propeller blades hit the runway surface and sheared off from the root attachment. The captain maneuvered the aircraft however the nose wheel tyre failed under over load conditions and the nose landing gear collapsed as well.  Subsequently, the aircraft exited the runway on the left side on kutcha (dried mud) and came to a final stop at round 52 meters away from the runway center line. The cockpit crew shut down the engines and the electrical power supply and cockpit door and announced evacuation. The cabin crew opened and the cabin doors on the right for evacuation.  There was no injury to any of the occupants on board the aircraft. There was no postaccident fire. Probable cause of the accident: Loss of visual cues after touch down in inclemental weather conditions resulted in veering of the aircraft towards left of the centerline leading to runway excursion and accident. Following are the contributory factors. 1. Inappropriate handling technique of the aircraft controls by the PIC to maintain the directional control of the aircraft after landing. 2. Non-standards callouts by the first officer to correct situation after landing. 3. Impact of the landing gear with the non-frangible erected runway edge light resulted in retraction of the same. 4. At the time of the accident DGCA O.M. No. AV.15026/006/92- AS dated 3rd February 1992 was in force, which dictated examiners and instructors of the operators only to carry out trial procedures in VMC and during Daytime only.

The pilot, the sole occupant on board, was not injured, and the airplane sustained substantial damage.  Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident, and an instrument flight rules flight plan had been filed. The flight originated from Lansing-Capital City Airport (LAN), Michigan and was destined for Muskegon County Airport. According to the pilot he flew the approach to minimums, saw the approach lights and saw he was right of the runway. As he maneuvered to realign the airplane with the runway, he struck the approach lights. After landing, he examined the airplane and found the left horizontal stabilizer hanging down. There were numerous dents on the leading edge of the left wing strut, and the left landing gear was bent. Effective at the time of this accident was a permanent Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) associated with the ILS runway 24 approach prohibiting a coupled autopilot approach from 1150 feet mean seal level to the surface. During a post-accident interview the pilot stated he was unaware of this NOTAM. The NOTAM had been in effect since February 21st, 2014 and the approach chart used did not note this approach restriction.

The co-pilot performed the external checks; this included checking the fluid level in the hydraulic reservoir. The aircraft was refuelled to 3,000 lb and, after the passengers boarded, it departed for Blackpool. The commander was the pilot flying (PF). The takeoff and cruise to Blackpool were uneventful.  The commander planned and briefed for the NDB approach to runway 10, which was to be flown with the autopilot engaged. Whilst descending through FL120, the left, followed by the right, hydraulic low pressure cautions illuminated. Upon checking the hydraulic pressure gauge, the pressure was noted to be Âcycling up and downÂ, but for the majority of the time it indicated about 2,800 psi (in the green arc). During this time the hydraulic low pressure cautions went on and off irregularly, with the left caution being on more often than the right. The co-pilot then actioned the ÂHYDRAULIC SYSTEM - HYDRAULIC PUMP FAILUREÂ checklist. It stated that if the hydraulic pressure was a minimum of 2,800 psi, the flight could be continued. Just before the aircraft reached the Blackpool NDB, the commander commented ""itÂs dropping"", but he could not recall what he was referring to. This was followed by the roll fail and speed brk [brake] fail caution messages illuminating. The co-pilot then actioned the applicable checklists. These stated that the Landing Distances Required (LDR) would increase by approximately 65% and 21%, respectively. As the roll fail LDR increase was greater than that of the speed brk fail, the crew used an LDR increase of 65% which the co-pilot equated to 5,950 ft. Runway 10 at Blackpool has an LDA of 6,131 ft, therefore they elected to continue to Blackpool. The roll fail checklist stated that a ÂFLAPS UPÂ landing was required. The co-pilot then calculated the VREF of 132 kt, including a 20 kt increment, as stipulated by the ÂFLAPS UP, 10, OR 20 APPROACH AND LANDINGÂ checklist. The commander then continued with the approach. At about 4 nm on final approach the co-pilot lowered the landing gear, in response to the commanderÂs request. About 8 seconds later the commander said ""just lost it all""; referring to the general state of the aircraft. This was followed almost immediately by the landing gear unsafe aural warning, as the main landing gear was not indicating down and locked. Whilst descending through 1,000 ft, at just over 3 nm from the threshold, the commander asked the co-pilot to action the ÂALTERNATE GEAR EXTENSIONÂ checklist. The commander then discontinued the approach by selecting ALT HOLD, increased engine thrust and selected a 500 ft/min rate of climb on the autopilot. However, a few seconds later, before the co-pilot could action the checklist, the main gear indicated down and locked. The commander disconnected the autopilot and continued the approach. The crew did not consider reviewing the ÂHYDRAULIC SYSTEM - HYDRAULIC PUMP FAILUREÂ checklist as they had not recognised the symptoms of loss of hydraulic pressure. When ATC issued the aircraft its landing clearance the wind was from 140Â° at 17 kt. This equated to a headwind component of about 10 kt and a crosswind of about 12 kt. As the aircraft descended through 500 ft (the Minimum Descent Altitude (MDA) for the approach) at 1.5 nm from the threshold, the commander instructed the co-pilot to advise ATC that they had a hydraulic problem and to request the RFFS to be put on standby. There was a slight delay in transmitting this request, due to another aircraft on frequency, but the request was acknowledged by ATC. The aircraft touched down about 1,500 ft from the start of the paved surface at an airspeed of 132 kt and a groundspeed of 124 kt. When the commander applied the toe (power) brakes he felt no significant retardation. During the landing roll no attempt was made to apply the emergency brakes, as required in the event of a power brake failure. The co-pilot asked if he should try to operate the lift dump, but it failed to function, due to the lack of hydraulic pressure. At some point, while the aircraft was on the runway, the co-pilot transmitted a MAYDAY call to ATC. When an overrun appeared likely, the commander shut down the engines. The aircraft subsequently overran the end of the runway at a groundspeed of about 80 kt. The commander later commented that he was in a ""state of panic"" during the landing roll and was unsure whether or not he had applied the emergency brake. As the aircraft left the paved surface the commander steered the aircraft slightly right to avoid a shallow downslope to the left of runwayÂs extended centreline. The aircraft continued across the rough, uneven ground, during which the nose gear collapsed and the wing to fuselage attachments were severely damaged. Once it had come to a stop, he shut down the remaining aircraft systems. The passengers and crew, who were uninjured, vacated the aircraft via the entry/exit door and moved upwind to a safe distance. The investigation determined that, irrespective of the omission to apply the emergency brakes, the Landing Distance Available (LDA) at Blackpool was insufficient for the aircraft to land with a hydraulic failure.  A fatigue crack in the port cap1 of the left hydraulic pump had caused a hydraulic leak which eventually resulted in the total loss of the hydraulic system.METAR: 11:50 UTC / 11:50 local time: EGNH 121150Z 15021KT 9000 FEW024 11/08 Q102012:20 UTC / 12:20 local time: EGNH 121220Z 14018KT 9000 FEW024 12/08 Q1020Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: EW/C2015/03/01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) Steve; Blackpool Airport (BLK); 13 March 2015 photo (c) AAIB; Blackpool Airport (BLK); March 2015 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Purpose of the flight was to carry out flight inspections to confirm the required performance of aeronautical navigation facilities. The captain was Pilot Flying. While the aircraft was flying south-southwest on Airway V31 toward the Niigata VORTAC at an altitude 9,000 ft, the captain and the first officer sighted a lower layer of clouds but had visually confirmed that there was no cloud on the flight route in the vicinity of Niigata Airport. At about 14:32, the aircraft commenced a descending turn from right above Niigata Airport in order to inspect on the next airway. At this time, the captain and the first officer had checked on an indication on the weather radar display of the aircraft showing a precipitation area, albeit not on their route, and were therefore focusing attention in that direction. They then encountered scattered thin clouds, but this was judged not to be thick clouds which might lead to turbulence or thunder. At about 14:35, as the aircraft entered the thin cloud at an altitude about 6,500 ft, a very loud noise was heard on the radio equipment while the captain, the first officer and the onboard maintenance engineer were listening to it. After three to four seconds, the captain and the first officer received an impact accompanied by a loud popping noise, together with a strong flash from the front of the aircraft. While continuing the flight, the captain and the first officer checked the instruments to check whether abnormality had occurred to the aircraft; consequently, they confirmed that discoloration was found on some of the cockpit instrument displays, and that the airborne DME (Distance Measuring Equipment) display on the captain's side had disappeared. However, there was no abnormality in the DME display on the first officer's side and there was no problem with the visibility of the discolored instrument displays; accordingly, they judged there to be no serious abnormality which would affect the flight. The captain, the first officer and the onboard maintenance engineer discussed whether they should continue the flight inspection, and although there was thought to be no hindrance to the flight, they decided to suspend the flight and return to the base of the aircraft at Tokyo International Airport, because they could not confirm damage to the airframe while on board. Thereafter the aircraft landed at Tokyo International Airport at 15:26. On the post-flight inspection, damage was confirmed to the left front fuselage outer skins, the front lower fuselage and the left horizontal stabilizer. PROBABLE CAUSES: ""It is probable that this accident occurred because the aircraft sustained damage to the outer skins of its left front lower fuselage as a result of being struck by lightning to the airframe in flight. It is probable that the lightning strike was occurred because the aircraft came close to the electrically charged cumulus clouds in the scattered thin cloud where it was difficult to predict lightning.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JTSB Report number: AA2016-9 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) JTSB; Tokyo-Haneda Airport (HND/RJTT); March 2015 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight was a regular passenger service from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to Melbourne. The flight crew consisted of a captain, who was the pilot flying (PF) and a first officer, who was pilot monitoring (PM). The approach to runway 34 at Melbourne airport was not equipped with an Instrument Landing System (ILS), so a non-precision approach was performed, aided by PAPI lights.  Flight data showed that the PF disengaged the autopilot at approximately 700 feet above ground level (AGL) and from that point until touchdown there was an increase in the frequency and magnitude of sidestick pitch control inputs by the PF. In response to these inputs the aircraftÂs autothrottle system varied the engine thrust to maintain a target speed, as per system design, and the aircraft pitch angles fluctuated between approximately -0.5Â° nose down and +5.0Â° nose up. The net result of the varying thrust settings and pitch angles was a fluctuating rate of descent between approximately 380 and 960 feet per minute. Large sidestick inputs, specifically nose-down, also have the potential to inhibit the vertical speed reduction function, which is an automated function that provides some protection against touchdown at very high vertical speeds. As the aircraft passed 300 feet a rate of descent of 960 feet per minute was recorded. This neared the operatorÂs maximum stabilised approach limit of 1000 feet per minute when below 500 feet AGL. As well as a high rate of descent, actual exceedances of the operatorÂs stabilisation criteria included: large changes to pitch inputted by the pilot flying, including negative pitch values, fluctuations in the rate of descent over a large range that were abnormal for the phase of flight, incorrect glide path.  From approximately 250 feet AGL, the aircraft was trending low and continuing below the glide path. At this point the pilots would have been able to observe 3 red lights and one white light on the PAPI. This trend was allowed to continue until the aircraft was well below the desired glide path to the extent that the PAPI would have indicated 4 red lights from approximately 125 feet AGL. From this point the PF made numerous pitch commands which were mostly nose down. These included a full range nose down deflection at 24 feet AGL. The company procedures and manufacturerÂs recommendations dictated that if an approach becomes unstable below 500 feet AGL, a go-around must be initiated by the pilot flying (PF) and/or the pilot monitoring (PM) must alert the PF of the unstable approach and encourage a go-around. At 60 feet AGL the captain moved the thrust levers forward momentarily into the TOGA (Take-off/Go Around) detent. The captain stated that this was done in response to a feeling that the aircraft was sinking below the path, and the intention was to reduce this sink by applying more thrust to the engines. The placement of the thrust lever into TOGA placed the aircraft automation into the go-around autopilot modes and changed the display on the primary flight display flight mode annunciator (FMA). The captain subsequently reduced the thrust levers. The PM, on seeing the modes on the FMA change assumed that a go-around was being conducted and awaited further announcement from the captain. The PM reported noticing the thrust levers reducing and that the aircraft was not flaring and applied nose up input to the sidestick at the same time as the PF. At the time of the occurrence there was no procedure on the A330 for the use of manual thrust for this purpose. Prior to 2009, a procedure existed in the Airbus A330 documentation that allowed a specific use of manual thrust in difficult environmental conditions. Airbus advised that after an analysis of in-service events the procedure was removed from all operational documents.  Manipulation of the thrust levers in this manner had the effect of disengaging the autothrottle thereby inhibiting some of the available auto flight system protections including the target speed function (which automatically maintained the desired speed and adjusted for fluctuation in the wind), and the vertical speed reduction function. It also caused a pitch up tendency which usually requires a large nose down input by the pilot flying to prevent the aircraft from pitching up. At this stage in the approach applying large nose down inputs differed from the gradual nose up input normally required to complete the flare. Furthermore, it resulted in breaking down of the shared mental model between the pilot flying and pilot monitoring in that the pilot monitoring believed the advancement of the thrust levers was the initiation of a go-around. Shortly after this action, the aircraft touched down at a vertical speed of approximately 700 feet per minute and a vertical acceleration of 2.61 G was recorded. The aircraft also touched down at approximately 170m (560 feet) from the landing threshold, short of the normal touchdown zone of between 304m (1000 feet) and 609m (2000 feet). The manufacturer of the aircraft produced a complete load analysis of the event based on recorded flight data provided by the operator. The conclusion of this analysis was that several components in the left and right gear had ""exceeded their design load limits and may have been detrimentally overloaded"". There were no injuries reported as a result of the hard landing. The airplane remained at Melbourne until March 26, when it was ferried at low altitude to Darwin, Australia, and continuing to Kuala Lumpur the next day for further repairs. Contributing factors: - The final approach became unstable at around 300 feet above the ground due to the control inputs from the captain. - Inadequate monitoring and communication by the crew led to a lack of recognition of the undesirable flight state and the continuation of an unstable approach. - Continuation of the unstable approach led to a high rate of descent at touchdown and resulted in a hard landing in excess of the aircraft design loads and short of the normal touchdown area. Other safety factors: The captain used an unapproved manual thrust procedure in an attempt to recover the approachMETAR: 20:30 UTC / 07:30 local time: YMML 132030Z 36012KT CAVOK 11/07 Q1016 NOSIG21:00 UTC / 08:00 local time: YMML 132100Z 36015KT CAVOK 12/07 Q1016 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: ATSB Report number: AO-2015-032 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources: ATSB   Location  Images: photo (c) Flightaware.com; Melbourne-Tullamarine Airport, VIC (MEL); 14 March 2015 photo (c) ATSB; Melbourne-Tullamarine Airport, VIC (MEL); 14 March 2015; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The force landing was a result of a loss of engine power during an en route climb. The pilot received minor injuries and the passenger was not injured. The airplane was substantially damaged. The aircraft was owned and operated by the pilot as post maintenance test flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight. The flight originated from the Tulsa International Airport, Oklahoma, at 15:00. The airplane was equipped with a Honeywell TPE331 engine which had been installed about 9 flight hours prior to the accident. The pilot stated they were climbing to 11,000 feet when he noticed a decrease in engine torque with a steady exhaust gas temperature (EGT). As the torque started to drop even more, the EGT also began to decrease. The pilot attempted to fly to a nearby airstrip, but was unable to maintain sufficient altitude. He then chose a field in which to land. Shortly after touching down, the airplane contacted trees, completely severing the left wing from the fuselage and partially severing the right wing from the fuselage. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The fuel pump gear manufacturerÂs allowance of set-up gears made from a nonconforming material to be put in the production inventory system, the installation of a nonconforming gear in the accident airplaneÂs production fuel pump, and the gearÂs failure, which resulted in a loss of fuel flow to the engine and the subsequent loss of engine power.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN15LA180 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NewsOn6  NTSB   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All 144 passengers and six crew members were killed. Flight 4U9525 departed Barcelona, Spain at 10:00 hours local time (09:00 UTC) on a regular passenger service to DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany. The flight reached its cruising altitude of FL380 at 10:27 hours. At 10:30 hours the flight was cleared direct to the IRMAR waypoint, which was confirmed by the flight: ""Direct IRMAR, Merci 18G."" This was the last radio contact with the flight. At 10:30:08, the captain told the co-pilot that he was leaving the cockpit and asked him to take over radio communications, which the co-pilot acknowledged. At 10:30:53, the selected altitude on the Flight Control Unit (FCU) changed in from 38,000 ft to 100 ft. One second later, the autopilot changed to OPEN DES mode and autothrust changed to THR IDLE mode. The airplane started to descend and both engines' speed decreased. At 10:33:12, the speed management changed from managed mode to selected mode. One second later, the selected target speed became 308 kt while the aeroplane's speed was 273 kt. The aeroplane's speed started to increase along with the descent rate, which subsequently varied between 1,700 ft/min and 5,000 ft/min, then was on average about 3,500 ft/min. The selected speed decreased to 288 kt. Then, over the following 13 seconds, the value of this target speed changed six times until it reached 302 kt.  At 10:33:47, the controller asked the flight crew what cruise level they were cleared for. The airplane was then at an altitude of 30,000 ft in descent. There was no answer from the co-pilot. Over the following 30 seconds, the controller tried to contact the flight crew again on two occasions, without any answer. Thereafter the selected speed increased up to 323 kt. Then the buzzer to request access to the cockpit sounded, but the copilot did not react. Marseille control centre kept attempting to contact the flight, without any response. The selected speed was again increased, this time to 350 kt. Meanwhile the captain attempted to call the copilot over the interphone and there were noises similar to a person knocking on the cockpit door. At the same time Marseille control and a controller from the French Air Defence system called the flight at various frequencies, without success. As the aircraft kept descending noises similar to violent blows on the cockpit door were recorded on five occasions between 10:39:30 and 10:40:28. The GPWS then sounded: ""Terrain, Terrain, Pull Up, Pull Up"" until the aircraft impacted a sloping rocky ravine in mountainous terrain at an elevation of 1550 meters. Causes: The collision with the ground was due to the deliberate and planned action of the co-pilot who decided to commit suicide while alone in the cockpit. The process for medical certification of pilots, in particular self-reporting in case of decrease in medical fitness between two periodic medical evaluations, did not succeed in preventing the co-pilot, who was experiencing mental disorder with psychotic symptoms, from exercising the privilege of his licence. The following factors may have contributed to the failure of this principle: - the co-pilot's probable fear of losing his ability to fly as a professional pilot if he had reported his decrease in medical fitness to an AME; - the potential financial consequences generated by the lack of specific insurance covering the risks of loss of income in case of unfitness to fly; - the lack of clear guidelines in German regulations on when a threat to public safety outweighs the requirements of medical confidentiality. Security requirements led to cockpit doors designed to resist forcible intrusion by unauthorized persons. This made it impossible to enter the flight compartment before the aircraft impacted the terrain in the French Alps.METAR: 08:30 UTC / 09:30 local time: LEBL 240830Z 05012KT 9000 -RA FEW020 SCT027 BKN045 12/10 Q1006 NOSIG09:00 UTC / 10:00 local time: LEBL 240900Z 05016KT 9999 FEW020 BKN045 12/10 Q1006 RERA NOSIGBarcelona Airport weather during takeoff: Wind 050 degrees at 16 knots; 10+ km visibility; few clouds at 2000 feet; broken clouds at 4500 feet; 12Â°C; dew point 10Â°C; Recent moderate/heavy rain09:30 UTC / 10:30 local time: LFML 240930Z 24006KT CAVOK 15/09 Q1008 NOSIGMarseille Airport weather: wind 240 degrees at 6 knots; 15Â°C, dew point 9Â°; CAVOK09:30 UTC / 10:30 local time: LEBL 240930Z 05015KT 8000 -RA FEW020 BKN045 13/11 Q1006 NOSIG10:00 UTC / 11:00 local time: LFML 241000Z 27005KT 9999 FEW033 BKN210 16/08 Q1008 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Report number: BEA2015-0125 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: List of aircraft accidents and incidents intentionally caused by pilots  Flightradar24  Task Force on Measures Following the Accident of Germanwings Flight 9525 / EASA, 17 July 2015  SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) Bureau d`EnquÃªtes et d`Analyses (BEA, France, www.bea.aero); near Barcelonette; 25 March 2015 photo (c) Flightradar24/Aviation Safety Network; near Barcelonette; 24 March 2015 photo (c) Bureau d`EnquÃªtes et d`Analyses (BEA, France, www.bea.aero); near Barcelonette photo (c) Bureau d`EnquÃªtes et d`Analyses (BEA, France, www.bea.aero); near Barcelonette photo (c) Bureau d`EnquÃªtes et d`Analyses (BEA, France, www.bea.aero); near Barcelonette; 25 March 2015 photo (c) Bureau d`EnquÃªtes et d`Analyses (BEA, France, www.bea.aero); near Barcelonette; 25 March 2015 photo (c) Bureau d`EnquÃªtes et d`Analyses (BEA, France, www.bea.aero); April 2015 photo (c) Bureau d`EnquÃªtes et d`Analyses (BEA, France, www.bea.aero); April 2015 photo (c) Bureau d`EnquÃªtes et d`Analyses (BEA, France, www.bea.aero); April 2015 photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Palma de Mallorca Airport (PMI/LEPA); 13 October 2014 photo (c) Jan MÃ¼nster; Hamburg-FuhlsbÃ¼ttel Airport (HAM/EDDH); 10 March 2015 photo (c) Timo Blossfeld; Berlin-Tegel Airport (TXL/EDDT); 29 March 2014 photo (c) Miklos SZABO; Wien-Schwechat International Airport (VIE/LOWW); 23 August 2013 photo (c) Gerhard Plomitzer; MÃ¼nchen-Franz Josef Strauss Airport (MUC/EDDM); 08 October 2010 photo (c) Stanley Page; London-Heathrow Airport (LHR/EGLL); 21 February 2015 photo (c) Giorgio Parolini; Milano-Malpensa Airport (MXP/LIMC); 02 September 2014 photo (c) RenÃ© Verschuur; BarcelonaâEl Prat Airport (BCN/LEBL); 09 August 2014 photo (c) Markus Schauhuber; Wien-Schwechat International Airport (VIE/LOWW); 20 March 2015 photo (c) Markus Schauhuber; Wien-Schwechat International Airport (VIE/LOWW); 20 March 2015 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates08-Jan-2025 19:05 ASN Updated [Departure airport, Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane sustained substantial damage. 23 occupants were injured. Flight 624 departed from Toronto at 21:05 hours local time (01:05 UTC). At 23:40 hours local time (02:40 UTC) the aircraft entered a holding pattern to the west of Halifax. Visibility was limited due to snowfall.  The aircraft was then cleared for a Localizer (LOC-Z) approach to runway 05 at Halifax Airport. During final approach the aircraft severed powerlines located 250 m from the beginning of the paved surface of runway 05. The aircraft then impacted a localizer antenna array, located 70 m further on, and became airborne again. The Airbus slid onto the runway and came to rest near taxiway B. The nose cone was ripped off in the accident sequence and pieces of the antenna array were embedded in the nose of plane. Part of the undercarriage were sheared off and both engines separated. There was extensive damage to both wing leading edges and horizontal stabilizers and lower fuselage. The last flight landing at Halifax before the accident was AC118, an Embraer 190 from Ottawa, at 21:50 hours local time. Two other incoming flights diverted and two were cancelled. Findings as to causes and contributing factors: 1. Air Canada's standard operating procedure (SOP) and practice when flying in flight path angle guidance mode was that, once the aircraft was past the final approach fix, the flight crews were not required to monitor the aircraft's altitude and distance from the threshold or to make any adjustments to the flight path angle. This practice was not in accordance with the flight crew operating manuals of Air Canada or Airbus. 2. As per Air Canada's practice, once the flight path angle was selected and the aircraft began to descend, the flight crew did not monitor the altitude and distance from the threshold, nor did they make any adjustments to the flight path angle. 3. The flight crew did not notice that the aircraft had drifted below and diverged from the planned vertical descent angle flight profile, nor were they aware that the aircraft had crossed the minimum descent altitude further back from the threshold. 4. Considering the challenging conditions to acquire and maintain the visual cues, it is likely the flight crew delayed disconnecting the autopilot until beyond the minimum descent altitude because of their reliance on the autopilot system. 5. The approach and runway lights were not changed from setting 4 to setting 5; therefore, these lights were not at their maximum brightness setting during the approach. 6. The system to control the airfield lighting's preset selections for brightness setting 4 was not in accordance with the NAV CANADA Air Traffic Control Manual of Operations requirement for the omnidirectional approach lighting system to be at its brightest settings. 7. The limited number of visual cues and the short time that they were available to the flight crew, combined with potential visual illusions and the reduced brightness of the approach and runway lights, diminished the flight crew's ability to detect that the aircraft's approach path was taking it short of the runway. 8. The flight crew's recognition that the aircraft was too low during the approach would have been delayed because of plan continuation bias. 9. The aircraft struck terrain approximately 740 feet short of the runway threshold, bounced twice, and then slid along the runway before coming to a rest approximately 1900 feet beyond the runway threshold. 10. At some time during the impact sequence, the captain's head struck the glare shield because there were insufficient acceleration forces to lock the shoulder harness and prevent movement of his upper body. 11. The first officer sustained a head injury and serious injury to the right eye as a result of striking the glare shield because the automatic locking feature of the right-side shoulder-harness inertia reel was unserviceable. 12. A flight attendant was injured by a coffee brewer that came free of its mounting base because its locking system was not correctly engaged. 13. Because no emergency was expected, the passengers and cabin crew were not in a brace position at the time of the initial impact. 14.

The accident is classified as a technical failure of the No. 4 wheel tire, a result of the aging process of the tire that resulted in the weakening of the ""insole reinforcement layer"" and the separation of the insole from the reinforcement layer, during the take-off run. The failure of wheel tire No. 4 started at a relatively high speed of a heavy plane and it created a chain process of load on the other wheels and high heat. Wheels 3 and 4 failed respectively (the fuses melted), due to the increase in temperature inside the tire and the air was released to prevent the tire from exploding.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIAI Report number: 33-15 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilots were not injured. The airplane was operated by a private company. Day, visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and an instrument flight rules flight plan was filed. The flight originated at Caracas-SimÃ³n BolÃ­var International Airport, Venezuela about 16:30. The pilot reported that the purpose of the flight was to fly the airplane to FXE for scheduled maintenance. About 2 hours and 15 minutes after departure, at flight level 430, the crew observed a red warning light indicating a maximum cabin differential pressure of 9.8 psi, followed by a red ""DOOR MAIN"" indication. The pilots donned oxygen masks and referenced the airplane's quick reference handbook. A loud ""bam"" sound was then heard in the cabin and the crew initiated an immediate descent. The cabin pressure outflow valve was opened manually and the airplane was leveled at 12,000 feet above mean sea level. The flight continued to FXE unpressurized and landed without further incident. After landing, the crew performed a walk-around inspection and found no obvious anomalies with the airplane. A subsequent inspection of the airplane by maintenance and engineering personnel revealed structural airframe damage, including a cracked floor beam, dimpled areas in the floor boards, damaged structure between ribs, and damaged wing links. An initial examination of the fuselage revealed that the outflow valve safety port, located on the outer fuselage, was completely plugged with a foreign material resembling dried dirt from a mud dauber. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The in-flight failure of the cabin pressurization relief/safety valve (CPRV) due to an obstruction of the CPRV static port, which allowed the airplane to overpressurize.

On the morning of the occurrence, CA66's first officer arrived at the airport at approximately 06:00. The first officer appeared to be in good spirits and spent about 5 minutes in the flight planning room before going to the aircraft to prepare it for that day's flights. The captain arrived at approximately 06:15 and went directly to the flight planning room to begin preparing the morning's flight plan. He appeared to be in a positive state of mind and spent a few minutes speaking with other company pilots who were also preparing to operate flights. He used a company computer to access weather information and placed a telephone call to NAV CANADA to file an instrument flight rules flight plan. No abnormal behaviour was observed by anyone with whom he had contact. The captain then walked to the aircraft and spent about 10 minutes in the flight deck before assisting the first officer with loading the flight's cargo. Final flight preparations were carried out by both flight crew members before they boarded the aircraft and started the engines, at about 06:45. At 07:03, CA66 began its take-off run. The aircraft lifted off after an approximate ground-run distance of 2800 to 3000 feet. This was within the expected normal performance for the aircraft type. Shortly after takeoff, CA66 contacted CYVR terminal departure control and was cleared to 9000 feet above sea level (ASL). A short time later, the air traffic controller assigned the flight a northbound heading. At 07:07, CYVR terminal departure control instructed CA66 to change radio frequencies and contact CYVR centre control. Upon initial contact with CYVR centre control, while climbing through 7500 feet, CA66 was again cleared to the aircraft's final flight planned altitude of flight level 200. At 07:08, the crew acknowledged a clearance to climb to flight level 200; this was CA66's last radio transmission. One minute and 20 seconds later, while climbing through an altitude of 8700 feet on an assigned heading of 350Â° magnetic, the aircraft disappeared from secondary surveillance radar displays at air traffic control. CA66's radar track, from the time it first became visible on radar at 07:02 until a steep descent toward ground, was approximately 7 minutes. The track showed an apparently routine climb from CYVR, at an average climb rate of 1500 feet per minute. Aircraft speed during the climb increased gradually until a ground speed of approximately 185 knots was reached. The last 3 radar returns from CA66 showed the aircraft beginning an abrupt, steep descent. At 07:09, a radar return showed that the aircraft was at 8700 feet; this was the highest altitude it reached. The 2 subsequent radar returns showed that the aircraft had dropped rapidly to 7600 feet and then 5000 feet while continuing in the direction of flight. There were no further returns. During the initial stage of the descent, the aircraft pitched down at about 6Â° per second, and its vertical acceleration reached -0.6g. The descent to 5000 feet likely occurred within 10 to 14 seconds. During that period, the aircraft's descent rate exceeded 30 000 feet per minute, and aerodynamic forces caused structural disintegration of the aircraft (in-flight breakup). There was no Mayday call or other communication from the aircraft during this period. Deteriorating weather conditions with low cloud and heavy snowfall hampered an air search; however, aircraft wreckage was found on steep, mountainous, snow-covered terrain by ground searchers at approximately 16:45. Both pilots had been fatally injured. Investigation showed that the captain had 0.24% blood alcohol content [BAC]. To obtain this, the captain would have had to consume approximately 17 to 20 standard drinks over a 12-hour period.  An autopsy also identified focal severe coronary artery atherosclerosis and both steatosis and hepatitis in the captainÂs liver. Finding these conditions in a 34-year-old person suggests excessive alcohol consumption over a significant period. The captain had recently applied for the position of Vancouver base chief pilot for the companyÂs cargo operation. On 26 March 2015, the company advised him that the position had been awarded to another candidate. Around the same period, on 24 March 2015, 20 days before this accident, a first officer who had been having symptoms of depression and psychosis deliberately flew a Germanwings Airbus A320 into terrain, killing all on board. Although there were several coincidental factors, the investigation could not make any conclusions about the captainÂs predisposition to committing an intentional act. Other scenario's like pitot system blockage or crew incapacitation were also considered, but deemed not very probable. Findings as to causes and contributing factors: 1. For unknown reasons, the aircraft descended in the direction of flight at high speed until it exceeded its structural limits, leading to an in-flight breakup. 2. Based on the captain's blood alcohol content, alcohol intoxication almost certainly played a role in the events leading up to the accident.METAR: 13:46 UTC / 06:46 local time: SPECI CYVR 131346Z 09008KT 15SM -RA FEW033 SCT056 OVC069 07/04 A2989 RMK SC2SC2AC4 SLP12314:00 UTC / 07:00 local time: CYVR 131400Z 15004KT 090V190 15SM -RA FEW033 SCT042 BKN054 OVC069 07/04 A2990 RMK SC2SC2SC3AC1 SLP124Wind 150 degrees at 4 knots, carying 90-190 degrees; visibility: 15 miles; rain; Few clouds at 3300 feet; Scattered clouds at 4200 feet; Broken clouds at 5400 feet; Overcast at 6900 feet; Temp. 7Â°C; Dew point 4Â°CAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A15P0081 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Flightaware History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  19 May 2000 N235BA Superior Aviation 0 Denver International Airport, CO (DEN) sub 20 February 2006 N235BA Superior Aviation 0 Casper, WY min Location  Images: photo (c) TSB; near Vancouver, BC; 14 April 2015 photo (c) TSB; near Vancouver, BC; 14 April 2015 photo (c) TSB; Vancouver, BC; 23 April 2015 photo (c) TSB; near Vancouver, BC; 13 April 2015 photo (c) TSB; near Vancouver, BC; 13 April 2015 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight was cleared for a runway 28 RNAV (GNSS) approach. During the approach a local transient fog layer moved over the airport. The Runway Visual Range in the touchdown zone decreased rapidly as low as 350 m. After that, the value recovered and returned to the value of more than 1,800 m. After the pilot in command and the first officer talked that the appearance of the runway was slightly odd, Hiroshima Tower reported a Touchdown RVR of 1,700 m. After that the captain disengaged the autopilot. At that time the aircraft was flying at 1000 feet above airfield elevation.  The aircraft then descended below the normal 3Â° glide path. At decision altitude, the captain called, ""Continue,"" and continued descending. Immediately after this, the first officer concernedly said, ""Runway was not in sight."" At this stage, the approach path was getting even lower but still remained uncorrected.  The captain said, ""Wait a second,"" as the aircraft descended to a position which indicated four red lights on the PAPI, if visible. The captain instructed the first officer to check radio altitude carefully. Afterward, an Auto Radio Altitude call of ""300 ft"" and ""200 ft"" were announced in a short interval, then, the captain called out for executing a go-around, and commenced raising the nose. Accordingly, the pitch angle of the aircraft was just about to increase; however, immediately after that, the aircraft collided with the Localizer antenna array, which is located 325 m before the runway 28 threshold.  The aircraft collided with the central parts of the LOC frame stand 6 m high with the both engines, both main landing gears, the flaps, the lower surface of fuselage and the horizontal stabilizers. Having collided with the LOC frame stand, the aircraft badly damaged lights of SALS and touched down on the grass area short of the runway 28 threshold with the fuselage tail, followed by the right and left main wheels followed. The aircraft smashed down ORL lights and proceeded on the runway. The left main gear folded due to severe damage, causing the left engine cowling to touch the runway surface. Subsequently, the airplane gradually veered off the runway to the left finally coming to a stop facing the southeast at the position in front of the airport boundary fence. When the purser came into the cockpit, she was told to wait and the captain gave priority to performing the Emergency Evacuation Checklist. Back in the cabin she heard flight attendants in the rear of the cabin calling and it seemed that smoke was coming up in the rear. She decided that an emergency evacuation was required, and proceeded to the forward left hand (L1) door. Having confirmed the inflation of the evacuation slide, she instructed the passengers to evacuate. The flight attendants then also began evacuating the passengers. All persons onboard were evacuated using the emergency slides and 27 persons suffered minor injuries. Probable Causes: It is certain that when landing on runway 28 at Hiroshima airport, the aircraft undershot and the PIC commenced executing a go-around; however, it collided with the Aeronautical Radio Navigation Aids located in front of runway 28 threshold, just before turning to climb.  Regarding the fact that the aircraft undershot, it is probable that there might be following aspects in causes: The PIC continued approaching without executing a goaround while the position of the aircraft could not be identified by visual references which should have been in view and identified continuously at or below the approach height threshold (Decision Altitude: DA); and as well, the first officer, as pilot-monitoring who should have monitored meteorological conditions and flight operations, did not make a call-out of go-around immediately when he could not see the runway at DA.  Regarding the fact that the PIC continued approaching without executing a goaround while the position of the aircraft could not be identified by visual references which should have been in view and identified continuously at or below DA, he did not comply with the regulations and Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), and it is probable that there was a background factor that the education and trainings for compliance of rules in the company was insufficient. In addition, regarding the fact that the first officer did not make an assertion of go-around, it is probable that the Crew Resource Management (CRM) did not function appropriatelyMETAR: 11:00 UTC / 20:00 local time: RJOA 141100Z VRB02KT 6000 -SHRA PRFG FEW000 SCT012 BKN020 09/08 Q100611:08 UTC / 20:08 local time: RJOA 141108Z VRB02KT 4000 R28/0300VP1800D -SHRA PRFG FEW000 SCT005 BKN012 09/08 Q1006 RMK 1ST000 4ST005 6CU012 A2973 1500E FG E-SWind, variable 2 knots: Visivility 4000 m: RVR, runway 28, variable between 300m and 1800m, downward: light shower of rain, partial fog: Cloud layers, 1 okta 0ft, 4 oktas 500ft, 6 oktas 1200ft: Temperature, 9 degree-Celsius: Dew-point, 8 degree-Celsius: QNH, 1006 hPa/2973 INS: Remark, Visibility 1500m for east quadrant, fog located from east to south.11:18 UTC / 20:18 local time: RJOA 141118Z 15003KT 5000 PRFG BR FEW000 SCT005 BKN012 09/09 Q1007 RMK 1ST000 4ST005 6CU012 A2974 FG BANK E-SAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: JTSB Report number: AA2016-9 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) K.Kouda; Hiroshima International Airport (HIJ); 09 June 2015 photo (c) JTSB; Hiroshima International Airport (HIJ); April 2015 photo (c) JTSB; Hiroshima International Airport (HIJ); April 2015 photo (c) JTSB; Hiroshima International Airport (HIJ); April 2015 photo (c) JTSB; Hiroshima International Airport (HIJ); 14 April 2015 photo (c) JTSB; Hiroshima International Airport (HIJ); 14 April 2015 photo (c) Felix Goetting; Beijing-Capital Airport (PEK/ZBAA); 17 October 2012 photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Seoul-Incheon International Airport (ICN/RKSI); 06 January 2009 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot was not injured. Dark night instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) prevailed at the time of the accident and an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan had been filed for the cargo flight. The airplane departed from Garfield County Regional Airport (RIL), Colorado, at 22:37 and was destined for Denver International Airport (DEN), Colorado The pilot reported that during climb, when still well below the tops of nearby mountains, he heard a ""bang"" followed by a complete loss of power and engine fire indications from the right engine. After completing appropriate checklist items the pilot declared an emergency and diverted to Grand Junction Regional Airport (GJT), Colorado, for an instrument approach and an otherwise uneventful landing at 23:11. A postaccident examination of the airplane revealed the second stage turbine rotor from the right engine had separated. One portion of the rotor exited through the left side of the engine and nacelle structure, penetrated the right side of the fuselage, and came to rest inside the fuselage wall.

There were no significant injuries to the crew. Post-flight engineering analysis revealed that the mishap aircraft exceeded the Design Limit Load (DLL), thus rendering it unsafe for further flight.  The mishap occurred on a medium risk flying qualities test sortie out to the edges of the flight envelope. The pilot was attempting to execute a Steady Heading Sideslip (SHSS) to the RUDDER Special Alert of the Advisory Caution and Warning System (ACAWS). This is normally a prohibited maneuver, but the Director of Operations at Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC/A3) signed a waiver approving the test team to fly to this limit. The MA exceeded 14.5Â° Angle of Sideslip (AoS), triggering the RUDDER Special Alert and continued increasing AoS until it departed controlled flight, eventually tumbling to an inverted position. Shortly thereafter, the aircraft recovered from the departure and the copilot took the controls to recover from the near vertical dive. In the process of the departure and recovery, the aircraft lost approximately 5,000 feet of altitude, experienced 3.19 times the normal force acceleration (Gs), and over sped the flaps by over 100 knots. The over G exceeded the aircraft's Design Limit Load. The Accident Investigation Board (AIB) President found, by a preponderance of the evidence, the cause of this mishap was the MP's [Mishap Pilot's] excessive rudder input during the test point followed by inadequate rudder input to initiate a timely recovery from high AoS due to Overcontrolled/Undercontrolled Aircraft and Wrong Choice of Action During an Operation. Additionally, the AIB President found, by a preponderance of the evidence, the following factors substantially contributed to the mishap: Instrumentation and Warning System Issues, Spatial Disorientation, Confusion, and the fact the test team was Provided Inadequate Procedural Guidance or Publications.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: USAF AIB Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

With the target approximately 40 m from the aircraft, the target winch accelerated rapidly and the target struck the leading edge of the wing before detaching and travelling over the wing. Although, the launcher and the droop leading edge on the wing were damaged, the aircraft landed safely. The target winch is powered by a turbine, and the speed of the turbine is controlled by vent doors. The target winch had oversped due to a fault with the closed limit switch on the vent doors which prevented the doors from closing. The target accelerated during the latter stages of its recovery, causing it to strike the aircraft. The acceleration was probably due to an overspeed of the target winch as a result of the failure of the vent door closed limit switch preventing the vent doors from closing when commanded. The turbine would then have spooled up, increasing the torque and resulting in the winch accelerating.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: EW/C2015/04/05 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  14 November 2023 G-FRAK Draken Europe 0 S of Exeter non Loss of control Images: photo (c) AAIB; 2015 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft and its crew were conducting a routine training mission in support of an Air Force Special Operations Command exercise. The crew consisted of cockpit crew, electronic warfare officers, intelligence operators and in-flight maintenance technicians. The pilot aborted the takeoff, and all crew members safely evacuated the aircraft. Four crewmembers received treatment for minor smoke inhalation. Fire crews arrived at approximately 18:29 and extinguished the flames. The fire burned a hole through the upper fuselage above the rear galley area of the aircraft, causing structural damage and damage to aircraft control and mission related systems. Repair cost to the aircraft is estimated at $62.4 million. The board president found by preponderance of the evidence that the cause of the mishap was a leak in the high-pressure oxygen system due to poor assembly of the system tubing at depot maintenance. Failure by L3 Communications depot maintenance personnel to tighten a retaining nut connecting a metal oxygen tube to a junction fitting above the galley properly caused an oxygen leak. This leak created a highly flammable oxygen-rich environment that ignited. The resulting fire melted the retaining nut causing the tubing to become detached from the junction fitting, feeding more oxygen to the fire, increasing its size, and causing severe damage to the airframe, galley, and mission equipment onboard the aircraft.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: USAF AIB Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) U.S. Air Force; Bellevue-Offutt AFB, NE (OFF); 2015; (publicdomain) photo (c) U.S. Air Force; Bellevue-Offutt AFB, NE (OFF); 2015; (publicdomain) photo (c) U.S. Air Force; Bellevue-Offutt AFB, NE (OFF); 2015; (publicdomain) photo (c) U.S. Air Force; Bellevue-Offutt AFB, NE (OFF); 2015; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

Flight 5612 was operating under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Par 121 as a regularly scheduled passenger flight from Albuquerque International Sunport (KABQ), Albuquerque, New Mexico, to KPHX.  After landing in KABQ, the crew were notified via ACARS that their arrival gate had changed from B7 to B21.Â  After arriving at the gate area, the crew inadvertently lined up with gate B23 and awaited marshallers.Â  As the marshallers arrived, the crew noticed that they were aligned with the wrong gate and that a left turn to enter gate B21 was not possible due to ground obstructions. As a result, the flight crew decided to perform a right turn to return to the ramp area and then enter gate B23.Â  The B757 was parked to the right of the CRJ900 at gate B25, and was aligned at about a 45 degree angle relative to the other parking configurations. As they reached approximately 90 degrees in the turn, the first officer (FO) advised the captain they were getting too close to the wing of the B757.Â  The captain proceeded to slowly complete the right turn to exit the gate but the flight crew then felt a shudder and the FO noted possible damage to the winglet of the B757.Â  The CRJ900 continued its taxi to the proper gate and all passengers deplaned normally.Â  After engine shutdown, the captain exited the airplane to assess any damage to the CRJ900 and noticed the horizontal stabilizer leading edge was substantially damaged.

Two of the six crew members survived the accident. The aircraft took off from runway 09 at 12:54 hours local time. The pilot, co-pilot, a mechanic and three engineers were conducting a test flight from Sevilla Airport (SVQ). The aircraft was built at the Airbus plant at Sevilla and was intended for the Turkish Air Force. It was the maiden flight after assembly. Shortly after takeoff three of the four engines became stuck at high power. Initially the three engines did not respond to the crewÂs attempts to control the power setting in the normal way. Pilots then succeeded in reducing power only after selecting the thrust levers to idle. Then the engines remained stuck at idle. In an attempt to return to the airport, the aircraft struck powerlines, impacted a field and burned. An Airbus official after the accident stated that engine control software was incorrectly installed during final assembly of the aircraft. This led to engine failure and the resulting crash.METAR: 10:30 UTC / 12:30 local time: LEZL 091030Z 07010KT 030V090 CAVOK 27/09 Q1022 NOSIG11:00 UTC / 13:00 local time: LEZL 091100Z 05009KT CAVOK 28/09 Q1022 NOSIG Sources: Flightradar24  El Pais  Airbus Defence and Space   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Before departure, the pilot and copilot completed a preflight inspection of the airplane and found everything to be normal. After taking off without incident, the flight crew started running the after takeoff checklist and the pilot moved the landing gear selector handle to the up position. The crew then felt and heard a loud ""clank"" in the nose of the airplane and observed that the red or unsafe nose gear light had illuminated; recycling the landing gear handle had the same result. As the flight crew returned to the departure airport, they selected the landing gear handle to the down position and received three green landing gear down indications and completed the before landing checklist; the air traffic controller advised that the nose landing gear appeared to be straight. During the landing, the airplane touched down on the main wheels first, but once the nosewheel touched down and weight was on the nose landing gear, the airplane suddenly turned sharply 30Â° to 40Â° to the left and application of right rudder did not counter the turn. The airplane then partially traveled off the left side of the runway pavement, its left main landing gear struck a concrete runway edge-light base, then the airplane turned about 180Â° from its original direction of travel and came to rest on the left side of the runway about 1,500 ft from the end of the runway. Probable Cause and Findings: The flight crewÂs inadequate preflight inspection of the nose landing gear strut, which resulted in the nosewheel not being aligned during retraction and the subsequent loss of directional control. Contributing to the accident was the failure of the nose landing gear strut due to inadequate pressure and excessive wear.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 years and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot was not injured. The cross-country personal flight departed Palm Springs, California, about 15:15 with a planned destination of Santa Ana, California. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed. The pilot reported that 10 minutes into the flight, he received an instrument flight rules flight plan from air traffic control (ATC). The cloud tops were at 8,500 feet and he was cleared to 6,000 ft, which put him in the clouds. Within minutes of entering the clouds, the airplane lost all electrical power, and the pilot lost contact with ATC. He climbed back out of the clouds and proceeded to the west; he found a hole in the clouds over the Pacific Ocean, descended, and turned southbound. He said partial electrical power was restored, and he tried to advise ATC of his problems. His transmissions were not understood, but he flew to Carlsbad, and received a green light from the tower personnel. He extended the landing gear and flaps but had no airspeed indicator. When the airplane touched down, the pilot realized that his landing gear had not extended. Witnesses reported that the airplane approached the runway and was faster than a normal landing, and the gear was still retracted. The pilot reported that after the loss of electrical power he did not perform any emergency procedures as the checklist was in a cabinet and not reachable; he was just trying to fly the airplane. The pilot stated that when he departed from Palm Springs, the generators were on. When asked if he attempted to reset the generators, he again stated that he did not do any emergency procedures except to fly the airplane. In a later interview, the pilot stated that he may have accidently turned on the starter switches, which would have turned off the generators and accounted for the loss of electrical power. A mechanic was dispatched to help defuel the airplane about 30 minutes after the accident. He reported that fuel was leaking from the right wing so he disconnected the battery. He opened an access panel but was unable to mechanically turn off the fuel selector valve (FSV). He reconnected the battery and went into the cockpit. He saw that the landing gear handle was in the down position, and the flap handle was in the full up position. The battery switch was in the OFF position with the battery gang bar down, which turned off the battery, generator 1, and generator 2. After lifting up the gang bar and turning on the battery switch, he saw nothing on the cockpit displays but heard the airplane power up. He located the FSV, turned it off, and confirmed with a firefighter that the solenoid in the wing audibly closed. The mechanic turned the electrical power off and disconnected the battery. The fuel leak from the right engine filter bowl stopped. It took the mechanic about 30 minutes to gather the equipment needed to defuel the airplane, and he decided to start with the right side by connecting to the engine supply line. He reconnected the battery and entered the cockpit to turn on the electrical power. With power on, the cockpit displays illuminated, and he heard the landing gear try to operate to the down position. After another mechanic pulled the circuit breaker for the avionics, he defueled the airplane. During recovery, the airplane was lifted off the ground, and the landing gear were successfully extended to the down and locked position. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The pilot's inadvertently turning on the starter switches, which turned off the generators and resulted in a loss of electrical power and gear-up landing. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's failure to follow the emergency procedures for a loss of electrical power or to manually extend the landing gear.

The aircraft was on a positioning flight from Kevsala (Ipatovo district of the Stavropol region) to Gribnoye, carrying four drums of oil. While flying at low altitude the engine failed. The pilot carried out a forced landing at Sanamer. The aircraft ran over a fence and came to rest against a church. The airplane did not have a valid Certificate of Airworthiness at the time of the accident. Conclusion (translated from Russian): The aircraft accident with the aircraft An-2s/x RA-56528 occurred due to the collision of the aircraft with an obstacle during the forced landing. The necessity of the forced landing was caused by the engine self-absorption during the flight, most probably due to the oil tank bloating and its wall pressing on the engine stop-crane lever on the carburetor. The increase in pressure in the oil tank and its bloating were the result of deposits of soot in the drainage pipe connecting the oil tank with the atmosphere.  Contributing factors: - Absence of the tank flushing, including the tank drainage pipeline with the atmosphere provided for by the periodic maintenance after 400Â±30 hours of flight or 12Â±1 month of operation; - Maintenance of aircraft by persons who do not have a certificate of a maintenance and repair specialist; - performance of the flight over the locality at an altitude that does not allow landing outside the locality in case of aircraft malfunction; - performance of the flight by an aircraft under the influence of alcoholic intoxication of the average degree.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: MAK  Southern Investigative Department of the Investigative Committee on Transport of the Russian Federation  Lifenews.ru   Location  Images: photo (c) Interstate Aviation Committee; Sanamer, Stavropol Territory; 18 May 2015 photo (c) Interstate Aviation Committee; Sanamer, Stavropol Territory; 18 May 2015 photo (c) Interstate Aviation Committee; Sanamer, Stavropol Territory; 18 May 2015 photo (c) Interstate Aviation Committee; Sanamer, Stavropol Territory; 18 May 2015 photo (c) Interstate Aviation Committee; Sanamer, Stavropol Territory; 18 May 2015 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

At 08:32 hrs G-LGNL was cleared to enter runway 18 at Stornoway Airport and take off, and the ATC controller transmitted that the surface wind was from 270Â° at 27 kt. The commander commented to the co-pilot that the wind was across the runway and that there was no tailwind. As the aircraft taxied onto the runway, the co-pilot applied almost full right aileron input consistent with a cross-wind from the right, and the commander said to the co-pilot ""charlie , one hundred, strong wind from the right"". The commander advanced the power levers, the co-pilot said ""autocoarsen high"" and the engine torques increased symmetrically. The commander instructed the co-pilot to ""set takeoff power"" to which the co-pilot replied ""apr armed"". Approximately one second after this call, the engine torques began to increase symmetrically, reaching 100% as the aircraft accelerated through 70 kt. During the early stages of the takeoff, left rudder was applied and the aircraft maintained an approximately constant heading. As the aircraft continued accelerating, the rudder was centralised, after which there was a small heading change to the left, then to the right, then a rapid heading change to the left causing the aircraft to deviate to the left of the runway centreline. The pilot applied right rudder but although the aircraft changed heading to the right in response, it did not alter the aircraftÂs track significantly and the aircraft skidded to the left, departing the runway surface onto the grass at an IAS of 80 kt. The power levers remained at full power as the aircraft crossed a disused runway and back onto grass. During this period the nose landing gear collapsed before the aircraft came to a halt approximately 38 m left of the edge of the runway and 250 m from where it first left the paved surface. After the aircraft came to a halt, the captain saw that the propellers were still turning and so called into the cabin for the passengers to remain seated. One of the passengers shouted for someone to open the emergency exit but the cabin crew member instructed the passengers not to do so because the propellers were still turning. The co-pilot observed that the right propeller was still turning so operated the engine fire extinguishers to shut down both engines. When the passenger seated in the emergency exit row on the right of the aircraft saw that the right propeller had stopped, he decided to open the exit. He climbed out onto the wing and helped the remaining passengers leave the aircraft through the same exit, instructing them to slide off the rear of the wing onto the ground. The left propeller was still turning at the time the right over-wing exit was opened and the passenger seated in the left-side emergency exit row decided not to open the left exit. The technique for controlling the direction of the aircraft on the runway is to use rudder assisted by nose wheel steering (NWS) at low speeds because the rudder has reduced effectiveness below 40 kt. When rudder is used, the requirement for NWS to assist directional control will reduce progressively as speed increases above 40 kt and rudder effectiveness increases. It is likely that no assistance will be required by 60 kt and, therefore, there will be no step-change in NWS directional effect when the pilot releases the steering control. During this attempted takeoff, rudder was approximately neutral from 40 kt, the point at which it would have become effective, and directional control was probably maintained through NWS alone (asymmetric thrust or differential braking having been discounted). If rudder had been applied, there would have been a reduced NWS requirement at any given speed and therefore there would have been a reduced likelihood of a change directional effect when the NWS control was released. The lack of data showing NWS commands meant that these considerations could not be verified. PROBABLE CAUSE: The investigation report did not contain a probable cause paragraph as recommended in ICAO Annex 13.METAR: 07:50 UTC / 07:50 local time: EGPO 020750Z 27019KT 9999 VCSH FEW015CB SCT042 05/02 Q100708:20 UTC / 08:20 local time: EGPO 020820Z 27022G33KT 9999 VCSH FEW015CB SCT040 05/01 Q1008Windes from 270 degrees at 22 knots, gusting to 33 knots; Visibility: 10+ km; showers in vicinity; few CB clouds at 1500 feet AGL; scattered clouds at 4000 feet AGL; Temperature: 5Â°C; Dewpoint: 1Â°C; Pressure: 1008 mb08:50 UTC / 08:50 local time: EGPO 020850Z 26018KT 9999 VCSH FEW015CB SCT018 05/01 Q1009Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: EW/C2015/01/01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: BBC  Loganair  SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) AAIB; Edinburgh-Turnhouse Airport (EDI/EGPH); 21 May 2009 photo (c) Rafboy15; Edinburgh-Turnhouse Airport (EDI/EGPH); 21 May 2009; (CC:by) photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Dublin Airport (DUB/EIDW); 28 July 2013 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight to Matthews Ridge was uneventful until the final approach to land. The aircraft approached the runway from the left and had to make a steep bank in an attempt to establish on the runway centerline. The aircraft was slow in the turn and was possibly further slowed by the steep bank causing the aircraft to exhibit the characteristics of an imminent accelerated stall. This forced the aircraft's rate of sink to increase and the pilot was unable to stabilize the aircraft's approach. The aircraft's port wing touched the ground first, followed by the port undercarriage. There were no injuries or fatalities. Cause: The probable cause of the accident was that the aircraft was slow and close to the threshold on left base of RWY29. The pilot executed and maintained a steep left turn which resulted in the aircraft experiencing an incipient accelerated stall. Contributory Causes: 1. The approach to landing was not properly configured, which resulted in an unsafe and unstable approach. 2. Although he felt the aircraft buffeting, the pilot did not recognize that there was an impending accelerated stall and did not react in a timely manner to correct it. 3. The weather was not conducive to VFR operations. 4. Given the prevailing weather conditions, the pilot should not have descended below the MSA of 3000ft. 5. It is believed that the pilot may have established a mindset to land because another pilot had landed four minutes earlier.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: GCAA-AIT Report number: GCAA: 2/5/1/78 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

On board were the flight crew of two and approximately 4,600 kg of freight.  The flight crew carried out the pre-start checklist and then started the right engine, after which the ground crew were given the signal to disconnect the ground power unit (GPU), positioned directly in front of the aircraft. The commander expected to see the GPU being moved clear of the aircraft, but when this did not happen he signaled the left engine start to the ground crew, which was approved. With the left engine started, the commander signaled for the nosewheel chocks to be removed, which was actioned by the ground crew. Immediately the chocks were removed, the aircraft began to move forward and the first officer saw the ground crew member run clear of the aircraft to the right. Both flight crew members immediately applied wheel brakes, but as they did so, the aircraft collided with the GPU. The flight crew shut down both engines and informed ATC. There were no injuries and damage was confined to forward parts of the aircraft and the top cover of the GPU. After the accident the flight crew realised that the parking brake was not set, resulting in the aircraftÂs movement when the chocks were removed. The commander noted that there had been an expectation that the parking brake would have been set to on when the crew first arrived at the aircraft. The parking brake was not an item on the turnaround checklist which the crew had carried out earlier, although it was an item on the pre-start checklist which had therefore not been carried out correctly. The commander also observed that the signal to remove the chocks was given before the GPU had been moved clear of the aircraft. Although the flight crew had not felt rushed, the commander believed that they had been under a time pressure due to the imminent airport closure, and that this had been a contributory factor.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: EW/G2015/01/05 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  11 March 2021 SE-MAI West Air Sweden 0 near East Midlands Airport, Castle Donington, Leicestershire non Fumes/smoke/odor event Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The sixteen occupants of the plane were not injured. Executive Secretary Paquito Ochoa and Communications Secretary Herminio Coloma Jr. were on board the private jet that departed following the visit of Pope Francis to Tacloban. Due to the approaching Tropical Storm Amang (Mekkhala) the Papal visit was cut short and all aircraft were prepared for departure. At 13:04 hours, the Global 5000 was given start up clearance by tower controller and subsequently a taxi clearance at 13:08 to exit via the south taxiway next to a departing Airbus A320 carrying the Papal entourage. Prevailing wind condition were 290Â° with a 18 knots crosswind and temperature of 24Â° . The airplane then had to wait for another A320 to depart at 13:22, which took-off with prevailing wind conditions of 290Â° with a 23 kts crosswind.  At 13:35 the Global 5000 was finally cleared for take-off from runway 36. The wind condition at that time was 300Â° at 18 kts with gustiness and a temperature of 24Â°. The aircrew performed a rolling take-off and the acceleration was normal, the pilot nonflying (NPF) called for air speed alive, 80 knots, V1 and Rotate. Before approaching the south taxiway abeam the terminal building, the aircraft started to veer to the left side of the runway centerline. The aircraft continued to roll veering to the left side of the runway and the left hand main landing gear was already out of the runway after the north taxiway. The aircraft suffered a runway excursion and sustained substantial damage after simultaneous collision with the concrete bases of runway edge lights and to the concrete culvert before it came to a complete stop at approximately 1500 meters from the take-off point. PROBABLE CAUSE: The Aircraft Accident Investigation and Inquiry Board determined that the probable cause of this accident was:  - Lack of recurrent training of the flight crew Routine flights do not prepare a pilot for unusual situations, whether they are unexpected crosswinds or systems/engine anomalies. Pilots should receive regular recurrent training to include abnormal and emergency procedures. - The existing runway edge light design The PIC tried to recover the aircraft back to the runway but apparently the aircraft left main landing gears already hit or bumped the concrete base of runway edge lights. The design of runway strips or shoulder must be free from fixed objects other than frangible visual aids provided for the guidance of aircraft and must notbe constructed with sharp edges; and where the lights will not normally come into contact with aircraft wheels, such as threshold lights, runway end lights and runway edge lights; - Human Factors Due to deteriorating adverse weather conditions and due to the delay of their initial request for take-off clearance plus the sudden change of flight plan affected the CaptainÂs ability to perform a take-off procedure as recommended in the aircraft flight manual and instead delegated flight control duties to the F/O resulting in the loss of coordination between the flight crew.Sources: GMA News   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Swiss International Air Lines flight LX1189 was preparing for departure to Zurich, Switzerland and the doors of the aircraft were closed. The aircraft was being de-iced when the de-icing employee heard the APU revving up. This was followed by a loud bang. After a second loud bang the APU stopped. Debris from the APU engine penetrated the pressure bulkhead and smoke appeared in the passenger cabin. The passengers were directed to the front of the cabin and all occupants left the plane through the forward exit. The APU air intake is located on the right of the fuselage, on the transition from the fin to the fuselage. De-icing fluid can easily enter through the open air intake when the APU is in operation. Furthermore, the de-icing agent causes a strong fog when applied, due to the difference in temperature. This restricts the visibility of the air intake. In addition, the area around the air inlet of the APU is not marked, making it harder to notice the location of the intake. The BFU notes that a safety recommendation of the NTSB following a similar accident, requested the APU to be switched off when the aircraft is de-iced. This measure had not been implemented in Europe. Conclusions: The failure of the APU and the resulting consequential damage was due to the intake and combustion of de-icing fluid. Visual restrictions and inadequate marking have contributed to the accident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: BFU Report number: BFU AX001-15 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years Download report:  Final report Sources: BFU AX001-15 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  4 September 2003 N1450A American Airlines 0 New York-La Guardia Airport, NY (LGA/KLGA) sub Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Sky Express flight GQ100 was a domestic passenger flight from Heraklion on the Greek island of Crete to the island of Rhodes. The aircraft took off at 07:00 hours local time. Prior to departure the flight crew had been briefed that in the area of the Rhodes Airport the winds were S-SE at 17 kt with wind gust to 36 kt. For winds like these, the Rhodes (LGRP) AIP stated: ""Pilots landing or taking off at RODOS/ DIAGORAS Airport should exercise extreme caution when South or SouthEast (S-SE) winds of more than 15 Kts prevail, as moderate or severe turbulence and wind shear may be encountered on the final approach and/or initial climb out areas (mainly of RWY 07)."" At 07:23 hrs., approximately 12 min prior to landing, in the first contact of the flight crew with the Control Tower of Rhodes Airport, the flight crew was told winds were variable with a direction from 20Â° to 160Â°, average wind direction from 110Â°, wind velocity 20 kt gusting 38 kt. As laid down in the airport procedures, ATC, given the weather conditions, alerted the fire service vehicles to be stationed in readiness at their designated positions on the taxiways. Rhodes ATC then reminded the flight crew that as a result of the strong wind shear and turbulence, landing at the airport was not recommended under the circumstances. At 07:29 Rhodes ATC contacted the flight, informing that the wind was shifting from 40Â° to 260Â°, average wind direction from 120Â°, mean wind velocity 20 kt and wind gust 32 kt. Three minutes later, at about 8 nm from the airport, ATC contacted the flight crew again and informed that wind in the last ten minutes was shifting in all directions, with mean wind velocity 16 kt and wind gust 37 kt; ATC also repeated that under these conditions landing was not recommended. At 07:34, at about 4 nm to the airport, Rhodes ATC gave the crew a weather update: wind was shifting from 60Â° to 200Â°, mean wind velocity 15 kt, wind gust 32 kt and runway 07 was free for landing. One minute later ATC reported wind direction from 110Â°, 17kt. Given the prevailing winds, landing with 9Â° flaps and an airspeed of about 129 kt was selected by the crew. The flight continued to land and touched down at 07:36, with the right main landing gear touching down first. During deceleration immediately after touchdown, the aircraft veered to the left and came to rest at the left edge of the runway without exiting the runway. Probable Causes:  The decision to perform a landing following a non-stabilized approach. Landing with a strong and variable wind, the speed and the crosswind component of which were in excess of the values specified by the standard operating procedures, the aircraft manufacturer and the recommendations for the said aerodrome in AIP GREECE.

A TransAsia ATR-72-600 operating as flight GE235 from Taipei to Kinmen Island impacted a highway viaduct and the waters of the Keelung River near New Taipei City shortly after takeoff. Forty-three occupants on board the airplane suffered fatal injuries. Fifteen were injured. The airplane took off from Taipei-Sung Shan Airport's runway 10 at 10:51 hours local time and turned right, climbing to an altitude of 1350 feet. At 10:52 the master warning sounded in the cockpit associated with the right engine (no. 2) flame out procedure message. Some 26 seconds later the left hand (no. 1) power lever was retarded to flight idle. After twenty seconds the left engine condition lever was set to the fuel shutoff position resulting in left engine shutdown. Instead of continuing the climbing right hand turn, the airplane had turned left and began losing altitude and speed with several stall warnings sounding in the cockpit. At 10:53, the flight contacted the Sung Shan Tower controller declaring a Mayday and reporting an 'engine flameout'. The airplane then turned to the right while the crew attempted to restart the left hand engine. This succeeded at 10:54:20 hours. Fourteen seconds later the stall warning sounded in the cockpit. Video footage of the accident show that the airplane banked almost 90 degrees left as it hit a taxi on a viaduct. Parts of the left hand wing broke off upon hitting the barrier of the viaduct. The airplane broke up as it impacted the Keelung River and came to rest inverted. Findings Related to Probable Causes: Powerplant 1. An intermittent signal discontinuity between the auto feather unit (AFU) number 2 and the torque sensor may have caused the automatic take off power control system (ATPCS): - Not being armed steadily during takeoff roll; - Being activated during initial climb which resulted in a complete ATPCS sequence including the engine number 2 autofeathering.  2. The available evidence indicated the intermittent discontinuity between torque sensor and auto feather unit (AFU) number 2 was probably caused by the compromised soldering joints inside the AFU number 2.  Flight Operations 3. The flight crew did not reject the take off when the automatic take off power control system ARM pushbutton did not light during the initial stages of the take off roll. 4. TransAsia did not have a clear documented company policy with associated instructions, procedures, and notices to crew for ATR72-600 operations communicating the requirement to reject the take off if the automatic take off power control system did not arm.  5. Following the uncommanded autofeather of engine number 2, the flight crew failed to perform the documented failure identification procedure before executing any actions. That resulted in pilot flying's confusion regarding the identification and nature of the actual propulsion system malfunction and he reduced power on the operative engine number 1.  6. The flight crew's non-compliance with TransAsia Airways ATR72-600 standard operating procedures - Abnormal and Emergency Procedures for an engine flame out at take off resulted in the pilot flying reducing power on and then shutting down the wrong engine.  7. The loss of engine power during the initial climb and inappropriate flight control inputs by the pilot flying generated a series of stall warnings, including activation of the stick pusher. The crew did not respond to the stall warnings in a timely and effective manner. 8. The loss of power from both engines was not detected and corrected by the crew in time to restart an engine. The aircraft stalled during the attempted restart at an altitude from which the aircraft could not recover from loss of control.  9. Flight crew coordination, communication, and threat and error management (TEM) were less than effective, and compromised the safety of the flight. Both operating crew members failed to obtain relevant data from each other regarding the status of both engines at different points in the occurrence sequence. The pilot flying did not appropriately respond to or integrate input from the pilot monitoring.METAR: 02:00 UTC / 10:00 local time: RCSS 040200Z 11007KT 9999 -DZ FEW013 BKN028 BKN040 16/14 Q1024 NOSIG RMK A302602:25 UTC / 10:25 local time: RCSS 040225Z 10008KT 9999 FEW013 BKN028 BKN040 16/13 Q1024 NOSIG RMK A302603:00 UTC / 11:00 local time: RCSS 040300Z 10010KT 9999 FEW015 BKN028 BKN040 16/13 Q1024 NOSIG RMK A3025Winds: 100 degrees at 10 knots; few clouds at 1500 feet; broken clouds at 2800 feet; broken clouds at 4000 feet; Temperature: 16Â°C; Dewpoint: 13Â°C; Pressure: 1024 mbAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: ASC Report number: ASC-AOR-16-06-001 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: ASC Taiwan  Location  Images: photo (c) M940504; near Taipei-Sung Shan Airport (TSA); 04 February 2015; (publicdomain) photo (c) Aviation Safety Council; near Taipei-Sung Shan Airport (TSA); 04 February 2015 photo (c) Aviation Safety Council; near Taipei-Sung Shan Airport (TSA); 04 February 2015 photo (c) Hyun Fumio; Taipei-Sung Shan Airport (TSA); 17 July 2014; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) Yi-Fan Wu; Taipei-Sung Shan Airport (TSA); 24 January 2015 photo (c) Yi-Fan Wu; Taipei-Sung Shan Airport (TSA); 27 September 2014 photo (c) Yi-Fan Wu; Taipei-Sung Shan Airport (TSA); 21 September 2014 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates02-Jan-2025 10:56 ASN Updated [Source, Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All four occupants sustained fatal injuries. The airplane had undergone routine maintenance in Miami and was returning to Venezuela at the time of the accident. An NTSB review of maintenance records revealed that the left engine propeller had been due for overhaul. It was removed and replaced with an overhauled propeller prior to the accident flight and the accident flight was the first flight after the overhauled propeller was installed on the left engine.  The flight was cleared for takeoff at 14:36:45 hours local time. At 14:38:15, one of the pilots reported an ""engine failure"" to air traffic control. The controller asked the pilot if he would like to return to the airport and the pilot replied affirmative. The controller then offered a 180-degree turn to runway 9R and the pilot requested a left traffic pattern to runway 27L, which the controller approved; however, the airplane subsequently impacted a utility pole and terrain about 4,5 km west of the runway. The highest altitude recorded on radar was 300 feet. A postcrash fire consumed a majority of the cockpit and cabin.  It appeared that the no.1 engine prop feathered after takeoff and that the engine was shut down prior to the accident. PROBABLE CAUSE: "" The left engine propeller's uncommanded travel to the feathered position during takeoff for reasons that could not be determined due to impact damage.

Of the 250 passengers and crew onboard, one flight attendant was seriously injured, and three flight attendants and one passenger sustained minor injuries. The airplane was not damaged. The flight was operating under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 as a regularly scheduled passenger flight from Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), Newark, New Jersey, to HNL. The flight was uneventful from EWR across the continental United States. Once over the Pacific Ocean, the flight received an ACARS message from dispatch advising of an area of possible embedded thunderstorms. The flight experienced light to moderate turbulence for most of the remaining flight, which required the seat belt sign to remain on most of the time. About an hour from HNL, the captain returned early from his crew rest time because he noticed that the flight was encountering areas of moderate turbulence. Prior to entering the flight deck, the captain noticed that the flight attendants (FA) were seated in their jumpseats and advised the lead FA to not conduct the final service and remain seated.Â Â Shortly after retaking the left seat, and as the flight was passing immediately south of a line of embedded of the forecasted thunderstorms, the captain requested a descent from their cruising altitude of flight level (FL)360 to FL240. The flight crew reported they were in instrument meteorological conditions with precipitation during the descent. The weather radar was on and the seatbelt sign was illuminated. The flight encountered an area of severe turbulence for about 30 seconds as it was descending through FL254. The flight data recorder data indicate that the vertical acceleration fluctuated between about -0.17 g's and  1.62 g's, the lateral acceleration fluctuated between about -0.09 g's and  0.11 g's, and the roll fluctuated between about 5Â° left and 12Â° right. At the time of the turbulence, the FAs were securing the galleys, preparing the cabin for landing, and distributing agriculture documents.Â Â Four flight attendants (FA) in the aft galley were thrown against the ceiling and back to the floor, injuring all four. After being notified of the serious injuries, the flight crew declared an emergency with air traffic control and arranged for medical personnel to meet the aircraft at HNL. The four flight attendants were transported to the hospital where one flight attendant was diagnosed with a fractured arm and the other three were released with minor injuries. After landing the crew were notified by a passenger that their child had suffered a bloody nose, who was treated but not transported to the hospital. Probable Cause: an encounter with convective turbulence associated with a forecasted area of thunderstorms.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA15LA067 Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA15LA067  https://flightaware.com/live/flight/UAL15/history/20150214/1410Z/KEWR/PHNL  http://www.khon2.com/news/local-news/nine-flights-to-and-from-the-islands-experience-weather-related-complications_20180309114038891/1025642249 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  17 December 2014 N59053 United Airlines 0 London Heathrow Airport (LHR/EGLL) non 6 March 2016 N59053 United Airlines 0 Houston-George Bush Intercontinental Airport, TX (IAH/KIAH) unk Bird strike Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates02-Jun-2023 13:19 ASN Update Bot Added 15-Jun-2023 20:52 Ron Averes Updated Corrections or additions? ...

The crew followed the emergency checklist and selected gear down and the indications changed to green, indicating that the landing gear was now down-and-locked. The crew elected to continue to Guernsey, Channel Islands with the undercarriage down. The aircraft performed an ILS approach and landed on runway 27. On touchdown, the aircraft pulled to the left and the co-pilot reported that there was no brake pressure. The commander suspected a tyre had burst and that hydraulic pressure had been lost. He therefore changed to the alternative braking system, slowed the aircraft and vacated the runway. The flight crew continued to taxi the aircraft and eight minutes passed before Guernsey ATC were informed that a tyre may have burst. Another aircraft landed on the runway during this period and before a runway inspection was initiated. Once G-RAJJ was parked, the crew discovered that the shock absorber on the left landing gear had separated and the tyre on the No 1 mainwheel had burst. Debris from the tyre and shock absorber was subsequently found on runway 27. The shock absorber separated either as a result of a hard landing, or incorrect gas pressures and oil level in the shock absorber. The physical damage to the shock absorber diaphragm threads and locking bolts started at least two flight cycles prior to the accident flight and may have occurred whilst it was fitted to another aircraft.

The flight crew elected to divert to St. Louis.  Although the activation of the fire suppression was a false alarm, the decision to divert was prudent and correct.  During the approach the crew made the decision to evacuate the airplane after landing, briefed the passengers in the courier area, and reviewed the evacuation checklist in the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH).  The diversion and subsequent landing were performed without issue.  After exiting the runway, and bringing the airplane to a stop in a safe area, the crew initiated an emergency evacuation using the left forward door (1L).  The door opened, however, the 1L escape slide/raft did not fully deploy, appearing to be hung up on a strap.  The first officer attempted to free it and the fire/rescue crew pulled on the slide and it appeared to inflate.  However, because the slide inflation sequence had been interrupted, it was significantly underinflated and unable to support the weight of the crewmember, resulting in a serious injury.  Post-incident examination of the 1L slide/raft was unable to determine the causes for the slide/raft to not inflate to full extension.

Marie Airport, ON (YAM) -   Canada","Landing","Passenger - Scheduled","Toronto-Pearson International Airport, ON (YYZ/CYYZ)","Sault Ste. Marie Airport, ON (YAM/CYAM)"," TSB","Accident investigation report completed and information captured","Air Canada Express flight 7795 was a scheduled domestic flight from Toronto/Lester B. Pearson International Airport, Canada, to Sault Ste. Marie Airport. On board the DHC-8-102 aircraft were 15 passengers, 2 flight crew members, and 1 cabin crew member. The captain performed the role of pilot flying (PF) and the first officer performed the role of pilot monitoring (PM). Just prior to descent from cruise altitude, the PF briefed the PM for the expected approach into Sault Ste. Marie. The PF was aware of the marginal weather conditions and included the possibility of a go-around and diversion in the briefing. As part of the briefing, the flight crew set the approach speed bugs to the appropriate speed for aircraft weight and flight conditions. The crew determined that the applicable landing reference speed (Vref) was 96 knots, which required an approach speed bug setting of 101 knots. When the aircraft was approximately 42 nautical miles (nm) from CYAM, the controller at the Toronto Area Control Centre cleared the flight to descend to 5000 feet above sea level (ASL) and, given the expected weather conditions, requested that the crew report when they had the airport in sight for the visual approach. As AC7795 reached 15 nm from Sault Ste. Marie in level flight at 5000 feet ASL, the crew reported that the in-flight visibility was reduced due to ice crystals. In consideration of this, they requested to be cleared for the VOR/DME approach to runway 30, rather than the visual approach, and were cleared as requested. While descending out of 3000 feet ASL, the flight crew passed through the area of ice crystals and acquired the airport visually. Although the flight was now in visual conditions, the crew noticed a significant snow shower approaching the arrival runway from the west. They reported these conditions to the controller, who cleared the flight for the visual approach, instructing them to deviate as necessary from the VOR approach. At 18:21:34 the aircraft passed over the final approach fix, 8.7 nm from the runway threshold, at a height of 2840 feet above ground level (AGL) and an indicated airspeed of 204 knots. The aircraft was descending on a 3Â° vertical path, although this was done visually, rather than with avionics-based vertical navigation guidance. The aircraft slowly decelerated from 204 to 181 knots while maintaining the 3Â° vertical path in descent from 2840 feet to 1500 feet. At 18:22:50, when AC7795 was 5 nm from Sault Ste. Marie, the flight crew contacted the Sault Ste. Marie control tower for landing clearance. The controller informed the crew that the wind was from 310Â° magnetic (M) at 22 knots with gusts to 29 knots, and mentioned the line of weather currently rolling across the runway. The controller further informed the crew that, due to this weather, the runway visual range (RVR) visibility had decreased to 1100 feet, with the runway lights set to level 4 intensity. The PM responded that they could see the approaching weather. At 18:23:05 and at 1500 feet, the power levers were moved toward flight idle and the engine torque reduced to between 3% and 4%. The aircraft began to decelerate more rapidly. The tower controller then informed AC7795 that the RVR had now reduced to 1000 feet, with the runway lights now at level 5 (full) intensity. Wind was reported as from 310Â°M at 25 knots, and JZA7795 was cleared to land. At 18:23:49, at 1000 feet and 2.8 nm from the runway threshold, the flaps were extended to 15Â° and the PF increased torque to 25%. The aircraft's airspeed was 148 knots. Between 1000 feet and 500 feet on approach, the aircraft generally maintained the 3Â° vertical path as the speed decreased from 148 to 122 knots. The engine torque varied during that time between 5% and 30% to account for configuration changes and wind gusts. At 500 feet, the airspeed was 122 knots, or 21 knots higher than the bugged approach speed of 101 knots. The aircraft was on the appropriate vertical path and torque was steady at 25%. The PF made the 8Â° left turn to align the aircraft with the runway heading. At 18:24:56, air traffic control (ATC) provided one last update to JZA7795, stating that the RVR was now 1200 feet. At 200 feet and at an airspeed of 124 knots, the PF began to reduce torque to idle and, as a result, the airspeed began to decrease rapidly. Although the aircraft's nose-up pitch was gradually increased and vertical speed was relatively stable, the vertical path steepened due to the decreasing airspeed and resultant ground speed reduction. The aircraft drifted below the 3Â° vertical path. This would normally be visually indicated by 4 red lights on the precision approach path indicator (PAPI), meaning the aircraft is too low. At some point below 200 feet, the flight crew lost visual reference to the ground due to the approaching weather system of blowing snow. The approach was continued. At 18:25:15, the terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS) issued a verbal alert to the pilots indicating that the aircraft's height was 50 feet. Then, at 20 feet, torque was increased toward 30%. At 18:25:19, the aircraft contacted the ground approximately 450 feet (137 meters) prior to the runway threshold at an airspeed of 94 knots. The ground preceding the runway was covered in approximately 8 to 12 inches of snow. The aircraft was in a level pitch attitude when it contacted the surface and touched down with a peak vertical acceleration of 2.32g. Following touchdown, the nose landing gear assembly and wheel struck and damaged an approach light located 300 feet prior to the runway threshold. The flight crew heard a thump, but had not seen the light and were unsure what had caused the noise. The aircraft came to a stop on the runway centreline, approximately 1500 feet past the threshold. The flight crew assessed the ground visibility as very poor, due to the blowing snow. Unsure of the aircraft's status, the flight crew informed the tower controller that the aircraft may have landed short of the runway and may have clipped the nosewheel. The crew asked the control tower to send a vehicle to their position to assess the situation, and requested that a bus be sent to move the passengers. When the emergency vehicles arrived and assessed the condition of the aircraft, no significant damage was noticed. Upon receiving this information, the flight crew elected to taxi the aircraft to the gate. The aircraft taxied to the gate without further incident, and the crew shut down the engines and deplaned the passengers. The crew did not believe there was damage to the aircraft and, therefore, did not pull the circuit breaker to prevent the cockpit voice recorder data from being overwritten. As a result, relevant data that would have been captured on the 30-minute cockpit voice recorder was overwritten while the aircraft remained electrically powered at the gate. After exiting the aircraft at the gate, the crew was notified of damage to an approach light and contacted maintenance to have the aircraft inspected. The aircraft sustained significant damage, mostly localized to the area near the nose landing gear, which had struck the approach light. The nose gear and nose gear doors were damaged and required replacement. Additionally, both main landing gear were determined to have exceeded load limits and required replacement. Findings as to causes and contributing factors: 1. The company standard operating procedures require an approach speed of Vref + 5 knots; however, this is being interpreted by flight crews as a target to which they should decelerate, from 120 knots, once the aircraft is below 500 feet. As a result, the majority of examined approaches, including the occurrence approach, were unstable, due to this deceleration. 2. Due to ambiguity in the guidance and uncertainty as to the required speeds during the approach, the crew did not recognize that the approach was unstable, and continued. 3. On the approach, the pilot flying reduced power to idle to reduce the approach speed from 122 knots toward 101 knots at 200 feet above ground level. This steepened the aircraft's vertical path. 4. The rapidly decreasing visibility resulted in the airport environment and the precision approach path indicator lights becoming obscured; as a result, the steepened vertical profile went unnoticed and uncorrected. 5. Although the loss of visual reference required a go-around, the crew continued the approach to land as a result of plan continuation bias. 6. The terrain awareness and warning system did not alert the crew to the aircraft's proximity to the ground once the aircraft was below 50 feet, possibly due to the rapid rate of closure. This lack of warning contributed to the crew not being aware of the aircraft's height above ground. 7. Due to the uncorrected steepened vertical profile, loss of visual reference, and lack of normal terrain warning, the aircraft contacted the surface approximately 450 feet prior to the runway threshold. Findings as to risk: 1. If guidance provided to flight crews allows for large tolerance windows, and crews are not trained to recognize an unstable condition, then there is a continued risk that flights that are unstable will be continued to a landing. 2. If approaches that require excessive deceleration below established stabilization heights are routinely flown, then there is a continued risk of an approach or landing accident. 3. If crews do not report unstable approaches and operators do not conduct flight data monitoring but rely only on safety management system reports to determine the frequency of unstable approaches, there is a risk that these issues will persist and contribute to an accident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A15O0015 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources: Flightaware  Sault Star 28-2-2015   Location  Images: photo (c) Google Earth; Sault Ste.

Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and an IFR flight plan was filed for the flight from Marathon-Florida Keys Airport (MTH), Florida. The airplane sustained substantial damage. The airline transport pilot and co-pilot, 1 flight attendant, and 4 passengers were not injured, 1 passenger sustained serious injuries, and 1 passenger sustained minor injuries. The flight originated from MTH about 15:54. The pilot-in-command (PIC) stated that the landing dry and wet distances were calculated to be 3,166 and 4,166 feet, respectively. The flight departed MTH and while en route they obtained the MKY automated weather observing station (AWOS) which indicated the wind was from 250 degrees at 5 knots, and the visibility was 10 miles. The PIC further stated they reviewed the speeds (Vref of 133 knots), and planned a visual approach to runway 17. Air traffic control approved their request for a visual approach, and they changed to the common traffic advisory frequency, entering left downwind for runway 17. They slowed, lowered the flaps to 20 degrees, and noted rain 2 to 3 miles east of MKY, though the airport appeared to be dry. When the flight was abeam runway 17, the landing gear was lowered and the flaps were extended to 30 degrees. The landing checklist was performed, and the anti-skid test was normal. The thrust reversers were armed, and he performed a ""teardrop turn"" to final. With flaps at 45 degrees, gear down, and flying Vref plus 10 knots, a couple of gusts were encountered during the approach. The co-pilot checked the AWOS again; the wind was still 250 degrees at 5 knots. He maintained a normal glide path at Vref plus 4 or 5 knots at the runway threshold, where he positioned both thrust levers to idle. The airplane was landed firm about 300 to 500 feet beyond the aiming point marking, and after touchdown he was unable to extend the ground spoilers. When the nose landing gear contacted the runway, he applied ""moderate"" brakes and held the control yoke forward, but felt no deceleration. He also attempted to deploy the thrust reversers but was unable. The PIC informed the co-pilot there was no braking energy and released the brakes; the anti-skid was turned off and the brakes were re-applied pressing hard. He did not feel any deceleration, and again tried to deploy the thrust reversers, but was unable. He kept the airplane on the runway centerline, and began modulating the brakes. Unable to stop the airplane he added right rudder input causing the airplane to veer to the right. The airplane went off the end of the runway into sand causing the nose landing gear to collapse. After coming to rest he ordered an emergency evacuation, and secured the engines. PROBABLE CAUSE: The failure of a spring inside the No. 2 brakeÂs upper brake control valve and the fracture of the coupling subassembly of the No. 1 wheel speed sensor during landing, which resulted in the loss of braking action, and the pilot-in-commandÂs (PIC) deactivation of the antiskid system even though there were no antiskid failure annunciations, which resulted in the rupture of the Nos. 1, 3, and 4 tires, further loss of braking action, and subsequent landing overrun. Contributing to accident were the PICÂs improper landing flare, which resulted in landing several hundred feet beyond the aiming point marking, and his unsuccessful attempts to deploy the thrust reversers for reasons that could not be determined because postaccident operational testing did not reveal any anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. Contributing to the passengerÂs injury was his leaving his seat intentionally while the airplane was in motion.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA15LA140 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Marco Island Airport, FL (MRK); March 2015; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Marco Island Airport, FL (MRK); March 2015; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Marco Island Airport, FL (MRK); March 2015; (publicdomain) photo (c) Mike Demulling; Marco Island Airport, FL (MRK); 08 December 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) Mike Demulling; Marco Island Airport, FL (MRK); 08 December 2017; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; March 2015; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Flight TK726 was a regular passenger service from Istanbul-AtatÃ¼rk International Airport (IST) to Kathmandu, Nepal. The flight was the first international flight to scheduled to arrive that morning. After descending from cruising altitude, it entered a holding pattern at FL210 at 06:12 hours local time (00:27 UTC) until about 07:00 (01:15 UTC) when it was cleared for a VOR/DME approach to runway 02. This approach was abandoned at about the Missed Approach Point at 1DME and the aircraft performed a go around. The aircraft circled and positioned for a second approach to runway 02. The aircraft touched down to the left of the runway centerline with the left hand main gear off the paved runway surface. It ran onto soft soil and the nose landing gear collapsed. The aircraft touched down at to the left of the centerline because the FMGS NAV database contained threshold coordinates for a proposed displacement of the runway 02 threshold. This was later withdrawn through a NOTAM, but had not been updated by the airline in the FMGS. Additionally, the coordinates that were initially published were inaccurate, causing the threshold coordinates to be offset to the left of the actual threshold. This had been noticed and reported by a previous Turkish Airlines flight on March 2. The changes to the FMGS had not been performed by the time TC-JOC landed at Kathmandu. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The decision of the flight crew to continue approach and landing below the minima with inadequate visual reference and not to perform a missed approach in accordance to the published approach procedure.

The 2 pilots, 3 flight attendants, and 98 of the 127 passengers were not injured; the other 29 passengers received minor injuries. The airplane was substantially damaged.  Flight 1086 was a regularly scheduled passenger flight from Atlanta-Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Georgia, where it departed at 09:23 hours local time.  Given the winter weather conditions at LaGuardia, the flight crew was concerned about the available landing distance on runway 13 (7003 ft / 2135 m). While en route to LGA they spent considerable time analyzing the airplaneÂs stopping performance. The flight crew also requested braking action reports about 45 and 35 minutes before landing, but none were available at those times because of runway snow clearing operations. The unavailability of braking actions reports and the uncertainty about the runwayÂs condition created some situational stress for the captain, who was the pilot flying. After runway 13 became available for arriving airplanes, the flight crews of two preceding airplanes (which landed on the runway about 16 and 8 minutes before the accident landing) reported good braking action on the runway, so the flight crew expected to see at least some of the runwayÂs surface after the airplane broke out of the clouds. However, the flight crew saw that the runway was covered with snow, which was inconsistent with their expectations based on the braking action reports and the snow clearing operations that had concluded less than 30 minutes before the airplane landed. The snowier-than-expected runway, along with the relatively short runway length and the presence of Flushing Bay directly off the departure end of the runway, most likely increased the captainÂs concerns about his ability to stop the airplane within the available runway distance, which exacerbated his situational stress.  The captain made a relatively aggressive reverse thrust input almost immediately after touchdown. Both pilots were aware that 1.3 EPR was the target setting for contaminated runways. As reverse thrust EPR was rapidly increasing, the captainÂs attention was focused on other aspects of the landing, which included steering the airplane to counteract a slide to the left and ensuring that the spoilers had deployed, which was a necessary action for the autobrakes to engage. The maximum EPR values reached during the landing were 2.07 on the left engine and 1.91 on the right engine, which were much higher than the target setting of 1.3 EPR. These high EPR values likely resulted from a combination of the captainÂs stress; his relatively aggressive reverse thrust input; and operational distractions, including the airplaneÂs continued slide to the left despite the captainÂs efforts to steer it away from the snowbanks alongside the runway. All of these factors reduced the captainÂs monitoring of EPR indications. The high EPR values caused rudder blanking, which occurs on MD-80 series airplanes when smooth airflow over the rudder is disrupted by high reverse thrust, and a subsequent loss of aerodynamic directional control. Although the captain stowed the thrust reversers and applied substantial right rudder, right nosewheel steering, and right manual braking, the airplaneÂs departure from the left side of the runway could not be avoided because directional control was regained too late to be effective. The airplane departed the left side of runway 13 about 3,000 feet from the approach end of the runway. The tracks were on a heading of about 10 degrees from the runway heading. About 4,100 feet from the approach end of the runway, the airplanes left wing initially struck the airportÂs perimeter fence, which is located on top of the berm, and the airplane tracks turn back parallel with runway 13. About 5,000 feet from the approach end of the runway, the airplane came to rest with its nose over the berm. The left wing of the airplane destroyed about 940 feet of the perimeter fence. PROBABLE CAUSE: The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the captainÂs inability to maintain directional control of the airplane due to his application of excessive reverse thrust, which degraded the effectiveness of the rudder in controlling the airplaneÂs heading. Contributing to the accident were the captainÂs (1) situational stress resulting from his concern about stopping performance and (2) attentional limitations due to the high workload during the landing, which prevented him from immediately recognizing the use of excessive reverse thrust.METAR: 15:24 UTC / 10:24 local time: KLGA 051524Z 04007KT 1/4SM R04/2600V2800FT SN FZFG VV009 M03/M04 A3013 RMK AO2 P000415:51 UTC / 10:51 local time: KLGA 051551Z 01008KT 1/4SM R04/2800V3500FT SN FZFG VV009 M03/M05 A3012 RMK AO2 SLP199 P0006 T1033105016:22 UTC / 11:22 local time: KLGA 051622Z 01008KT 1/4SM R04/3000VP6000FT SN FZFG VV011 M03/M05 A3012 RMK AO2 SFC VIS 1/2 P0003Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: NTSB/AAR-16/02 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB  Flightradar24  Liveatc.net   Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; New York-La Guardia Airport, NY (LGA); 05 March 2015; (publicdomain) photo (c) Sergio Cardona; New York-La Guardia Airport, NY (LGA); 05 March 2015 photo (c) NTSB; New York-La Guardia Airport, NY (LGA); March 2015; (publicdomain) photo (c) Leonard J.

The aircraft operated flight SG1085 from Bangalore to Hubli and departed at around 13:00 UTC. At the time the visibility reported for Hubli was 10 km.  When the aircraft came in contact with Mangalore ATC, the controller cleared the aircraft direct to Hubli and informed heavy rains and thunder showers over Hubli with visibility 3000 m. At around 60 nm from Hubli, the weather reported was heavy rain and visibility 4000 meters. ATC cleared aircraft for the NDB approach runway 26, however the captain preferred to carry out a VOR/DME trial procedure for runway 26. The descent was commenced and about 25 nm short of Hubli, ATC again advised visibility has reduced to 3000 m due heavy rain and thunderstorm. Thereafter the crew decided to hold over Hubli until the weather improves. Twenty minutes into holding, ATC again informed that visibility has improved to 4000 m in moderate rain. Subsequently descent was requested by the pilot for runway 26. The captain stated that he had established visual reference with runway at about 6 nm on the final approach course. The crew also selected wipers on short final to have a better visibility. The aircraft landed normally.  The captain stated that after touch down and reducing power, he was concentrating on the far end of the runway. As the runway was wet, he did not realize that the aircraft was drifting to the left of the center line. He further mentioned that he selected full reverse on both the engines to maintain the aircraft on the center line however the aircraft veered toward the left side of the runway and in the process overran the runway edge light, after which the left main landing gear collapsed. The propeller blades hit the runway surface and sheared off from the root attachment. The captain maneuvered the aircraft however the nose wheel tyre failed under over load conditions and the nose landing gear collapsed as well.  Subsequently, the aircraft exited the runway on the left side on kutcha (dried mud) and came to a final stop at round 52 meters away from the runway center line. The cockpit crew shut down the engines and the electrical power supply and cockpit door and announced evacuation. The cabin crew opened and the cabin doors on the right for evacuation.  There was no injury to any of the occupants on board the aircraft. There was no postaccident fire. Probable cause of the accident: Loss of visual cues after touch down in inclemental weather conditions resulted in veering of the aircraft towards left of the centerline leading to runway excursion and accident. Following are the contributory factors. 1. Inappropriate handling technique of the aircraft controls by the PIC to maintain the directional control of the aircraft after landing. 2. Non-standards callouts by the first officer to correct situation after landing. 3. Impact of the landing gear with the non-frangible erected runway edge light resulted in retraction of the same. 4. At the time of the accident DGCA O.M. No. AV.15026/006/92- AS dated 3rd February 1992 was in force, which dictated examiners and instructors of the operators only to carry out trial procedures in VMC and during Daytime only.

The pilot, the sole occupant on board, was not injured, and the airplane sustained substantial damage.  Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident, and an instrument flight rules flight plan had been filed. The flight originated from Lansing-Capital City Airport (LAN), Michigan and was destined for Muskegon County Airport. According to the pilot he flew the approach to minimums, saw the approach lights and saw he was right of the runway. As he maneuvered to realign the airplane with the runway, he struck the approach lights. After landing, he examined the airplane and found the left horizontal stabilizer hanging down. There were numerous dents on the leading edge of the left wing strut, and the left landing gear was bent. Effective at the time of this accident was a permanent Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) associated with the ILS runway 24 approach prohibiting a coupled autopilot approach from 1150 feet mean seal level to the surface. During a post-accident interview the pilot stated he was unaware of this NOTAM. The NOTAM had been in effect since February 21st, 2014 and the approach chart used did not note this approach restriction.

The co-pilot performed the external checks; this included checking the fluid level in the hydraulic reservoir. The aircraft was refuelled to 3,000 lb and, after the passengers boarded, it departed for Blackpool. The commander was the pilot flying (PF). The takeoff and cruise to Blackpool were uneventful.  The commander planned and briefed for the NDB approach to runway 10, which was to be flown with the autopilot engaged. Whilst descending through FL120, the left, followed by the right, hydraulic low pressure cautions illuminated. Upon checking the hydraulic pressure gauge, the pressure was noted to be Âcycling up and downÂ, but for the majority of the time it indicated about 2,800 psi (in the green arc). During this time the hydraulic low pressure cautions went on and off irregularly, with the left caution being on more often than the right. The co-pilot then actioned the ÂHYDRAULIC SYSTEM - HYDRAULIC PUMP FAILUREÂ checklist. It stated that if the hydraulic pressure was a minimum of 2,800 psi, the flight could be continued. Just before the aircraft reached the Blackpool NDB, the commander commented ""itÂs dropping"", but he could not recall what he was referring to. This was followed by the roll fail and speed brk [brake] fail caution messages illuminating. The co-pilot then actioned the applicable checklists. These stated that the Landing Distances Required (LDR) would increase by approximately 65% and 21%, respectively. As the roll fail LDR increase was greater than that of the speed brk fail, the crew used an LDR increase of 65% which the co-pilot equated to 5,950 ft. Runway 10 at Blackpool has an LDA of 6,131 ft, therefore they elected to continue to Blackpool. The roll fail checklist stated that a ÂFLAPS UPÂ landing was required. The co-pilot then calculated the VREF of 132 kt, including a 20 kt increment, as stipulated by the ÂFLAPS UP, 10, OR 20 APPROACH AND LANDINGÂ checklist. The commander then continued with the approach. At about 4 nm on final approach the co-pilot lowered the landing gear, in response to the commanderÂs request. About 8 seconds later the commander said ""just lost it all""; referring to the general state of the aircraft. This was followed almost immediately by the landing gear unsafe aural warning, as the main landing gear was not indicating down and locked. Whilst descending through 1,000 ft, at just over 3 nm from the threshold, the commander asked the co-pilot to action the ÂALTERNATE GEAR EXTENSIONÂ checklist. The commander then discontinued the approach by selecting ALT HOLD, increased engine thrust and selected a 500 ft/min rate of climb on the autopilot. However, a few seconds later, before the co-pilot could action the checklist, the main gear indicated down and locked. The commander disconnected the autopilot and continued the approach. The crew did not consider reviewing the ÂHYDRAULIC SYSTEM - HYDRAULIC PUMP FAILUREÂ checklist as they had not recognised the symptoms of loss of hydraulic pressure. When ATC issued the aircraft its landing clearance the wind was from 140Â° at 17 kt. This equated to a headwind component of about 10 kt and a crosswind of about 12 kt. As the aircraft descended through 500 ft (the Minimum Descent Altitude (MDA) for the approach) at 1.5 nm from the threshold, the commander instructed the co-pilot to advise ATC that they had a hydraulic problem and to request the RFFS to be put on standby. There was a slight delay in transmitting this request, due to another aircraft on frequency, but the request was acknowledged by ATC. The aircraft touched down about 1,500 ft from the start of the paved surface at an airspeed of 132 kt and a groundspeed of 124 kt. When the commander applied the toe (power) brakes he felt no significant retardation. During the landing roll no attempt was made to apply the emergency brakes, as required in the event of a power brake failure. The co-pilot asked if he should try to operate the lift dump, but it failed to function, due to the lack of hydraulic pressure. At some point, while the aircraft was on the runway, the co-pilot transmitted a MAYDAY call to ATC. When an overrun appeared likely, the commander shut down the engines. The aircraft subsequently overran the end of the runway at a groundspeed of about 80 kt. The commander later commented that he was in a ""state of panic"" during the landing roll and was unsure whether or not he had applied the emergency brake. As the aircraft left the paved surface the commander steered the aircraft slightly right to avoid a shallow downslope to the left of runwayÂs extended centreline. The aircraft continued across the rough, uneven ground, during which the nose gear collapsed and the wing to fuselage attachments were severely damaged. Once it had come to a stop, he shut down the remaining aircraft systems. The passengers and crew, who were uninjured, vacated the aircraft via the entry/exit door and moved upwind to a safe distance. The investigation determined that, irrespective of the omission to apply the emergency brakes, the Landing Distance Available (LDA) at Blackpool was insufficient for the aircraft to land with a hydraulic failure.  A fatigue crack in the port cap1 of the left hydraulic pump had caused a hydraulic leak which eventually resulted in the total loss of the hydraulic system.METAR: 11:50 UTC / 11:50 local time: EGNH 121150Z 15021KT 9000 FEW024 11/08 Q102012:20 UTC / 12:20 local time: EGNH 121220Z 14018KT 9000 FEW024 12/08 Q1020Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: EW/C2015/03/01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB   Location  Images: photo (c) Steve; Blackpool Airport (BLK); 13 March 2015 photo (c) AAIB; Blackpool Airport (BLK); March 2015 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Purpose of the flight was to carry out flight inspections to confirm the required performance of aeronautical navigation facilities. The captain was Pilot Flying. While the aircraft was flying south-southwest on Airway V31 toward the Niigata VORTAC at an altitude 9,000 ft, the captain and the first officer sighted a lower layer of clouds but had visually confirmed that there was no cloud on the flight route in the vicinity of Niigata Airport. At about 14:32, the aircraft commenced a descending turn from right above Niigata Airport in order to inspect on the next airway. At this time, the captain and the first officer had checked on an indication on the weather radar display of the aircraft showing a precipitation area, albeit not on their route, and were therefore focusing attention in that direction. They then encountered scattered thin clouds, but this was judged not to be thick clouds which might lead to turbulence or thunder. At about 14:35, as the aircraft entered the thin cloud at an altitude about 6,500 ft, a very loud noise was heard on the radio equipment while the captain, the first officer and the onboard maintenance engineer were listening to it. After three to four seconds, the captain and the first officer received an impact accompanied by a loud popping noise, together with a strong flash from the front of the aircraft. While continuing the flight, the captain and the first officer checked the instruments to check whether abnormality had occurred to the aircraft; consequently, they confirmed that discoloration was found on some of the cockpit instrument displays, and that the airborne DME (Distance Measuring Equipment) display on the captain's side had disappeared. However, there was no abnormality in the DME display on the first officer's side and there was no problem with the visibility of the discolored instrument displays; accordingly, they judged there to be no serious abnormality which would affect the flight. The captain, the first officer and the onboard maintenance engineer discussed whether they should continue the flight inspection, and although there was thought to be no hindrance to the flight, they decided to suspend the flight and return to the base of the aircraft at Tokyo International Airport, because they could not confirm damage to the airframe while on board. Thereafter the aircraft landed at Tokyo International Airport at 15:26. On the post-flight inspection, damage was confirmed to the left front fuselage outer skins, the front lower fuselage and the left horizontal stabilizer. PROBABLE CAUSES: ""It is probable that this accident occurred because the aircraft sustained damage to the outer skins of its left front lower fuselage as a result of being struck by lightning to the airframe in flight. It is probable that the lightning strike was occurred because the aircraft came close to the electrically charged cumulus clouds in the scattered thin cloud where it was difficult to predict lightning.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JTSB Report number: AA2016-9 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 8 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) JTSB; Tokyo-Haneda Airport (HND/RJTT); March 2015 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight was a regular passenger service from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to Melbourne. The flight crew consisted of a captain, who was the pilot flying (PF) and a first officer, who was pilot monitoring (PM). The approach to runway 34 at Melbourne airport was not equipped with an Instrument Landing System (ILS), so a non-precision approach was performed, aided by PAPI lights.  Flight data showed that the PF disengaged the autopilot at approximately 700 feet above ground level (AGL) and from that point until touchdown there was an increase in the frequency and magnitude of sidestick pitch control inputs by the PF. In response to these inputs the aircraftÂs autothrottle system varied the engine thrust to maintain a target speed, as per system design, and the aircraft pitch angles fluctuated between approximately -0.5Â° nose down and +5.0Â° nose up. The net result of the varying thrust settings and pitch angles was a fluctuating rate of descent between approximately 380 and 960 feet per minute. Large sidestick inputs, specifically nose-down, also have the potential to inhibit the vertical speed reduction function, which is an automated function that provides some protection against touchdown at very high vertical speeds. As the aircraft passed 300 feet a rate of descent of 960 feet per minute was recorded. This neared the operatorÂs maximum stabilised approach limit of 1000 feet per minute when below 500 feet AGL. As well as a high rate of descent, actual exceedances of the operatorÂs stabilisation criteria included: large changes to pitch inputted by the pilot flying, including negative pitch values, fluctuations in the rate of descent over a large range that were abnormal for the phase of flight, incorrect glide path.  From approximately 250 feet AGL, the aircraft was trending low and continuing below the glide path. At this point the pilots would have been able to observe 3 red lights and one white light on the PAPI. This trend was allowed to continue until the aircraft was well below the desired glide path to the extent that the PAPI would have indicated 4 red lights from approximately 125 feet AGL. From this point the PF made numerous pitch commands which were mostly nose down. These included a full range nose down deflection at 24 feet AGL. The company procedures and manufacturerÂs recommendations dictated that if an approach becomes unstable below 500 feet AGL, a go-around must be initiated by the pilot flying (PF) and/or the pilot monitoring (PM) must alert the PF of the unstable approach and encourage a go-around. At 60 feet AGL the captain moved the thrust levers forward momentarily into the TOGA (Take-off/Go Around) detent. The captain stated that this was done in response to a feeling that the aircraft was sinking below the path, and the intention was to reduce this sink by applying more thrust to the engines. The placement of the thrust lever into TOGA placed the aircraft automation into the go-around autopilot modes and changed the display on the primary flight display flight mode annunciator (FMA). The captain subsequently reduced the thrust levers. The PM, on seeing the modes on the FMA change assumed that a go-around was being conducted and awaited further announcement from the captain. The PM reported noticing the thrust levers reducing and that the aircraft was not flaring and applied nose up input to the sidestick at the same time as the PF. At the time of the occurrence there was no procedure on the A330 for the use of manual thrust for this purpose. Prior to 2009, a procedure existed in the Airbus A330 documentation that allowed a specific use of manual thrust in difficult environmental conditions. Airbus advised that after an analysis of in-service events the procedure was removed from all operational documents.  Manipulation of the thrust levers in this manner had the effect of disengaging the autothrottle thereby inhibiting some of the available auto flight system protections including the target speed function (which automatically maintained the desired speed and adjusted for fluctuation in the wind), and the vertical speed reduction function. It also caused a pitch up tendency which usually requires a large nose down input by the pilot flying to prevent the aircraft from pitching up. At this stage in the approach applying large nose down inputs differed from the gradual nose up input normally required to complete the flare. Furthermore, it resulted in breaking down of the shared mental model between the pilot flying and pilot monitoring in that the pilot monitoring believed the advancement of the thrust levers was the initiation of a go-around. Shortly after this action, the aircraft touched down at a vertical speed of approximately 700 feet per minute and a vertical acceleration of 2.61 G was recorded. The aircraft also touched down at approximately 170m (560 feet) from the landing threshold, short of the normal touchdown zone of between 304m (1000 feet) and 609m (2000 feet). The manufacturer of the aircraft produced a complete load analysis of the event based on recorded flight data provided by the operator. The conclusion of this analysis was that several components in the left and right gear had ""exceeded their design load limits and may have been detrimentally overloaded"". There were no injuries reported as a result of the hard landing. The airplane remained at Melbourne until March 26, when it was ferried at low altitude to Darwin, Australia, and continuing to Kuala Lumpur the next day for further repairs. Contributing factors: - The final approach became unstable at around 300 feet above the ground due to the control inputs from the captain. - Inadequate monitoring and communication by the crew led to a lack of recognition of the undesirable flight state and the continuation of an unstable approach. - Continuation of the unstable approach led to a high rate of descent at touchdown and resulted in a hard landing in excess of the aircraft design loads and short of the normal touchdown area. Other safety factors: The captain used an unapproved manual thrust procedure in an attempt to recover the approachMETAR: 20:30 UTC / 07:30 local time: YMML 132030Z 36012KT CAVOK 11/07 Q1016 NOSIG21:00 UTC / 08:00 local time: YMML 132100Z 36015KT CAVOK 12/07 Q1016 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: ATSB Report number: AO-2015-032 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years Download report:  Final report Sources: ATSB   Location  Images: photo (c) Flightaware.com; Melbourne-Tullamarine Airport, VIC (MEL); 14 March 2015 photo (c) ATSB; Melbourne-Tullamarine Airport, VIC (MEL); 14 March 2015; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The force landing was a result of a loss of engine power during an en route climb. The pilot received minor injuries and the passenger was not injured. The airplane was substantially damaged. The aircraft was owned and operated by the pilot as post maintenance test flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight. The flight originated from the Tulsa International Airport, Oklahoma, at 15:00. The airplane was equipped with a Honeywell TPE331 engine which had been installed about 9 flight hours prior to the accident. The pilot stated they were climbing to 11,000 feet when he noticed a decrease in engine torque with a steady exhaust gas temperature (EGT). As the torque started to drop even more, the EGT also began to decrease. The pilot attempted to fly to a nearby airstrip, but was unable to maintain sufficient altitude. He then chose a field in which to land. Shortly after touching down, the airplane contacted trees, completely severing the left wing from the fuselage and partially severing the right wing from the fuselage. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The fuel pump gear manufacturerÂs allowance of set-up gears made from a nonconforming material to be put in the production inventory system, the installation of a nonconforming gear in the accident airplaneÂs production fuel pump, and the gearÂs failure, which resulted in a loss of fuel flow to the engine and the subsequent loss of engine power.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN15LA180 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NewsOn6  NTSB   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All 144 passengers and six crew members were killed. Flight 4U9525 departed Barcelona, Spain at 10:00 hours local time (09:00 UTC) on a regular passenger service to DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany. The flight reached its cruising altitude of FL380 at 10:27 hours. At 10:30 hours the flight was cleared direct to the IRMAR waypoint, which was confirmed by the flight: ""Direct IRMAR, Merci 18G."" This was the last radio contact with the flight. At 10:30:08, the captain told the co-pilot that he was leaving the cockpit and asked him to take over radio communications, which the co-pilot acknowledged. At 10:30:53, the selected altitude on the Flight Control Unit (FCU) changed in from 38,000 ft to 100 ft. One second later, the autopilot changed to OPEN DES mode and autothrust changed to THR IDLE mode. The airplane started to descend and both engines' speed decreased. At 10:33:12, the speed management changed from managed mode to selected mode. One second later, the selected target speed became 308 kt while the aeroplane's speed was 273 kt. The aeroplane's speed started to increase along with the descent rate, which subsequently varied between 1,700 ft/min and 5,000 ft/min, then was on average about 3,500 ft/min. The selected speed decreased to 288 kt. Then, over the following 13 seconds, the value of this target speed changed six times until it reached 302 kt.  At 10:33:47, the controller asked the flight crew what cruise level they were cleared for. The airplane was then at an altitude of 30,000 ft in descent. There was no answer from the co-pilot. Over the following 30 seconds, the controller tried to contact the flight crew again on two occasions, without any answer. Thereafter the selected speed increased up to 323 kt. Then the buzzer to request access to the cockpit sounded, but the copilot did not react. Marseille control centre kept attempting to contact the flight, without any response. The selected speed was again increased, this time to 350 kt. Meanwhile the captain attempted to call the copilot over the interphone and there were noises similar to a person knocking on the cockpit door. At the same time Marseille control and a controller from the French Air Defence system called the flight at various frequencies, without success. As the aircraft kept descending noises similar to violent blows on the cockpit door were recorded on five occasions between 10:39:30 and 10:40:28. The GPWS then sounded: ""Terrain, Terrain, Pull Up, Pull Up"" until the aircraft impacted a sloping rocky ravine in mountainous terrain at an elevation of 1550 meters. Causes: The collision with the ground was due to the deliberate and planned action of the co-pilot who decided to commit suicide while alone in the cockpit. The process for medical certification of pilots, in particular self-reporting in case of decrease in medical fitness between two periodic medical evaluations, did not succeed in preventing the co-pilot, who was experiencing mental disorder with psychotic symptoms, from exercising the privilege of his licence. The following factors may have contributed to the failure of this principle: - the co-pilot's probable fear of losing his ability to fly as a professional pilot if he had reported his decrease in medical fitness to an AME; - the potential financial consequences generated by the lack of specific insurance covering the risks of loss of income in case of unfitness to fly; - the lack of clear guidelines in German regulations on when a threat to public safety outweighs the requirements of medical confidentiality. Security requirements led to cockpit doors designed to resist forcible intrusion by unauthorized persons. This made it impossible to enter the flight compartment before the aircraft impacted the terrain in the French Alps.METAR: 08:30 UTC / 09:30 local time: LEBL 240830Z 05012KT 9000 -RA FEW020 SCT027 BKN045 12/10 Q1006 NOSIG09:00 UTC / 10:00 local time: LEBL 240900Z 05016KT 9999 FEW020 BKN045 12/10 Q1006 RERA NOSIGBarcelona Airport weather during takeoff: Wind 050 degrees at 16 knots; 10+ km visibility; few clouds at 2000 feet; broken clouds at 4500 feet; 12Â°C; dew point 10Â°C; Recent moderate/heavy rain09:30 UTC / 10:30 local time: LFML 240930Z 24006KT CAVOK 15/09 Q1008 NOSIGMarseille Airport weather: wind 240 degrees at 6 knots; 15Â°C, dew point 9Â°; CAVOK09:30 UTC / 10:30 local time: LEBL 240930Z 05015KT 8000 -RA FEW020 BKN045 13/11 Q1006 NOSIG10:00 UTC / 11:00 local time: LFML 241000Z 27005KT 9999 FEW033 BKN210 16/08 Q1008 NOSIGAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: BEA Report number: BEA2015-0125 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: List of aircraft accidents and incidents intentionally caused by pilots  Flightradar24  Task Force on Measures Following the Accident of Germanwings Flight 9525 / EASA, 17 July 2015  SKYbraryÂ    Location  Images: photo (c) Bureau d`EnquÃªtes et d`Analyses (BEA, France, www.bea.aero); near Barcelonette; 25 March 2015 photo (c) Flightradar24/Aviation Safety Network; near Barcelonette; 24 March 2015 photo (c) Bureau d`EnquÃªtes et d`Analyses (BEA, France, www.bea.aero); near Barcelonette photo (c) Bureau d`EnquÃªtes et d`Analyses (BEA, France, www.bea.aero); near Barcelonette photo (c) Bureau d`EnquÃªtes et d`Analyses (BEA, France, www.bea.aero); near Barcelonette; 25 March 2015 photo (c) Bureau d`EnquÃªtes et d`Analyses (BEA, France, www.bea.aero); near Barcelonette; 25 March 2015 photo (c) Bureau d`EnquÃªtes et d`Analyses (BEA, France, www.bea.aero); April 2015 photo (c) Bureau d`EnquÃªtes et d`Analyses (BEA, France, www.bea.aero); April 2015 photo (c) Bureau d`EnquÃªtes et d`Analyses (BEA, France, www.bea.aero); April 2015 photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Palma de Mallorca Airport (PMI/LEPA); 13 October 2014 photo (c) Jan MÃ¼nster; Hamburg-FuhlsbÃ¼ttel Airport (HAM/EDDH); 10 March 2015 photo (c) Timo Blossfeld; Berlin-Tegel Airport (TXL/EDDT); 29 March 2014 photo (c) Miklos SZABO; Wien-Schwechat International Airport (VIE/LOWW); 23 August 2013 photo (c) Gerhard Plomitzer; MÃ¼nchen-Franz Josef Strauss Airport (MUC/EDDM); 08 October 2010 photo (c) Stanley Page; London-Heathrow Airport (LHR/EGLL); 21 February 2015 photo (c) Giorgio Parolini; Milano-Malpensa Airport (MXP/LIMC); 02 September 2014 photo (c) RenÃ© Verschuur; BarcelonaâEl Prat Airport (BCN/LEBL); 09 August 2014 photo (c) Markus Schauhuber; Wien-Schwechat International Airport (VIE/LOWW); 20 March 2015 photo (c) Markus Schauhuber; Wien-Schwechat International Airport (VIE/LOWW); 20 March 2015 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates08-Jan-2025 19:05 ASN Updated [Departure airport, Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The airplane sustained substantial damage. 23 occupants were injured. Flight 624 departed from Toronto at 21:05 hours local time (01:05 UTC). At 23:40 hours local time (02:40 UTC) the aircraft entered a holding pattern to the west of Halifax. Visibility was limited due to snowfall.  The aircraft was then cleared for a Localizer (LOC-Z) approach to runway 05 at Halifax Airport. During final approach the aircraft severed powerlines located 250 m from the beginning of the paved surface of runway 05. The aircraft then impacted a localizer antenna array, located 70 m further on, and became airborne again. The Airbus slid onto the runway and came to rest near taxiway B. The nose cone was ripped off in the accident sequence and pieces of the antenna array were embedded in the nose of plane. Part of the undercarriage were sheared off and both engines separated. There was extensive damage to both wing leading edges and horizontal stabilizers and lower fuselage. The last flight landing at Halifax before the accident was AC118, an Embraer 190 from Ottawa, at 21:50 hours local time. Two other incoming flights diverted and two were cancelled. Findings as to causes and contributing factors: 1. Air Canada's standard operating procedure (SOP) and practice when flying in flight path angle guidance mode was that, once the aircraft was past the final approach fix, the flight crews were not required to monitor the aircraft's altitude and distance from the threshold or to make any adjustments to the flight path angle. This practice was not in accordance with the flight crew operating manuals of Air Canada or Airbus. 2. As per Air Canada's practice, once the flight path angle was selected and the aircraft began to descend, the flight crew did not monitor the altitude and distance from the threshold, nor did they make any adjustments to the flight path angle. 3. The flight crew did not notice that the aircraft had drifted below and diverged from the planned vertical descent angle flight profile, nor were they aware that the aircraft had crossed the minimum descent altitude further back from the threshold. 4. Considering the challenging conditions to acquire and maintain the visual cues, it is likely the flight crew delayed disconnecting the autopilot until beyond the minimum descent altitude because of their reliance on the autopilot system. 5. The approach and runway lights were not changed from setting 4 to setting 5; therefore, these lights were not at their maximum brightness setting during the approach. 6. The system to control the airfield lighting's preset selections for brightness setting 4 was not in accordance with the NAV CANADA Air Traffic Control Manual of Operations requirement for the omnidirectional approach lighting system to be at its brightest settings. 7. The limited number of visual cues and the short time that they were available to the flight crew, combined with potential visual illusions and the reduced brightness of the approach and runway lights, diminished the flight crew's ability to detect that the aircraft's approach path was taking it short of the runway. 8. The flight crew's recognition that the aircraft was too low during the approach would have been delayed because of plan continuation bias. 9. The aircraft struck terrain approximately 740 feet short of the runway threshold, bounced twice, and then slid along the runway before coming to a rest approximately 1900 feet beyond the runway threshold. 10. At some time during the impact sequence, the captain's head struck the glare shield because there were insufficient acceleration forces to lock the shoulder harness and prevent movement of his upper body. 11. The first officer sustained a head injury and serious injury to the right eye as a result of striking the glare shield because the automatic locking feature of the right-side shoulder-harness inertia reel was unserviceable. 12. A flight attendant was injured by a coffee brewer that came free of its mounting base because its locking system was not correctly engaged. 13. Because no emergency was expected, the passengers and cabin crew were not in a brace position at the time of the initial impact. 14.

The accident is classified as a technical failure of the No. 4 wheel tire, a result of the aging process of the tire that resulted in the weakening of the ""insole reinforcement layer"" and the separation of the insole from the reinforcement layer, during the take-off run. The failure of wheel tire No. 4 started at a relatively high speed of a heavy plane and it created a chain process of load on the other wheels and high heat. Wheels 3 and 4 failed respectively (the fuses melted), due to the increase in temperature inside the tire and the air was released to prevent the tire from exploding.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIAI Report number: 33-15 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilots were not injured. The airplane was operated by a private company. Day, visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and an instrument flight rules flight plan was filed. The flight originated at Caracas-SimÃ³n BolÃ­var International Airport, Venezuela about 16:30. The pilot reported that the purpose of the flight was to fly the airplane to FXE for scheduled maintenance. About 2 hours and 15 minutes after departure, at flight level 430, the crew observed a red warning light indicating a maximum cabin differential pressure of 9.8 psi, followed by a red ""DOOR MAIN"" indication. The pilots donned oxygen masks and referenced the airplane's quick reference handbook. A loud ""bam"" sound was then heard in the cabin and the crew initiated an immediate descent. The cabin pressure outflow valve was opened manually and the airplane was leveled at 12,000 feet above mean sea level. The flight continued to FXE unpressurized and landed without further incident. After landing, the crew performed a walk-around inspection and found no obvious anomalies with the airplane. A subsequent inspection of the airplane by maintenance and engineering personnel revealed structural airframe damage, including a cracked floor beam, dimpled areas in the floor boards, damaged structure between ribs, and damaged wing links. An initial examination of the fuselage revealed that the outflow valve safety port, located on the outer fuselage, was completely plugged with a foreign material resembling dried dirt from a mud dauber. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The in-flight failure of the cabin pressurization relief/safety valve (CPRV) due to an obstruction of the CPRV static port, which allowed the airplane to overpressurize.

On the morning of the occurrence, CA66's first officer arrived at the airport at approximately 06:00. The first officer appeared to be in good spirits and spent about 5 minutes in the flight planning room before going to the aircraft to prepare it for that day's flights. The captain arrived at approximately 06:15 and went directly to the flight planning room to begin preparing the morning's flight plan. He appeared to be in a positive state of mind and spent a few minutes speaking with other company pilots who were also preparing to operate flights. He used a company computer to access weather information and placed a telephone call to NAV CANADA to file an instrument flight rules flight plan. No abnormal behaviour was observed by anyone with whom he had contact. The captain then walked to the aircraft and spent about 10 minutes in the flight deck before assisting the first officer with loading the flight's cargo. Final flight preparations were carried out by both flight crew members before they boarded the aircraft and started the engines, at about 06:45. At 07:03, CA66 began its take-off run. The aircraft lifted off after an approximate ground-run distance of 2800 to 3000 feet. This was within the expected normal performance for the aircraft type. Shortly after takeoff, CA66 contacted CYVR terminal departure control and was cleared to 9000 feet above sea level (ASL). A short time later, the air traffic controller assigned the flight a northbound heading. At 07:07, CYVR terminal departure control instructed CA66 to change radio frequencies and contact CYVR centre control. Upon initial contact with CYVR centre control, while climbing through 7500 feet, CA66 was again cleared to the aircraft's final flight planned altitude of flight level 200. At 07:08, the crew acknowledged a clearance to climb to flight level 200; this was CA66's last radio transmission. One minute and 20 seconds later, while climbing through an altitude of 8700 feet on an assigned heading of 350Â° magnetic, the aircraft disappeared from secondary surveillance radar displays at air traffic control. CA66's radar track, from the time it first became visible on radar at 07:02 until a steep descent toward ground, was approximately 7 minutes. The track showed an apparently routine climb from CYVR, at an average climb rate of 1500 feet per minute. Aircraft speed during the climb increased gradually until a ground speed of approximately 185 knots was reached. The last 3 radar returns from CA66 showed the aircraft beginning an abrupt, steep descent. At 07:09, a radar return showed that the aircraft was at 8700 feet; this was the highest altitude it reached. The 2 subsequent radar returns showed that the aircraft had dropped rapidly to 7600 feet and then 5000 feet while continuing in the direction of flight. There were no further returns. During the initial stage of the descent, the aircraft pitched down at about 6Â° per second, and its vertical acceleration reached -0.6g. The descent to 5000 feet likely occurred within 10 to 14 seconds. During that period, the aircraft's descent rate exceeded 30 000 feet per minute, and aerodynamic forces caused structural disintegration of the aircraft (in-flight breakup). There was no Mayday call or other communication from the aircraft during this period. Deteriorating weather conditions with low cloud and heavy snowfall hampered an air search; however, aircraft wreckage was found on steep, mountainous, snow-covered terrain by ground searchers at approximately 16:45. Both pilots had been fatally injured. Investigation showed that the captain had 0.24% blood alcohol content [BAC]. To obtain this, the captain would have had to consume approximately 17 to 20 standard drinks over a 12-hour period.  An autopsy also identified focal severe coronary artery atherosclerosis and both steatosis and hepatitis in the captainÂs liver. Finding these conditions in a 34-year-old person suggests excessive alcohol consumption over a significant period. The captain had recently applied for the position of Vancouver base chief pilot for the companyÂs cargo operation. On 26 March 2015, the company advised him that the position had been awarded to another candidate. Around the same period, on 24 March 2015, 20 days before this accident, a first officer who had been having symptoms of depression and psychosis deliberately flew a Germanwings Airbus A320 into terrain, killing all on board. Although there were several coincidental factors, the investigation could not make any conclusions about the captainÂs predisposition to committing an intentional act. Other scenario's like pitot system blockage or crew incapacitation were also considered, but deemed not very probable. Findings as to causes and contributing factors: 1. For unknown reasons, the aircraft descended in the direction of flight at high speed until it exceeded its structural limits, leading to an in-flight breakup. 2. Based on the captain's blood alcohol content, alcohol intoxication almost certainly played a role in the events leading up to the accident.METAR: 13:46 UTC / 06:46 local time: SPECI CYVR 131346Z 09008KT 15SM -RA FEW033 SCT056 OVC069 07/04 A2989 RMK SC2SC2AC4 SLP12314:00 UTC / 07:00 local time: CYVR 131400Z 15004KT 090V190 15SM -RA FEW033 SCT042 BKN054 OVC069 07/04 A2990 RMK SC2SC2SC3AC1 SLP124Wind 150 degrees at 4 knots, carying 90-190 degrees; visibility: 15 miles; rain; Few clouds at 3300 feet; Scattered clouds at 4200 feet; Broken clouds at 5400 feet; Overcast at 6900 feet; Temp. 7Â°C; Dew point 4Â°CAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A15P0081 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Flightaware History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  19 May 2000 N235BA Superior Aviation 0 Denver International Airport, CO (DEN) sub 20 February 2006 N235BA Superior Aviation 0 Casper, WY min Location  Images: photo (c) TSB; near Vancouver, BC; 14 April 2015 photo (c) TSB; near Vancouver, BC; 14 April 2015 photo (c) TSB; Vancouver, BC; 23 April 2015 photo (c) TSB; near Vancouver, BC; 13 April 2015 photo (c) TSB; near Vancouver, BC; 13 April 2015 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight was cleared for a runway 28 RNAV (GNSS) approach. During the approach a local transient fog layer moved over the airport. The Runway Visual Range in the touchdown zone decreased rapidly as low as 350 m. After that, the value recovered and returned to the value of more than 1,800 m. After the pilot in command and the first officer talked that the appearance of the runway was slightly odd, Hiroshima Tower reported a Touchdown RVR of 1,700 m. After that the captain disengaged the autopilot. At that time the aircraft was flying at 1000 feet above airfield elevation.  The aircraft then descended below the normal 3Â° glide path. At decision altitude, the captain called, ""Continue,"" and continued descending. Immediately after this, the first officer concernedly said, ""Runway was not in sight."" At this stage, the approach path was getting even lower but still remained uncorrected.  The captain said, ""Wait a second,"" as the aircraft descended to a position which indicated four red lights on the PAPI, if visible. The captain instructed the first officer to check radio altitude carefully. Afterward, an Auto Radio Altitude call of ""300 ft"" and ""200 ft"" were announced in a short interval, then, the captain called out for executing a go-around, and commenced raising the nose. Accordingly, the pitch angle of the aircraft was just about to increase; however, immediately after that, the aircraft collided with the Localizer antenna array, which is located 325 m before the runway 28 threshold.  The aircraft collided with the central parts of the LOC frame stand 6 m high with the both engines, both main landing gears, the flaps, the lower surface of fuselage and the horizontal stabilizers. Having collided with the LOC frame stand, the aircraft badly damaged lights of SALS and touched down on the grass area short of the runway 28 threshold with the fuselage tail, followed by the right and left main wheels followed. The aircraft smashed down ORL lights and proceeded on the runway. The left main gear folded due to severe damage, causing the left engine cowling to touch the runway surface. Subsequently, the airplane gradually veered off the runway to the left finally coming to a stop facing the southeast at the position in front of the airport boundary fence. When the purser came into the cockpit, she was told to wait and the captain gave priority to performing the Emergency Evacuation Checklist. Back in the cabin she heard flight attendants in the rear of the cabin calling and it seemed that smoke was coming up in the rear. She decided that an emergency evacuation was required, and proceeded to the forward left hand (L1) door. Having confirmed the inflation of the evacuation slide, she instructed the passengers to evacuate. The flight attendants then also began evacuating the passengers. All persons onboard were evacuated using the emergency slides and 27 persons suffered minor injuries. Probable Causes: It is certain that when landing on runway 28 at Hiroshima airport, the aircraft undershot and the PIC commenced executing a go-around; however, it collided with the Aeronautical Radio Navigation Aids located in front of runway 28 threshold, just before turning to climb.  Regarding the fact that the aircraft undershot, it is probable that there might be following aspects in causes: The PIC continued approaching without executing a goaround while the position of the aircraft could not be identified by visual references which should have been in view and identified continuously at or below the approach height threshold (Decision Altitude: DA); and as well, the first officer, as pilot-monitoring who should have monitored meteorological conditions and flight operations, did not make a call-out of go-around immediately when he could not see the runway at DA.  Regarding the fact that the PIC continued approaching without executing a goaround while the position of the aircraft could not be identified by visual references which should have been in view and identified continuously at or below DA, he did not comply with the regulations and Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), and it is probable that there was a background factor that the education and trainings for compliance of rules in the company was insufficient. In addition, regarding the fact that the first officer did not make an assertion of go-around, it is probable that the Crew Resource Management (CRM) did not function appropriatelyMETAR: 11:00 UTC / 20:00 local time: RJOA 141100Z VRB02KT 6000 -SHRA PRFG FEW000 SCT012 BKN020 09/08 Q100611:08 UTC / 20:08 local time: RJOA 141108Z VRB02KT 4000 R28/0300VP1800D -SHRA PRFG FEW000 SCT005 BKN012 09/08 Q1006 RMK 1ST000 4ST005 6CU012 A2973 1500E FG E-SWind, variable 2 knots: Visivility 4000 m: RVR, runway 28, variable between 300m and 1800m, downward: light shower of rain, partial fog: Cloud layers, 1 okta 0ft, 4 oktas 500ft, 6 oktas 1200ft: Temperature, 9 degree-Celsius: Dew-point, 8 degree-Celsius: QNH, 1006 hPa/2973 INS: Remark, Visibility 1500m for east quadrant, fog located from east to south.11:18 UTC / 20:18 local time: RJOA 141118Z 15003KT 5000 PRFG BR FEW000 SCT005 BKN012 09/09 Q1007 RMK 1ST000 4ST005 6CU012 A2974 FG BANK E-SAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: JTSB Report number: AA2016-9 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) K.Kouda; Hiroshima International Airport (HIJ); 09 June 2015 photo (c) JTSB; Hiroshima International Airport (HIJ); April 2015 photo (c) JTSB; Hiroshima International Airport (HIJ); April 2015 photo (c) JTSB; Hiroshima International Airport (HIJ); April 2015 photo (c) JTSB; Hiroshima International Airport (HIJ); 14 April 2015 photo (c) JTSB; Hiroshima International Airport (HIJ); 14 April 2015 photo (c) Felix Goetting; Beijing-Capital Airport (PEK/ZBAA); 17 October 2012 photo (c) Werner Fischdick; Seoul-Incheon International Airport (ICN/RKSI); 06 January 2009 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot was not injured. Dark night instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) prevailed at the time of the accident and an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan had been filed for the cargo flight. The airplane departed from Garfield County Regional Airport (RIL), Colorado, at 22:37 and was destined for Denver International Airport (DEN), Colorado The pilot reported that during climb, when still well below the tops of nearby mountains, he heard a ""bang"" followed by a complete loss of power and engine fire indications from the right engine. After completing appropriate checklist items the pilot declared an emergency and diverted to Grand Junction Regional Airport (GJT), Colorado, for an instrument approach and an otherwise uneventful landing at 23:11. A postaccident examination of the airplane revealed the second stage turbine rotor from the right engine had separated. One portion of the rotor exited through the left side of the engine and nacelle structure, penetrated the right side of the fuselage, and came to rest inside the fuselage wall.

There were no significant injuries to the crew. Post-flight engineering analysis revealed that the mishap aircraft exceeded the Design Limit Load (DLL), thus rendering it unsafe for further flight.  The mishap occurred on a medium risk flying qualities test sortie out to the edges of the flight envelope. The pilot was attempting to execute a Steady Heading Sideslip (SHSS) to the RUDDER Special Alert of the Advisory Caution and Warning System (ACAWS). This is normally a prohibited maneuver, but the Director of Operations at Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC/A3) signed a waiver approving the test team to fly to this limit. The MA exceeded 14.5Â° Angle of Sideslip (AoS), triggering the RUDDER Special Alert and continued increasing AoS until it departed controlled flight, eventually tumbling to an inverted position. Shortly thereafter, the aircraft recovered from the departure and the copilot took the controls to recover from the near vertical dive. In the process of the departure and recovery, the aircraft lost approximately 5,000 feet of altitude, experienced 3.19 times the normal force acceleration (Gs), and over sped the flaps by over 100 knots. The over G exceeded the aircraft's Design Limit Load. The Accident Investigation Board (AIB) President found, by a preponderance of the evidence, the cause of this mishap was the MP's [Mishap Pilot's] excessive rudder input during the test point followed by inadequate rudder input to initiate a timely recovery from high AoS due to Overcontrolled/Undercontrolled Aircraft and Wrong Choice of Action During an Operation. Additionally, the AIB President found, by a preponderance of the evidence, the following factors substantially contributed to the mishap: Instrumentation and Warning System Issues, Spatial Disorientation, Confusion, and the fact the test team was Provided Inadequate Procedural Guidance or Publications.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: USAF AIB Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

With the target approximately 40 m from the aircraft, the target winch accelerated rapidly and the target struck the leading edge of the wing before detaching and travelling over the wing. Although, the launcher and the droop leading edge on the wing were damaged, the aircraft landed safely. The target winch is powered by a turbine, and the speed of the turbine is controlled by vent doors. The target winch had oversped due to a fault with the closed limit switch on the vent doors which prevented the doors from closing. The target accelerated during the latter stages of its recovery, causing it to strike the aircraft. The acceleration was probably due to an overspeed of the target winch as a result of the failure of the vent door closed limit switch preventing the vent doors from closing when commanded. The turbine would then have spooled up, increasing the torque and resulting in the winch accelerating.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Report number: EW/C2015/04/05 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  14 November 2023 G-FRAK Draken Europe 0 S of Exeter non Loss of control Images: photo (c) AAIB; 2015 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft and its crew were conducting a routine training mission in support of an Air Force Special Operations Command exercise. The crew consisted of cockpit crew, electronic warfare officers, intelligence operators and in-flight maintenance technicians. The pilot aborted the takeoff, and all crew members safely evacuated the aircraft. Four crewmembers received treatment for minor smoke inhalation. Fire crews arrived at approximately 18:29 and extinguished the flames. The fire burned a hole through the upper fuselage above the rear galley area of the aircraft, causing structural damage and damage to aircraft control and mission related systems. Repair cost to the aircraft is estimated at $62.4 million. The board president found by preponderance of the evidence that the cause of the mishap was a leak in the high-pressure oxygen system due to poor assembly of the system tubing at depot maintenance. Failure by L3 Communications depot maintenance personnel to tighten a retaining nut connecting a metal oxygen tube to a junction fitting above the galley properly caused an oxygen leak. This leak created a highly flammable oxygen-rich environment that ignited. The resulting fire melted the retaining nut causing the tubing to become detached from the junction fitting, feeding more oxygen to the fire, increasing its size, and causing severe damage to the airframe, galley, and mission equipment onboard the aircraft.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: USAF AIB Report number: Final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) U.S. Air Force; Bellevue-Offutt AFB, NE (OFF); 2015; (publicdomain) photo (c) U.S. Air Force; Bellevue-Offutt AFB, NE (OFF); 2015; (publicdomain) photo (c) U.S. Air Force; Bellevue-Offutt AFB, NE (OFF); 2015; (publicdomain) photo (c) U.S. Air Force; Bellevue-Offutt AFB, NE (OFF); 2015; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

Flight 5612 was operating under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Par 121 as a regularly scheduled passenger flight from Albuquerque International Sunport (KABQ), Albuquerque, New Mexico, to KPHX.  After landing in KABQ, the crew were notified via ACARS that their arrival gate had changed from B7 to B21.Â  After arriving at the gate area, the crew inadvertently lined up with gate B23 and awaited marshallers.Â  As the marshallers arrived, the crew noticed that they were aligned with the wrong gate and that a left turn to enter gate B21 was not possible due to ground obstructions. As a result, the flight crew decided to perform a right turn to return to the ramp area and then enter gate B23.Â  The B757 was parked to the right of the CRJ900 at gate B25, and was aligned at about a 45 degree angle relative to the other parking configurations. As they reached approximately 90 degrees in the turn, the first officer (FO) advised the captain they were getting too close to the wing of the B757.Â  The captain proceeded to slowly complete the right turn to exit the gate but the flight crew then felt a shudder and the FO noted possible damage to the winglet of the B757.Â  The CRJ900 continued its taxi to the proper gate and all passengers deplaned normally.Â  After engine shutdown, the captain exited the airplane to assess any damage to the CRJ900 and noticed the horizontal stabilizer leading edge was substantially damaged.

Two of the six crew members survived the accident. The aircraft took off from runway 09 at 12:54 hours local time. The pilot, co-pilot, a mechanic and three engineers were conducting a test flight from Sevilla Airport (SVQ). The aircraft was built at the Airbus plant at Sevilla and was intended for the Turkish Air Force. It was the maiden flight after assembly. Shortly after takeoff three of the four engines became stuck at high power. Initially the three engines did not respond to the crewÂs attempts to control the power setting in the normal way. Pilots then succeeded in reducing power only after selecting the thrust levers to idle. Then the engines remained stuck at idle. In an attempt to return to the airport, the aircraft struck powerlines, impacted a field and burned. An Airbus official after the accident stated that engine control software was incorrectly installed during final assembly of the aircraft. This led to engine failure and the resulting crash.METAR: 10:30 UTC / 12:30 local time: LEZL 091030Z 07010KT 030V090 CAVOK 27/09 Q1022 NOSIG11:00 UTC / 13:00 local time: LEZL 091100Z 05009KT CAVOK 28/09 Q1022 NOSIG Sources: Flightradar24  El Pais  Airbus Defence and Space   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Before departure, the pilot and copilot completed a preflight inspection of the airplane and found everything to be normal. After taking off without incident, the flight crew started running the after takeoff checklist and the pilot moved the landing gear selector handle to the up position. The crew then felt and heard a loud ""clank"" in the nose of the airplane and observed that the red or unsafe nose gear light had illuminated; recycling the landing gear handle had the same result. As the flight crew returned to the departure airport, they selected the landing gear handle to the down position and received three green landing gear down indications and completed the before landing checklist; the air traffic controller advised that the nose landing gear appeared to be straight. During the landing, the airplane touched down on the main wheels first, but once the nosewheel touched down and weight was on the nose landing gear, the airplane suddenly turned sharply 30Â° to 40Â° to the left and application of right rudder did not counter the turn. The airplane then partially traveled off the left side of the runway pavement, its left main landing gear struck a concrete runway edge-light base, then the airplane turned about 180Â° from its original direction of travel and came to rest on the left side of the runway about 1,500 ft from the end of the runway. Probable Cause and Findings: The flight crewÂs inadequate preflight inspection of the nose landing gear strut, which resulted in the nosewheel not being aligned during retraction and the subsequent loss of directional control. Contributing to the accident was the failure of the nose landing gear strut due to inadequate pressure and excessive wear.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 years and 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot was not injured. The cross-country personal flight departed Palm Springs, California, about 15:15 with a planned destination of Santa Ana, California. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed. The pilot reported that 10 minutes into the flight, he received an instrument flight rules flight plan from air traffic control (ATC). The cloud tops were at 8,500 feet and he was cleared to 6,000 ft, which put him in the clouds. Within minutes of entering the clouds, the airplane lost all electrical power, and the pilot lost contact with ATC. He climbed back out of the clouds and proceeded to the west; he found a hole in the clouds over the Pacific Ocean, descended, and turned southbound. He said partial electrical power was restored, and he tried to advise ATC of his problems. His transmissions were not understood, but he flew to Carlsbad, and received a green light from the tower personnel. He extended the landing gear and flaps but had no airspeed indicator. When the airplane touched down, the pilot realized that his landing gear had not extended. Witnesses reported that the airplane approached the runway and was faster than a normal landing, and the gear was still retracted. The pilot reported that after the loss of electrical power he did not perform any emergency procedures as the checklist was in a cabinet and not reachable; he was just trying to fly the airplane. The pilot stated that when he departed from Palm Springs, the generators were on. When asked if he attempted to reset the generators, he again stated that he did not do any emergency procedures except to fly the airplane. In a later interview, the pilot stated that he may have accidently turned on the starter switches, which would have turned off the generators and accounted for the loss of electrical power. A mechanic was dispatched to help defuel the airplane about 30 minutes after the accident. He reported that fuel was leaking from the right wing so he disconnected the battery. He opened an access panel but was unable to mechanically turn off the fuel selector valve (FSV). He reconnected the battery and went into the cockpit. He saw that the landing gear handle was in the down position, and the flap handle was in the full up position. The battery switch was in the OFF position with the battery gang bar down, which turned off the battery, generator 1, and generator 2. After lifting up the gang bar and turning on the battery switch, he saw nothing on the cockpit displays but heard the airplane power up. He located the FSV, turned it off, and confirmed with a firefighter that the solenoid in the wing audibly closed. The mechanic turned the electrical power off and disconnected the battery. The fuel leak from the right engine filter bowl stopped. It took the mechanic about 30 minutes to gather the equipment needed to defuel the airplane, and he decided to start with the right side by connecting to the engine supply line. He reconnected the battery and entered the cockpit to turn on the electrical power. With power on, the cockpit displays illuminated, and he heard the landing gear try to operate to the down position. After another mechanic pulled the circuit breaker for the avionics, he defueled the airplane. During recovery, the airplane was lifted off the ground, and the landing gear were successfully extended to the down and locked position. PROBABLE CAUSE: ""The pilot's inadvertently turning on the starter switches, which turned off the generators and resulted in a loss of electrical power and gear-up landing. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's failure to follow the emergency procedures for a loss of electrical power or to manually extend the landing gear.

The aircraft was on a positioning flight from Kevsala (Ipatovo district of the Stavropol region) to Gribnoye, carrying four drums of oil. While flying at low altitude the engine failed. The pilot carried out a forced landing at Sanamer. The aircraft ran over a fence and came to rest against a church. The airplane did not have a valid Certificate of Airworthiness at the time of the accident. Conclusion (translated from Russian): The aircraft accident with the aircraft An-2s/x RA-56528 occurred due to the collision of the aircraft with an obstacle during the forced landing. The necessity of the forced landing was caused by the engine self-absorption during the flight, most probably due to the oil tank bloating and its wall pressing on the engine stop-crane lever on the carburetor. The increase in pressure in the oil tank and its bloating were the result of deposits of soot in the drainage pipe connecting the oil tank with the atmosphere.  Contributing factors: - Absence of the tank flushing, including the tank drainage pipeline with the atmosphere provided for by the periodic maintenance after 400Â±30 hours of flight or 12Â±1 month of operation; - Maintenance of aircraft by persons who do not have a certificate of a maintenance and repair specialist; - performance of the flight over the locality at an altitude that does not allow landing outside the locality in case of aircraft malfunction; - performance of the flight by an aircraft under the influence of alcoholic intoxication of the average degree.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: MAK  Southern Investigative Department of the Investigative Committee on Transport of the Russian Federation  Lifenews.ru   Location  Images: photo (c) Interstate Aviation Committee; Sanamer, Stavropol Territory; 18 May 2015 photo (c) Interstate Aviation Committee; Sanamer, Stavropol Territory; 18 May 2015 photo (c) Interstate Aviation Committee; Sanamer, Stavropol Territory; 18 May 2015 photo (c) Interstate Aviation Committee; Sanamer, Stavropol Territory; 18 May 2015 photo (c) Interstate Aviation Committee; Sanamer, Stavropol Territory; 18 May 2015 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.
