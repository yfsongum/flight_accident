Al 167 passengers and nine crew members on board were killed. The Boeing 737-800, registration UR-PSR, had landed on schedule at 00:57 hours local time at Tehran. The return leg back to Kiev was due to depart at 05:15 local time (01:45 UTC).  In the meantime, around 02:15 hours local time in Iran, numerous ballistic missiles were fired from Iran towards U.S. bases in Iraq in response to the killing of Major General Qasem Soleimani by a United States drone strike. As a result this military operation changed the alertness level of Iran's air defense. At approximately 04:00 the military sector informed the civil sector of the country's Airspace Control that only the flights already detected and cleared for flight operations by the defense network could be permitted to start up. This would ensure the correct identification of civil flights by the defense network and avoiding targeting them by mistake. At 05:49 the doors were closed and the aircraft was ready to depart. Two minutes later the flight requested the to start up the engines. After contacting the Area Control Center, the ATC unit requested clearance for the Ukrainian flight at 05:52. The Area Control Center forwarded the request for flight PS752 to the Air Defense Coordination Center, which subsequently issued the clearance accordingly. The aircraft then taxied to runway 29R and commenced the takeoff roll at 06:11. After takeoff the flight contacted Mehrabad Radar and was cleared to climb to FL260 and turn right after reaching 6000 feet, heading direct to the PAROT reporting point. As the aircraft was climbing after departure, it appeared on the air defense system. However, a wrong initialisation procedure of the system's north alignment had induced a 107-degree error in the system. Thus, the direction of objects and targets detected by this system was being observed with an increase of 107 degrees by the operator. At 06:13:56, the air defense unit operator detected a target at his 250-degree azimuth, flying on a 52-degree course. At the same time, PS752 had been flying towards the defense system from a 143-degree azimuth. The aircraft was flying a 309-degree course. At 06:14:21, the operator notified the specifications of the detected target to the Coordination Center over the communication network.  The notification was not communicated successfully. Meanwhile the system operator began analyzing the observable information and categorized the detected target as a threat. At 06:14:41, without receiving any response from the Coordination Center, the air defense unit operator fired a missile at the threatening target he had detected.  Under the applicable procedures, if the defense system operator cannot establish communication with the Coordination Center and does not receive the fire command, they are not authorized to fire.  The missile radio fuse was activated at 06:14:59. At that point flight PS752 was at 8100 feet at a position about 20 km west-northwest of the airport. After the first missile radio fuse was activated, the air defense unit radar still locked on the target, and the defense system kept detecting and tracking it. By observing the continuity of trajectory of detected target, the second missile was fired at the aircraft by the operator of defense system at 06:15:11. At 06:45:24, the last communication between the missile and the defense system was recorded in a place close to the aircraft route. After that, the defense system showed a message indicating the strike had failed, with the aircraft clearing from the radar lock-on after some time. The aircraft turned to the right and about 06:16:11, a fire broke out on the aircraft, which was intensifying. Altitude was lost and at 06:18:23, the aircraft crashed into a playground in Khalajabad near Shahedshahr area, 15 km north of the airport. It disintegrated completely and wreckage was strewn along a 300 m long path. Cause of the Accident The air defense's launching two surface-to-air missiles at the flight PS752, UR-PSR aircraft the detonation of the first missile warhead in proximity of the aircraft caused damage to the aircraft systems and the intensification of damage led the aircraft to crash into the ground and explode instantly. Other Contributing Factors - The mitigating measures and defense layers in risk management proved to be ineffective due to the occurrence of an unanticipated error in threat identifications, and ultimately failed to protect the flight safety against the threats caused by the alertness of defense forces.METAR: 02:44 UTC /  local time: OIIE 080200Z 28006KT CAVOK M01 / M04 Q1021Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Iran Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: TSB response to accident report  Ukraine Flight 752: New Video Shows First Missile Hit Plane (NY Times, 14 Jan. 2020)   Location  Images: photo (c) FARS News Agency; near Sabashahr; 08 January 2020; (CC:by) photo (c) FARS News Agency; near Sabashahr; 08 January 2020; (CC:by) photo (c) FARS News Agency, Hossein Mersadi; near Sabashahr; 08 January 2020; (CC:by) photo (c) FARS News Agency, Hossein Mersadi; near Sabashahr; 08 January 2020; (CC:by) photo (c) FARS News Agency, Hossein Mersadi; near Sabashahr; 08 January 2020; (CC:by) photo (c) FARS News Agency, Hossein Mersadi; near Sabashahr; 08 January 2020; (CC:by) photo (c) FARS News Agency, Hossein Mersadi; near Sabashahr; 08 January 2020; (CC:by) photo (c) FARS News Agency, Hossein Mersadi; near Sabashahr; 08 January 2020; (CC:by) photo (c) FARS News Agency, Hossein Mersadi; near Sabashahr; 08 January 2020; (CC:by) photo (c) CAO Iran; near Sabashahr; 08 January 2020 photo (c) Gilles Brion; GenÃ¨ve-Cointrin Airport (GVA/LSGG); 23 April 2017 photo (c) Arno Janssen; Jetfotos.de; DÃ¼sseldorf International Airport (DUS/EDDL); 25 March 2018 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates09-Oct-2024 13:55 ASN Updated [Destination airport, Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Of the 159 passengers and crew onboard, one flight attendant sustained serious injuries.  The airplane was not damaged. The flight was operating under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 as a regularly scheduled passenger flight from the KMSY to Newark Liberty International Airport (KEWR), Newark, New Jersey.   According to the flight crew, they advised the flight attendants (FA) to expect some light turbulence during the climb out, and stated they would leave the seatbelt sign illuminated for passengers until they had reached smooth air.  During the climb to their assigned altitude of flight level (FL) 370, the weather radar was active and air traffic control advised of weather directly in front of the flight.  As the flight was climbing through about FL 305 , the flight was in clear air but the crew realized they were not going to stay above the clouds ahead of the airplane and requested, and were approved, to deviate to the right to avoid the buildups.  During the turn, the captain made an announcement on the public address (PA) system for the FAs to 'take their jumpseatsâ and subsequently encountered 'a couple bumps of light chop.â  Almost immediately after, they received a call from the cabin, that the purser had been injured.   According to the FAs, they were preparing for cabin service when the turbulence was encountered. The forward FA fell to the floor as she was walking through the first-class cabin.  Subsequently, the flight crew's announcement for the 'flight attendants take your jump seatsâ came over the PA system.  The injured FA was assisted by medically qualified passengers and remained in a passenger seat for the remainder of the flight. Paramedics met the airplane at the gate and the FA was transported to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a fractured ankle. Post accident examination of the weather data determined that the turbulence was encountered when the airplane was flying over an area of general thunderstorms.  Cloud tops up to FL400 were located within 10 miles of the turbulence encounter but there were no pilot reports (PIREPs) in the vicinity indicating turbulence prior to the event.  There was a Center Weather Advisory current for the area for isolated thunderstorms, which was included in the flights weather briefing.

The aircraft operated on a service from Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport, Russia. The flight was cleared for an approach to runway 36C at Antalya Airport. During the base leg of the approach, the autopilot and autothrottle were disengaged. The aircraft was further configured for landing and the approach was stabled at 1035 feet altitude, 3 nm and from the runway. When descending below 270 feet (about 100ft agl) the airspeed decreased below the approach speed of 122 kt to a value to 109 at 20 feet above the runway. The pitch was 5.5Â° nose-up and idle thrust was selected. Then the captain abruptly moved the sidestick fully forward, holding it there for 1.5 seconds and causing the nose to drop. Full power was added and its nose-gear struck the runway with a 2.64g impact. The Airbus bounced and the captain pulled the sidestick to execute a go-around. The aircraftÂs flight-control system switched to direct law, two inertial reference systems failed, and attitude indications disappeared from the captainÂs instruments. Although the flaps were partially retracted during the go-around, the undercarriage could not be retracted. Smoke entered the cockpit and the flight declared a Mayday. Subsequently a low pass was made over runway 36C so the Tower could assess the damage to the aircraft. Then a dual hydraulic failure occurred, and the fight again declared a Mayday. A left-hand visual approach was flown to runway 36C and the aircraft landed. The runway was vacated and the aircraft was then shut down. The airline only notified the Russian Interstate Aviation Committee on January 14, four days after the accident. Investigators believes that after the accident both the voice recorder (CVR) as well as the flight data recorder (FDR) were removed by RMS Technic in Antalya. The voice recorder was fitted to a second Airbus A321 (VP-BHN) flying the return service to Moscow. After arrival in Moscow, it was removed by another maintenance firm and transported back to RMS Technic in Antalya where the recorder was refitted to the original damaged A321, before the inquiry team arrived. The investigation is ongoing.METAR: 04:04 UTC / 07:04 local time: LTAI 100404Z 36018G29KT CAVOK 07/M06 Q1018 NOSIG RMK RWY18C 36021KT RWY36R 35018G29KT RWY18L 35018G30KT04:20 UTC / 07:20 local time: LTAI 100420Z 01014KT CAVOK 07/M06 Q1019 NOSIG RMK RWY18C 01016G27KT RWY36R 36014G26KT RWY18L 36016KT04:50 UTC / 07:50 local time: LTAI 100450Z 02016G26KT CAVOK 07/M06 Q1019 NOSIG RMK RWY18C 03012KT RWY36R 36016KT RWY18L 02012KTAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: airporthaber.com  @AshedShadow   Location  Images: photo (c) MAK; Antalya Airport (AYT); January 2020 photo (c) MAK; Antalya Airport (AYT); January 2020 photo (c) MAK; Antalya Airport (AYT); January 2020 photo (c) Dmitrii Ermakov; Saint Petersburg-Pulkovo Airport (LED/ULLI); 19 May 2018 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

In the cockpit, the PIC was in the left pilotâs seat as Pilot Monitoring, a trainee in the FO promotion training in the right pilotâs seat as Pilot Flying and the FO was in the observer seat. When reaching an altitude of 10,000 ft during the climb, the flight crew members confirmed that there were no clouds on the climb route, and turned off the seat belt sign in the cabin around 13:12 JST. After that, the aircraft continued to climb to the cruising altitude of FL320. After the seat belt sign was turned off, based on the weather information confirmed prior to their departure, the PIC anticipated the possibility that they might encounter turbulence during the climb, thus he was thinking of how to respond, such as promptly turning on the seat belt sign to have the cabin crew members seated, when detecting a sign of turbulence. On the other hand, in the cabin, after the seat belt sign was turned off, cabin crew members started selling duty-free goods and distributing immigration cards. The senior cabin crew member moved to the aft galley to take care of passengers.  Until reaching an altitude of about FL 250 after the seat belt sign was turned off, the aircraft had neither entered clouds nor encountered turbulence, and any sign of turbulence was not confirmed on the airborne weather radar and other instrument indications. However, around 13:17 immediately after reaching FL 250, the aircraft was strongly shaken all of sudden, therefore the PIC turned on the seat belt sign at once. At this time, the PIC instructed the cabin crew members to be seated promptly. When this shaking occurred, the purser in the center of the aft galley was standing facing forward of the cabin, but fell down to the right not being able to support herself. Afterward, being seated in her seat located near the aft galley, the purser confirmed that she had pain in her right ankle and suffered abrasions.  Turbulence ceased after reaching FL 270, and the flight reported to Fukuoka Air Traffic Control that they encountered turbulence.  The PIC then judged that it would be possible to fly to Incheon International Airport, their destination. The purser was diagnosed with a lateral malleolus fracture in her right ankle in a hospital in Seoul City.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JTSB Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: JTSB  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates17-Jun-2024 10:54 ASN Updated [Category, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The Aircraft had 526 persons onboard, consisting of two flight crewmembers, 24 cabin crewmembers and 500 passengers. The commander, occupying the left seat, was the pilot flying (PF). He stated that prior to the turbulence encounter, the daylight flight was uneventful with no avoidance actions required due to weather. After entering BEIRA flight information region (FIR), Mozambique, at flight level (FL) FL400 close to waypoint OKBIM, the flight crew stated that there was light turbulence with the weather radar displaying that the weather was off-path on the navigation display (ND) and beneath the aircraft. Soon after, several magenta spots appeared on the weather radar along the flight path indicating that there were areas of wet turbulence within 40 nautical miles (NM) ahead of the aircraft. At 1314:24 UTC, approximately six hours after departure from OMDB, the aircraft experienced moderate to severe turbulence at FL400 within BEIRA FIR. The operational flight plan (OFP) significant aeronautical weather chart had forecast the occasional presence of convective weather activity containing embedded cumulonimbus clouds (CB) up to an altitude of 52,000 feet (ft) in this area. During the turbulence encounter, the Aircraft autopilot and autothrust remained engaged and there were no operational exceedances. The turbulence lasted for approximately 30 seconds and resulted in a serious leg injury to an unsecured passenger on the upper deck. There was no reported damage to the aircraft cabin. The commander decided to continue the flight to the destination as the passengerâs injury was non-life threatening and the aircraft performance was not affected. The remainder of the flight, lasting 1 hour 46 minutes, was uneventful. Causes The Air Accident Investigation Sector of the United Arab Emirates (AAIS) determines that the cause of the Accident was the severe turbulence of vertical gust forces imposed on the Aircraft as it operated within an area associated with wet turbulence cells, resulting in the forceful movement of unsecured passengers and cabin crewmembers. Contributing Factors The Investigation determines that the following were contributory factors to the Accident: (a) After entering BEIRA FIR and wet turbulence was detected by the weather radar turbulence function, the flight crew did not use the full capabilities of the weather radar to obtain an accurate assessment of the distance of the area of greatest threat from the Aircraft flight path. (b) There was insufficient time for the cabin crew to secure the cabin after the seat belt sign was turned ON.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: GCAA Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: GCAA Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

The airplane ended up 400 or 500 yards offshore in the waters of Unalaska Bay near Hog Island and sank. The three occupants were rescued. According to the pilot, after checking the weather on the Automated Weather Observing System (AWOS), he completed the before takeoff check list, back taxied for a runway 31 departure and initiated the takeoff roll. He said he recalled the winds being reported as 100Â° at 9 knots. As the airplane accelerated down the runway, he said the airspeed was about 75 knots at midfield and increasing. When the airspeed reached about 90 knots, he applied back pressure to the control yoke to initiate the takeoff and noted a brief positive rate of climb, followed by a sinking sensation. The airspeed rapidly decayed, and the stall warning horn sounded. In an effort to correct for the decaying airspeed, he lowered the nose and immediately noticed the airplane's lights reflecting off the surface of the water. He pulled back on the airplane's control yoke and leveled the wings just before impacting the ocean waters.  A tailwind takeoff was performed since IFR takeoff minimums and (obstacle) departure procedures only allow for night departures off of runway 31.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ANC20LA015 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: adn.com  kucb.org  Flightaware   Location  Images: photo (c) Bas Velders; Anchorage-Ted Stevens International Airport, AK (ANC/PANC); 07 April 2016 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft had departed MontrÃ©al-Pierre Elliott Trudeau Airport (CYUL) at 07:06 hours local time on a multi-stop flight to Salluit. The accident occurred on the second leg, from MontrÃ©al to Schefferville. Findings as to causes and contributing factors: 1. The pilots forgot to perform the descent checklist and realized this at an inopportune time, when the pilot monitoring was providing a position report. 2. Given the ambiguities and contradictions in the stabilized approach guidelines, the captain interpreted that he was allowed to continue the approach below 500 feet above aerodrome elevation although the flaps had not been set to 35Â° and the final checklist had not been completed. 3. Communicating with the flight attendant to confirm the cabin status and performing the descent checklist during final approach added to the pilotsÂ workload, which was already heavy. 4. The combination of the visual conditions and the plan continuation bias prompted the pilots to continue managing the height and speed deviations past the stabilized approach gate. 5. When the aircraft passed 500 feet above aerodrome elevation, the pilots, who were dealing with a heavy workload, passed the stabilized approach gate without noticing it and continued the approach, which was de facto unstable. 6. At the time of the flare, the aircraft no longer had enough energy to stop the rate of descent solely by increasing the pitch attitude. 7. The instinctive reaction to increase the pitch attitude, combined with the hard landing, resulted in the aft fuselage striking the runway, causing major damage to the aircraftÂs structure.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A20Q0013 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  9 February 2024 C-GXAI Air Inuit 0 Tasiujuaq Airport, QC (YTQ/CYTQ) min Collision with other aircraft on apron Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

On approach to FAGG, the flying crew requested to carry out a calibration flight for the very high frequency omnidirectional range (VOR) beacon at FAGG. Due to inclement weather conditions at the time, they were not cleared to conduct VOR calibration. As a result, they decided to land and refuel the aircraft before commencing with the calibration of the Instrument Landing System (ILS) on runway 11 at FAGG. The flying crew requested take-off from runway 11 and an early right turn to intercept radial 250Â°, 17 nautical miles (nm) DME arc to radial 330Â° at 3000 feet (ft) climbing to 4000ft.

Radar data indicated that at 10:42, the aircraft took off from runway 11 and, once airborne, made a right-hand turn to intercept radial 250Â° using the George VOR (GRV VOR). The aircraft climbed to 3000ft. Once the aircraft reached 17nm on the DME from the GRV VOR (DME is co-located with the VOR), it commenced with a right-hand turn to intercept radial 330Â° while maintaining 17nm DME arc. At 10:46, the ATC at FAGG advised the flying crew that they were now exiting controlled airspace and were advised to broadcast on the special rules frequency. The crew acknowledged the advisory to change frequency and there was no further communication. The aircraft was still being monitored by ATC using secondary surveillance radar. At 10:50, radar data showed the aircraft crossing radial 310Â° and entered a climb from 3000ft, reaching 3900ft. As the aircraft levelled off at 3900ft, a rapid descent occurred, and the aircraft lost 1500ft in approximately 9 seconds. Three seconds prior to impact, the aircraft nose pitched up before impacting a ridge at 2192ft. Probable Cause: The crew lost control of the aircraft which resulted in significant loss of altitude; as they attempted to recover, they collided with the mountain. According to the SAWS report, there was significant cloud coverage below 1500 ft above ground level at the time of the accident as observed in the METARs. Mountain tops were obscured as seen on the Webcam. The aircraft route which is 17 N.M arc passes over the obscured mountains. From the limited FDR reading the aircraft attitude drastically changed into an unusual attitude when approaching the mountain area .This indicates that most probably, the pilot has entered into an unusual attitude during transition from VFR to IFR flight without preparation. The accident flight plan was VFR. Contributing Factors: 1. The presence of low clouds at about 1500ft below above ground and obscured mountains with clouds; 2. The incapability of the crew to recover from unusual attitude; lack of supervision and disregard of the Civil Aviation Regulations requirements by the FIU (operator). 3. Overbanked and steep dive maneuver, unable to gain the required altitude before impact; 4. Lack of upset prevention and recovery technique (UPRT);METAR: 08:00 UTC / 10:00 local time: FAGG 230800Z 11012KT 070V130 9999 FEW008 SCT011 BKN023 18/16 Q101810:00 UTC / 12:00 local time: FAGG 231000Z 11015KT 9999 FEW010 SCT015 BKN030 19 /// Q1018Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Ethiopia Report number: CA18/2/3/9855 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: timeslive.co.za  S.A.

All three crew members died in the accident. The aircraft, contracted to the New South Wales Rural Fire Service, departed Richmond RAAF Base, Australia at 12:05 local time. The crew had been tasked with a fire retardant drop over the ÂAdaminaby ComplexÂ bush fire. After approaching the Adaminaby complex fire, the drop was unable to be completed and the aircraft was diverted to a secondary tasking, to drop retardant on the ÂGood GoodÂ fire. Witnesses reported seeing the aircraft complete a number of circuits, prior to completing the retardant drop. The drop was conducted on a heading of about 190Â°, at about 200 ft above ground level, with a drop time of approximately 2 seconds. The crew released about 1,200 US gallons (4,500 L) of fire retardant during the drop. Witness videos taken of the aircraft leading up to the accident showed a number of passes conducted at varying heights prior to the retardant drop. Following the retardant drop, the aircraft was observed to bank left, before becoming obscured by smoke after about 5 seconds. A further 15 seconds after this, the aircraft was seen flying at a very low height above the ground, in a left wing down attitude. Shortly after, at about 13:16, the aircraft collided with terrain and a post-impact fuel-fed fire ensued. The three crew were fatally injured and the aircraft was destroyed. Contributing factors: - Hazardous weather conditions were forecast and present at the drop site near Peak View, which included strong gusting winds and mountain wave activity, producing turbulence. These conditions were likely exacerbated by the fire and local terrain. - The Rural Fire Service continued the B134 tasking to Adaminaby when they learned that no other aircraft would continue to operate due to the environmental conditions. In addition, they relied on the pilot in command to assess the appropriateness of the tasking to Adaminaby without providing them all the available information to make an informed decision on flight safety. - The pilot in command of B134 accepted the Adaminaby fire-ground tasking, which was in an area of forecast mountain wave activity and severe turbulence. After assessing the conditions as unsuitable, the crew accepted an alternate tasking to continue to the Good Good (Peak View) fire-ground, which was subject to the same weather conditions. The acceptance of these taskings were consistent with company practices. - Following the partial retardant drop and left turn, the aircraft was very likely subjected to hazardous environmental conditions including low-level windshear and an increased tailwind component, which degraded the aircraftÂs climb performance. - While at a low height and airspeed, it was likely the aircraft aerodynamically stalled, leading to a collision with terrain. - Coulson Aviation's safety risk management processes did not adequately manage the risks associated with large air tanker operations. There were no operational risk assessments conducted or a risk register maintained. Further, as safety incident reports submitted were mainly related to maintenance issues, operational risks were less likely to be considered or monitored. Overall, this limited their ability to identify and implement mitigations to manage the risks associated with their aerial firefighting operations. (Safety issue) - Coulson Aviation did not provide a pre-flight risk assessment for their firefighting large air tanker crews. This would provide predefined criteria to ensure consistent and objective decision-making with accepting or rejecting tasks, including factors relating to crew, environment, aircraft and external pressures. (Safety issue) - The New South Wales Rural Fire Service had limited large air tanker policies and procedures for aerial supervision requirements and no procedures for deployment without aerial supervision. (Safety issue) - The New South Wales Rural Fire Service did not have a policy or procedures in place to manage task rejections, nor to communicate this information internally or to other pilots working in the same area of operation.

The two pilots and two passengers were not injured.  According to the pilot, the instrument approach to runway 09 was ""stabilized, on glide path, and on speed."" The landing reference speed (Vref) was 122 knots and touchdown occurred at the 1,000 ft markers. The thrust reversers were deployed until 70 knots. The pilot then noticed standing water on the runway, and as the airplane encountered the standing water, it yawed to the right and departed the runway. The airplane impacted a chain-link fence and sustained substantial damage to the right wing spar. The pilot further reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation. Weather observations at TJIG were reported only when the air traffic control tower was open (0700 to 1900), and there were no automated weather observation stations at the airport. The last available observation occurred at 1745, which indicated that rain showers were in the vicinity of the airport to the southwest and northwest.

The aircraft, from 430th EECS, was outfitted with a Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) and operated as a communications-relay platform out of Kandahar Airport, Afghanistan. At the time of the accident the aircraft operated on a combat sortie as well as a Mission Qualification Training for the first officer. Takeoff occurred at 11:05 local time. The flight proceeded to the assigned orbit using standard departure/climb procedures. The crew assumed a circular orbit just west of Kabul at 42,000 feet altitude at about 11:36. At 12:50, the crew requested and was cleared by ATC to climb from 42,000 feet altitude to 43,000 feet altitude. The engine revolutions per minute (RPMs) advanced and the crew initiated the climb with the autopilot, gaining about 300 feet. At 12:50:52, a fan blade broke free and separated from the N1 first-stage turbofan of the left engine, causing major damage and resulting in the immediate shutdown of that engine by the Electronic Engine Controller (EEC), a subsystem of the Full Authority Digital Engine Controller (FADEC). This was accompanied by a bang. Simultaneous with the bang, the CVR recording stopped.  Within one to two seconds after the initial event, the autothrottles disengaged automatically. The autopilot was engaged and it remained engaged. Bank angles remained essentially constant, consistent with a circular orbit, and the aircraft descended from an altitude of 42,300 feet to 41,000 feet. Ten seconds after the catastrophic left engine failure, the crew retarded both throttles to just less than halfway (14 degrees; total throttle range is from 0 Â 40 degrees) for one second, then slightly advancing the left throttle separately (26 degrees) for one second, then retarding it to align with the right throttle (both at 16 degrees) for one second, and finally splitting the throttles to advance the left throttle (to 31 degrees) while retarding the right to idle (0 degrees). Nine seconds after moving the right throttle to idle, the crew placed the right engine run switch to off, shutting down the right engine. Finally, at 12:51:19, the left throttle was advanced to full power (40 degrees), briefly cycled then brought to idle. At 12:51:23, both throttles were advanced from idle to full power. It is likely the crewÂs first actions, including the shutdown, were hastened by a sense of urgency due to aircraft vibrations and other auditory/sensory cues, reinforced by the startle response. The crew announced to Kabul ATC that they had lost both engines and that they intended to proceed to Kandahar, which was well outside the E-11A glide capabilities. This intent suggests that the crew was confident of airstarting one or both engines. While the crew would have waited, in accordance with the checklist, to 30,000 feet to attempt an airstart, an airstart of the right engine should have been successful, whether accomplished with windmilling airspeed or with the assistance of the APU. However, airstarts of the left engine would have failed due to the original damage. There is no DFDR data to definitively confirm whether an engine airstart attempt was made. At 13:03:30, the crew announced to ATC that they were going to land at FOB Sharana. The aircraft continued to glide without engine power and was not able to reach Sharana. At approximately 13:09, the aircraft impacted the ground approximately 21 NM (39 km) short of Sharana, on a heading of roughly 140 degrees, consistent with a direct flight path towards Sharana. The terrain was unpopulated, largely flat, and covered in snow. The wings show the slats out and the flaps appear to be extended, suggesting that the aircraft had been configured for, and presumably slowed for, landing. It is likely that the crew attempted to make a forced landing. While the terrain was largely flat, the aircraft impacted berms and ditches, roughly estimated between 3-6 feet high. Weather at Sharana was reported to have 1000 foot ceilings, and pilot testimony confirms approximately 1000 foot ceilings in the vicinity of the accident site. Accordingly, the crew may have had less than a minute to maneuver after exiting the clouds and seeing the terrain. It appears that while the aircraft touched down, it impacted a smaller berm almost immediately, then more completely impacted the ground and skidded to a halt in approximately 340 meters. During this time the wings were ripped from the aircraft, and subsequently much of the cockpit and cabin were destroyed by fire. The Accident Investigation Board (AIB) President found by a preponderance of the evidence that the cause of the mishap was the MC's error in analyzing which engine had catastrophically failed (left engine). This error resulted in the MC's decision to shutdown the operable right engine creating a dual engine out emergency. The AIB President also found by a preponderance of the evidence that the MC's failure to airstart the right engine and their decision to recover the MA to KAF substantially contributed to the mishap.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: USAF AIB Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-recovers-two-killed-in-air-force-crash-in-taliban-territory-11580232907  https://www.airforcetimes.com/news/your-air-force/2021/01/21/broken-fan-blade-shutdown-of-wrong-engine-led-to-fatal-e-11-crash-in-afghanistan-report-says/  https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2020/01/27/us-army-investigating-plane-crash-in-taliban-held-area/  https://aerossurance.com/air-accidents-incidents/usaf-e11a-global-express-psmicr/  https://www.acc.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/2478327/e-11a-accident-investigation-board-report-released/  https://www.afjag.af.mil/Portals/77/AIB-Reports/2020/27JAN20%20ACC%20Bagram%20Airfield%20E-11%20AIB%20Report.pdf  Location  Images: photo (c) Bart Hoekstra; Mildenhall RAF Station (MHZ/EGUN); 11 March 2019 Media: Startled Shutdown - Fatal USAF E-11A Global Express PSM+ICR Accident: The crew shut down the serviceable engine and try to reach an airfield 230 NM away rather than ones close by. aerossurance.com/air-accident... #military #accident #flightsafety #aviationsafety #humanfactors[image or embed]— Aerossurance (@aerossurance.bsky.social) January 3, 2025 at 11:46 AMStartled Shutdown - Fatal USAF E-11A Global Express PSM+ICR Accident: The aircraft force lands in Afghanistan and burns out.  aerossurance.com/air-accident... #military #accident #flightsafety #aviationsafety #humanfactors[image or embed]— Aerossurance (@aerossurance.bsky.social) January 3, 2025 at 11:48 AMRevision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates30-Dec-2024 13:07 Aerossurance Updated [Source, ]31-Dec-2024 15:34 Aerossurance Updated [Source, ]31-Dec-2024 17:21 Aerossurance Updated [Operator, Source, Embed code, Narrative, ]01-Jan-2025 11:36 Aerossurance Updated [Narrative, ]02-Jan-2025 16:05 Aerossurance Updated [Source, ]03-Jan-2025 11:49 Aerossurance Updated [Embed code, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The aircraft stopped 90 meters beyond the paved end of the runway stopway in the middle of a road. All occupants safely evacuated the aircraft. The aircraft took off from Tehran-Mehrabad Airport at 06:24 hours local time and climbed to the cruising altitude of FL320. The flight was subsequently cleared direct to GODMO. After contacting the controller at Mahshahr the crew was informed: ""runway active is 31; wind is now 280/08kts, CAVOK, temperature +06, DP 04 and QNH 1023, expected VOR approach runway 31 via GODMO 1E Arrival"". The flight responded by requesting runway 13 for landing. ATC then cleared the flight for a VOR/DME approach to runway 13 using the GODMO 1F Arrival procedure. At 07:30:41 local time, the pilot reported over position GODMO at FL100. ATC replied: ""CPN 6936 yes sir; descend as profile to MNM 2000 feet for VOR/DME APP RWY 13, report when leaving IAF and cleared approach."" At 07:32:46, the pilot reported leaving the Initial Approach Fix (IAF) MNM. At that time the aircraft was flying at an altitude at 6647 ft instead of 2000 ft as required. The controller cleared the flight to land. As the aircraft passed 2500 ft, the autopilot was disengaged. Then the captain decided to control altitude and speed by executing an S-turn maneuver several times and continued in visual reference with the ground. At 07:35:29, at altitude 934 ft, the captain asked the copilot to set speed and the copilot called out the target airspeed of 135 knots when the actual speed (IAS) at the time was 196 kt.  Upon receiving EGPWS Sink Rate warnings, the copilot warned the pilot to read the landing checklist, but the captain did not accept this and accomplished an unstabilized high-speed approach for the purpose of landing.  The copilot claimed in his statement after the accident that: ""I wanted to take control of the aircraft and follow missed approach procedure but due to pilot over-confidence to overcome present situation and age gap, I disregarded it."" The captain was a 64-year old pilot with over 18000 flying hours, compared to the 28-year old copilot who had 300 hours. From 1000 ft until 10 ft altitude, sink rate and pull up warnings sounded in the cockpit successively. Finally, at 07:36:11, the aircraft landed with high speed (171 kt) after passing two-thirds of the runway. It touched down nosegear-first and bounced. Full auto thrust reversers and brakes were applied. The aircraft overran the runway, rolled through a non-paved area and airport perimeter fence, passed a shallow canal then onto an adjacent roadway, where it struck a concrete median strip and a lamp post before coming to a stop.  Runway 13 has a Landing Distance Available (LDA) of 8874 feet (2705 m). Probable Causes: The Aircraft Accident Investigation Board determines that the probable causes of this accident were the pilotsÂ failures below, resulting in a runway overrun: - Poor decision-making for acceptance of the risk of high-speed landing; - Un-stabilized approach against the normal flight profile; - Poor CRM in the cockpit; and - Poor judgment and not accomplishing go-around while performing an unstabilized approach. Contributing Factors: - Loading of 5 tons of extra fuel, which increased the landing distance required. - Decision to make a landing on RWY 13 with tailwind. - Inability of the copilot (PM) to take control of the aircraft and proper action to execute go-around.METAR: 03:00 UTC / 06:30 local time: OIAM 270300Z 29008KT 8000 NSC 06/04 Q102204:00 UTC / 07:30 local time: OIAM 270400Z 28006KT CAVOK 06/04 Q102305:00 UTC / 08:30 local time: OIAM 270500Z 29006KT 7000 NSC 07/05 Q1023Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Iran Report number: A981107EPCPZ Status: Investigation completedDuration: 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: CAO Iran   Location  Images: photo (c) Mehr News, Ahmad Rostami; Bandar Mahshahr Airport (MRX/OIAM); 27 January 2020 photo (c) Mehr News, Ahmad Rostami; Bandar Mahshahr Airport (MRX/OIAM); 27 January 2020 photo (c) Mehr News, Ahmad Rostami; Bandar Mahshahr Airport (MRX/OIAM); 27 January 2020 photo (c) Mehr News, Ahmad Rostami; Bandar Mahshahr Airport (MRX/OIAM); 27 January 2020 photo (c) Mehr News, Ahmad Rostami; Bandar Mahshahr Airport (MRX/OIAM); 27 January 2020 photo (c) Mehr News, Ahmad Rostami; Bandar Mahshahr Airport (MRX/OIAM); 27 January 2020 photo (c) AAIB Iran; Bandar Mahshahr Airport (MRX); 27 January 2020 photo (c) Javidfa; Tehran-Mehrabad Airport (THR/OIII); 01 June 2017; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

It was snowing at the time of the accident.  During the landing roll on runway 33, the aircraft departed the cleared area of the runway to the left, contacted a windrow, travelled partially off the runway surface, returned to the runway and stopped. The damage to the aircraft included the nose wheel collapsing and damage to the right propeller blades. The aircraft was ferried to Kelowna on May 27 and resumed service after final repairs on June 10, 2020. Findings as to causes and contributing factors 1. Given the falling snow and the snow-covered runway, there were limited visual cues available to the flight crew, which decreased their ability to accurately judge the aircraftÂs lateral position once it was beyond the threshold. 2. Snow clearing operations cleared the centre 100 feet of the runway, which resulted in windrows that were approximately 18 inches high along the edges of the cleared area. This reduced the pilotÂs lateral manoeuvring room during the landing. 3. The aircraft initially touched down 10 feet left of the centreline due to control inputs and variable wind conditions and, while the aircraft was still in a light weight-on-wheels condition, a gust contributed to a further deviation to the left until the left main landing gear came into contact with the windrow. 4. As the left main landing gear impacted the windrow, the drag on that landing gear caused the aircraft to pull to the left, causing the nose and right main landing gear to also come into contact with the windrow. 5. During the runway excursion, snow and ice became packed in the nose landing gear bay and caused structural deformation. Consequently, the nose landing gear was no longer being held in place and collapsed rearward into the fuselage, causing substantial damage to the aircraft.METAR: 04:00 UTC / 20:00 local time: CYXT 010400Z 35015G24KT 3/4SM -SN VV003 00/M00 A2903 RMK SN8 /S05/ SLP84105:00 UTC / 21:00 local time: CYXT 010500Z 03009KT 3/4SM -SN VV003 00/M00 A2903 RMK SN8 SLP84105:23 UTC / 21:23 local time: CYXT 010523Z 02010KT 3/4SM -SN VV003 00/M00 A2903 RMK SN8 SLP83906:00 UTC / 22:00 local time: CYXT 010600Z 35009G15KT 1SM -SN OVC010 00/00 A2905 RMK SN5SC3 /S08/ PRESRR SLP848Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A20P0013 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: TSB A20P0013 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  19 July 2019 C-FKWE WestJet Encore 0 Edmonton International Airport, AB (YEG) sub 4 September 2022 C-FKWE WestJet 0 25nm W of Moncton International Airport, NB (YQM/CYQM) unk Location  Images: photo (c) Leslie Snelleman; Vancouver International Airport, BC (YVR/CYVR); 27 May 2017 photo (c) RenÃ© Verschuur; Vancouver International Airport, BC (YVR/CYVR); 07 August 2015 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight had 361 persons onboard consisting of four flight crew, 24 cabin crew and 333 passengers. During cruise at flight level (FL) 330, in the airspace above Trout Peak, Rocky Mountains, Wyoming, the aircraft experienced moderate to severe turbulence at around 02:14 UTC, approximately 1 hour and 42 minutes after departure from KLAX.  The commander was the pilot flying. Because there was neither any significant weather in the area nor air traffic control reports of any turbulence, the commander had switched the seatbelt sign OFF after the aircraft had passed FL100 during the climb. The turbulence started just after the commander had initiated the climb to FL350 and he reacted by immediately turning the seatbelt sign ON and making a passenger announcement for cabin crew to take their seat. During the turbulence, which lasted for about one minute and 54 seconds. the aircraft airspeed increased but the maximum operating Mach (MMO) speed was not exceeded. The aircraft autopilot and autothrust remained engaged during the turbulence. The vertical speed of the aircraft varied between minus 580 feet per minute and positive 1,400 feet per minute with vertical gravitational g-loads between positive 0.44 G and positive 1.63 G. Amongst all persons onboard the aircraft, one passenger was injured which was classified as a serious injury. There was no reported damage to the aircraft cabin. The flight continued to the destination where the aircraft landed uneventfully. Causes The Air Accident Investigation Sector determines that the cause of the Accident was the acceleration forces imposed on the Aircraft as it flew through an area of clear air turbulence, which resulted in an unsecured passenger forcefully impacting cabin furnishings in the lavatory. Contributing Factors Lack of placarded instructions and inaccessibility of the handholds within the lavatory for use in case of turbulence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: GCAA Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: GCAA Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

Of the 8 occupants onboard, the commercial pilot and six adult passengers, along with one infant passenger, were not injured.  Day instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident, and an instrument flight plan was filed. The flight originated from HPB, about 15:58, and was destined for Bethel, Alaska (BET). According to the captain, the weather conditions the day of the accident consisted of snow, low visibility, and flat light. The original flight departure time had been delayed about 3 hours due to weather. The scheduled route of flight was from Bethel (BET), to Scammon Bay (SCM), to HPB, to Chevak (VAK), returning to BET with various passengers and cargo pick-ups and drop-offs along the route. Prior to departure from BET he received runway reports from his dispatcher that all destination airport runways were ready. He also obtained weather at all three destinations. He then did a risk analysis and gathered more weather before deeming the flight conditions good to dispatch the flight. While enroute to HPB he gathered weather for VAK and determined that the VAK portion of the flight would be canceled due to deteriorating weather. Once in HPB he landed without incident on the snow covered runway. He then called Grant dispatch in BET and informed that he would take all the passengers going to BET since he had canceled his flight to VAK; he loaded 7 passengers total and their bags. During the time on the ground, while waiting for passengers, a twin-engine King Air airplane landed and departed the runway with no incident. The pilot then back taxied for a runway 13 departure at HPB. He stated that flat light conditions prevailed, and it was difficult to see down the runway or have any depth perception. He initiated the takeoff with 20 degrees of flap selected and noticed no issues during the initial takeoff roll. He then noticed the airspeed was not increasing fast enough, witnessed the end of the runway approaching, and decided he could not abort the takeoff in time. Committed to the takeoff the airplane became airborne and the stall warning horn activated as the airplane cleared the departure end of the runway. The pilot attempted to get the airplane into ground effect, but the airplane settled, and the main landing gear encountered the snow covered terrain. Subsequently, the airplane's speed decreased, the nose wheel descended and encountered the snow, and the airplane came to rest upright about 150 ft from the end of the runway. All crew and passengers evacuated the airplane, and nobody was injured. The pilot added that the snow on the runway during departure was about 3-5 inches of wet heavy snow. Probable Cause: The pilotÂs decision to depart from a contaminated runway, and his failure to make a timely decision to abort the takeoff when the airplane was not accelerating as expected. Contributing to the accident was the pilotÂs decision to depart in limited visibility conditions, which likely affected his ability to determine the available runway distance remaining during the takeoff.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ANC20LA020 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  24 February 2002 N454SF Grant Aviation 0 Tununak, Alaska sub 13 December 2005 N454SF Grant Aviation 0 Newtok, Alaska sub Runway excursion 15 January 2008 N454SF Grant Aviation 0 Bethel, Alaska sub Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were 183 occupants on the aircraft. Three passengers died, the remaining 180 occupants were injured. The aircraft departed Izmir Airport at 17:22 hours. At the time the flight arrived in the vicinity of  Istanbul-Sabiha GÃ¶kÃ§en Airport, a thunderstorm was passing. Runway in use was 06. About 18:17 the Tower controller cleared another flight for takeoff from runway 06, reporting wind 300 degrees at 11 knots, gusting to 21 knots. The subsequent arrival was flight 2193, which was cleared to land with wind information given as 270 degrees at 22 knots, gusting to 30 knots. This translates to a 19 knot tailwind. Since the wind was shifting the controller reported to a flight on the ground that it was to expect a runway change for departure. At 18:19 Pegasus 2193 touched down, but failed to come to a complete stop on the runway. It overran and went down an embankment, breaking in three. The aircraft came to rest about 30 m below runway elevation. Data from flight tracking website Flightradar24 suggest that the aircraft was steered to the left at the end of the runway, likely as there was an antenna array just past the stopway. The last recorded ground speed was 63 knots as the aircraft crossed the perimeter road. Runway 06 is a concrete runway with a Landing Distance Available (LDA) of 3000 m. At the runway end there is a 65 m long stopway, followed by antenna array, perimeter road and a downslope. In March 2020 Turkish media reported on a preliminary report, issued by authorities. According to this report the aircraft was struck by lightning six minutes before landing. During the approach one of the preceding aircraft reported a sudden tailwind of 37 knots below 600 feet. This report was communicated in Turkish by the Tower controller. The Dutch first officer, who was Pilot Monitoring, did not understand this. Subsequent clearances and weather information were in English. After touchdown the speedbrake and autobrake activated. The thrust reversers were selected manually. After passing taxiway F at an airspeed of 57 knots, the speed brake and thrust reverser were switched off. The ground speed was reported to be 84 knots due to the effect of the wind. Six seconds later manual braking was resumed. The aircraft failed to stop on the runway, hit ILS antennas and a small building before it fell 30 m down the embankment.METAR: 14:50 UTC / 17:50 local time: LTFJ 051450Z VRB08G18KT 9999 -SHRA FEW025CB BKN036 BKN070 12/09 Q0990 NOSIG RMK RWY24 04009KT15:20 UTC / 18:20 local time: LTFJ 051520Z 29022G37KT 240V330 7000 -TSRA FEW017CB BKN025 BKN070 11/09 Q0992 RESHRA NOSIG RMK RWY24 33010G20KT 270V360 Sources: CNN TÃ¼rk  Airporthaber  Luchtvaartnieuws.nl   Location  Images: photo (c) Anna Zvereva; Istanbul-AtatÃ¼rk Airport (ISL/LTBA); 27 September 2018; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) Miklos Szabo; Istanbul-AtatÃ¼rk Airport (ISL/LTBA); 19 June 2018; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates17-Oct-2024 17:30 ASN Updated [Cn, ]02-Jan-2025 10:58 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Of the 73 passengers and crew onboard, one flight attendant received serious injuries and there were 22 minor injuries. The airplane sustained minor damage. The regularly scheduled domestic passenger flight was operating under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 from Charlotte Douglas International Airport (KCLT), Charlotte, North Carolina, to KTYS. The accident flight departed 4 hours late due to the late arrival of the inbound airplane in KCLT because of persistent severe weather that had been in the area. According to the flight crew, they kept the seatbelt sign illuminated for the entire flight because of the late night and weather in the area. They indicated that the takeoff, climb, and cruise were uneventful. Most of the flight was conducted at flight level (FL) 220 in clear air, with clouds beneath.  As they approached KTYS, the flight was cleared to descend at pilot's discretion to 13,000 feet. During the descent, the onboard radar was on but did not depict any precipitation in the cloud layer below them. In the early stages of the descent, the flight began entering and exiting various cloud layers and experienced very light/intermittent chop. At about FL 185, the flight went into a cloud and encountered severe turbulence, causing the autopilot to disengage and the airplane pitched nose down rapidly. The pilot flying reduced power, leveled the wings, and the airplane quickly exited the clouds into visual meteorological (VMC) conditions again. The flight continued to experience moderate turbulence during the descent.  The captain called back to check on the flight attendants (FA) and passengers but initially received no reply. A short time later, the captain called back again and was informed by a dead-heading flight attendant (FA) that both FAs had been injured.  At the time of the turbulence encounter, the forward FA was preparing the galley for landing and was thrown to the ceiling and back to the floor, injuring both ankles. The FA could not stand, and a dead-heading pilot helped her to a passenger seat.  The aft FA was conducting final compliance checks in the cabin and was also thrown to the ceiling and back to the floor, causing her to black out for a short time. Multiple passengers received various injuries, that included head bumps/bruises, scrapes, and anxiety issues. Two dead-heading FAs assumed the duties of the two injured FAs for the remainder of the flight. After landing, paramedics met the airplane at the gate and the two FAs and several passengers were transported to the hospital.  The forward FA was diagnosed with fractures in both ankles. Post accident examination of the weather data determined that the turbulence encounter occurred in a strong sheared environment with a 155-knot jet stream. There were several pilot reports (PIREPs) of moderate to severe turbulence in the area, and there was a National Weather Service SIGMET current for severe turbulence in the area. Probable Cause: An encounter with severe convective turbulence associated with a strong sheared environment associated with the jet stream.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA20CA071 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA20CA071  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

There were no injuries among the 166 passengers. The captain on the flight from Berlin Tegel Airport was the Pilot Flying (PF). The flight had been uneventful, although the flight crew was aware of unfavourable weather conditions in Keflavik with winds around 40 knots, gusting to 53-56 knots. Flight 529 was cleared direct to NONBO by Keflavik Approach. The captain briefed his intentions to land a bit further down the runway than normal (3 white and 1 red on the PAPI), to avoid turbulence on short final. When the airplane reached NONBO, it intercepted the localizer and the ILS was followed down towards runway 10. The airplane encountered considerable turbulence at 1000 feet above MSL. The autopilot was disengaged between 600 and 700 feet above MSL and the airplane was then manually flown down towards the runway. The airplane was flown with the nose into the wind on final approach due to crosswind conditions. Few seconds before touchdown the airplane was de-crabbed to line up with the runway heading. The flare was normal and the airplane initially touched down on its right main landing gear. Then the left main landing gear touched the runway. Almost immediately thereafter, as the nose was gradually coming down, abnormal sound was observed and the right side of the airplane sunk down. The airplane speedbrake deployed momentarily and the right engine hit the runway. The airplane then leveled off again and the nose landing gear touched the runway. The airplane wobbled as it continued down the runway, on the left main landing gear and the nose landing gear only, as the PF fought to keep the airplane level and centered on the runway, utilizing the aileron and rudder controls. As the airplane speed decreased, the aerodynamics of the wings and the effectiveness of the rudder and aileron control diminished, until the PF could no longer keep the airplane wings level. The right wing sunk down again and the right engine hit the runway again. The airplane skid on the runway until it came to stop, still on the runway but with a magnetic heading of 115Â°.  During the on-site investigation it became clear that the nut used to fasten the swivel in the lug position on the main landing gear shock strut was missing along with its mating washer-splined. These parts were found on the runway where the touchdown occurred. Further investigation showed that the swivel threads were undersized 1/16 inch during an overhaul in December 2008. The SWIVEL threads were then undersized again during an overhaul in November 2019, bringing it to 1/8 inch undersize. Such an undersize was allowed but required a special 1/8 undersized nut to be fabricated and used. However, the nut on TF-FIA was found to be too large.METAR: 15:00 UTC / 15:00 local time: BIKF 071500Z 13040G53KT 5000 -DZRA BR OVC010 07/06 Q096815:30 UTC / 15:30 local time: BIKF 071530Z 13042G56KT 6000 BR OVC013 07/06 Q096716:00 UTC / 16:00 local time: BIKF 071600Z 13042G55KT 8000 BR OVC013 07/06 Q0966Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: RNSA Report number: 20-014F001 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: ruv.is  visir.is  mbl.is History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  7 April 2015 TF-FIA Icelandair FlugfÃ©lag Islands 0 ReykjavÃ­k-KeflavÃ­k International Airport (KEF) min Lightningstrike Location  Images: photo (c) Harro Ranter / ASN; Billund Airport (BLL/EKBI); 07 May 2011 photo (c) Miklos Szabo; KeflavÃ­k International Airport (KEF/BIKF); 06 May 2017 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All four occupants were fatally injured.  According to flight plan information, the accident flight was scheduled to depart at 09:30 from Atlanta-Peachtree Airport and arrive at Nashville-John C. Tune Airport, Tennessee around 10:22. Then, another flight plan was filed back to Peachtree Airport departing at 10:30 and arriving around 11:19. In addition, the flight plan noted in the remarks section that the flight was a ""training flight."" The pilot in command, seated in the right seat, among others held a flight instructor certificate. He was also type rated in the Cessna 500.  The second in command, seated in the left seat, held a private pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single-engine land and instrument airplane. The pilot was scheduled to attend flight training to obtain a Cessna 500 type rating. After departure the controller issued local weather information and instructed the pilots to climb to 7,000 ft mean sea level (msl). The controller issued the pilots a pilot report (PIREP) for trace to light rime icing between 9,000 ft and 11,000 ft, and one of the pilots acknowledged. Then, the controller instructed the pilots to climb to 10,000 ft and to turn right to 020Â°. The controller observed the airplane on a northwest bound heading and asked the pilots to verify their heading. A pilot responded that they were returning to a 320Â° heading, to which the controller instructed him to maintain 10,000 ft. The controller asked the pilots if everything was alright, and a pilot responded that they had a problem with the autopilot. The controller instructed the pilots to again maintain 10,000 ft and to advise when they were able to accept a turn. The controller again asked if everything was alright or if they needed assistance; however, neither pilot responded. The controller again asked the pilots if everything was under control and if they required assistance, to which one of the pilots replied that they were ""OK now."" The airplane climbed to 10,500 ft and the controller instructed the pilots to maintain 10,000 ft and again asked if everything was under control. A pilot responded in the affirmative and stated that they were ""playing with the autopilot"" because they were having trouble with it, and the controller suggested that they turn off the autopilot and hand-fly the airplane. The airplane descended to 9,000 ft and the controller instructed the pilots to maintain 10,000 ft and asked them if they could return to the departure airport to resolve the issues. One of the pilots requested a higher altitude to get into visual flight rules (VFR) conditions, and the controller instructed him to climb to 12,000 ft, advised that other aircraft reported still being in the clouds at 17,000 ft, and asked their intentions. The pilot requested to continue to their destination and the controller instructed him to climb to 13,000 ft. One of the pilots established communication with another controller at 11,500 ft and stated they were climbing to 13,000 ft on a 360Â° heading. The controller instructed the pilot to climb to 16,000 ft and inquired if their navigation issues were corrected. A pilot advised the controller that they had problems with the left side attitude indicator and that they were working off the right side. The controller cleared the airplane direct to the destination airport and asked if they were above the clouds as they were climbing through 15,400 ft. The airplane then began a left turn and soon after radar contact was lost at 10:13.  The main wreckage of the airplane was located around 1330 on the day of the accident. It came to rest in a wooded area, inverted, and partially submerged in a creek at an elevation of 703 ft mean sea level. Several parts of the airplane were not located in the vicinity of the main wreckage but were in the wooded area surrounding the main wreckage, consistent with an inflight breakup. The debris path was about 7,000 ft long on a 005Â° heading. Probable Cause: The pilotsÂ loss of control in flight in freezing instrument meteorological conditions due to spatial disorientation and the cumulative effects of task saturation.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA20FA096 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: FAA  Flightaware tracklog  WSBTV   Location  Images: photo (c) Niall Moran; unknown; 18 April 2017; (CC:by-nc-sa) photo (c) Brian Gore; Atlanta-DeKalb Peachtree Airport, GA (PDK/KPDK); 08 October 2015 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All occupants evacuated the aircraft safely. The accident with the Boeing 737-500 VQ-BPS aircraft occurred during the landing as a result of a collision of the aircraft with a snow parapet 1.1 m high at a distance of 32 m to the runway threshold (within the paved section of the runway), which resulted in damage to the main landing gear and their subsequent ""folding"" in the process of moving along the runway. The accident was caused by a combination of the following factors: - the presence of contradictions in the Federal Aviation Rules for flights in the airspace of the Russian Federation, the airline's radio control system and the aircraft operational documentation regarding the need and procedure for introducing temperature corrections to the readings of barometric altimeters at low ambient temperatures; - Failure by the operator of the Usinsk aerodrome to comply with the FAP-262 requirements for the maintenance of the aerodrome, which resulted in the presence of snow parapets on the paved section of the landing strip; - the operator of the Usinsk aerodrome did not eliminate the shortcomings in the winter maintenance of the aerodrome, noted based on the results of the inspection by the Rosaviatsia commission on January 22, 2020; - lack of risk assessment in the airline associated with the execution of approaches in the baro-VNAV mode in the presence of factors that impede such approaches (low ambient temperatures, snow-covered underlying surface, drifting snow (snowstorm), significant changes in the relief in front of the runway end, lack of PAPI-type lights), as well as appropriate recommendations to the crews on the specifics of such approaches, including after the transition to visual flight, and crew training; - insufficient assessment by the crew during the preparation of the existing threats (hazard factors) and making an insufficiently substantiated decision to perform an RNAV (GNSS) approach (under the control of the autopilot in LNAV/VNAV mode) without introducing a correction for low outside air temperature in altitude overflying waypoints, which led to a flight below the established glide path; - performing a flight along the ""extended glide path"" after turning off the autopilot and switching to manual piloting without attempting to enter the set glide path; - the PIC may have had a visual illusion of a ""high glide path"" due to a snow-covered underlying surface, a snowstorm and the presence of a ravine directly in front of the runway end in the absence of PAPI type lights, which led to an incorrect assessment of the aircraft's flight altitude after switching to manual piloting, lack of reaction to timely and correct warnings of the co-pilot and exit to the runway end at a height significantly less than the established one.METAR: 05:30 UTC / 08:30 local time: METAR UUYS 090530Z 17006MPS 9000 Â SG OVC007 M24/M26 Q1003 R13/490534 NOSIG RMK QFE744/0993=Wind 170 at 6 mps; 9000 m visibility, 700 ft overcast, temperature: -24Â°C09:10 UTC / 12:10 local time: SPECI UUYS 090910Z 17006G11MPS 1500 SN BLSN BKN015 M21/M23 Q0999 R13/390238 TEMPO 1000 SN BLSN RMK QFE741/0989=Wind 170 at 6, gusting to 11 mps; 1500 m visibility in snow and blowing snow, broken clouds at 1500 ft, temperature: -21Â°CAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: Ren.tv   Location  Images: photo (c) MAK; Usinsk Airport (USK); 09 February 2020 photo (c) Anna Zvereva; Saint Petersburg-Pulkovo Airport (LED/ULLI); 10 September 2016; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot and the one passenger were not injured.  The airplane was climbing through flight level (FL) 225 for FL 380, when the pilot heard a ""loud crashing noise"" followed by a ""turbulent air sound"" he described as similar to flying with the main landing gear extended. At time of the initial noise, the pilot reported the airplane was on a heading of 255, the airspeed was about 265 to 270 kts, and the autopilot system was engaged. The autopilot system was set to lateral navigation and the vertical speed was set for 1,500 ft per minute for climbing.  The pilot reacted to the initial noise by disconnecting the autopilot system, announcing the issue to air traffic control (ATC), slowing down the airplane to 170 kts, and descending to 11,000 ft above mean sea level. There were no master caution or warning lights illuminated on the cockpit annunciation panel. The pilot initially thought the airplane had a main landing gear malfunction based of the sound of the airflow around the cabin. The pilot slowed the airplane further, cycled the main landing gear, cycled the flaps, and moved the flight controls. He reported everything checked out normal except the ""turbulent air sound"" which was exacerbated with rudder movement. The pilot decided the main landing gear was functioning normally and there was a problem with the empennage. The pilot located the closest airport with a paved runway greater than a 5,000 ft length, contacted ATC, and proceeded to land at the Mineral Wells Airport (MWL), Texas. The pilot executed an uneventful landing at 15:45 and shutdown the airplane without further incident.  A post landing inspection revealed the top and bottom cowling for the number 2 (right) engine were missing. A portion of the separated cowlings was found wrapped around the inboard section of the right horizontal stabilizer. A portion of the separated cowlings impacted the area between the leading edge of the vertical stabilizer and the top of the fuselage, resulting in substantial damage. The remaining pieces of the separated cowlings have not been recovered.  On-scene examination revealed that receptacle 29, at the forward inboard side of the lower cowl door, was missing its stud, snap ring, and grommet and that receptacles 26 and 28 were missing their grommets and snap rings but had retained their studs. The most likely cause of the cowl door departure is that either the stud at receptacle 29 was left unlocked when the cowl door was attached, or an oversized stud was used at receptacle 29 that was able to rotate from the locked to unlocked position. Without the stud to examine and additional on-wing testing, it cannot be determined whether the stud at that location was a longer grip-length stud or if spontaneous unlocking of a longer grip-length stud is an actual possibility. The reason for the separation of the cowlings could not be determined because the stud in question was not recovered. Probable Cause: The in-flight separation of the upper and lower right engine cowlings for reasons that could not be determined based on available evidence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN20LA082 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) FAA; Benbrook, TX; February 2020 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were 11 persons on board the aircraft; 2 pilots and 9 passengers. The pilot flying the aircraft was undergoing route and airstrip training. He was occupying the left seat and was Pilot Under Instruction (PUI). The pilot in the right seat was the instructor pilot for MAF conducting route and airstrip training for the new pilot. The pilot crossed overhead of the airstrip for an inspection of the surface and wind conditions. The crew did not observe any standing water or any wet areas on the strip. They also reported that the windsock indicated calm winds and the strip was clear. The aircraft joined mid-downwind less than half a nautical mile from the airstrip and tracked North West, descending from 1200 ft to 1000 ft before turning onto base. The aircraft began descending as it turned to line up on the final approach profile. There was a tailwind component of 5-12 kt on base and final. The aircraft overshot the turn onto final approach, 1.8 nm from the threshold at 900 ft. The pilot established the aircraft on the approach profile 1 nm from the threshold and at about 500 ft. The instructor stated that during final approach, the aircraft had descended below the normal approach profile causing him to instruct the pilot to adjust power and aim point to get back onto the correct profile. The pilot commenced the flare just under 20 ft AGL, 78 kt (85 kt ground speed). The aircraft touched down with an airspeed of 77 kt (82 kt ground speed) 36 m past the runway 11 threshold. The pilot stated that a few seconds after touchdown, he applied reverse thrust and the aircraft veered left. According to tyre track approximations, the aircraft appeared to have deviated about 220 m up-strip from threshold. The pilot stated that he applied full right rudder in an attempt to turn the aircraft back towards the center of the strip. The aircraft turned back to the right and rolled parallel to the centerline for another 100 m before it swerved left again, diverging at a 30Â° angle from the centerline. It rolled for 60 m as it bogged into the soft ground. The propeller blades subsequently struck the ground and the aircraft turned sharply left causing it to tip onto its starboard side. The crew reported that there were no injuries sustained during the accident and subsequent evacuation. Causes [Contributing factors] Onlanding,the PUI applied reverse thrust and the aircraft veered left of the centerline. Rudder was applied to get the aircraft back onto centerline, however, the rudder was not effective to counter the effect of reverse thrust as the left wheel entered in a softened area of the strip surface, which resulted in the aircraft being unable to regain the centerline as the landing roll progressed. The PUI did not effectively manage the effect of torque to maintain centerline during the landing roll.  The PUIÂs limited experience level on the aircraft type, low proficiency level in the use of reverse thrust during landing rolls, soft strip surface and soil condition were contributing factors of the accident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIC PNG Report number: AIC 20-1002 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: AIC PNG Media Release   Location  Images: photo (c) AIC PNG; Miyanmin Airstrip (MPX); February 2020 photo (c) AIC PNG; Miyanmin Airstrip (MPX); February 2020 photo (c) AIC PNG; Miyanmin Airstrip (MPX); February 2020 photo (c) AIC PNG; Miyanmin Airstrip (MPX); February 2020 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot and two passengers were fatally injured, and the airplane was destroyed. The airplane was registered to TLC Air, LLC and operated by Lauren Engineers & Constructors, Inc.  The airplane was cleared for takeoff from runway 35L at Abilene Regional Airport, Texas. Shortly afterwards the pilot was instructed to climb to 12,000 ft and was then cleared to climb to FL230. The pilot reported to the controller that they encountered freezing drizzle and light rime icing on the climb from 6,400 ft to 8,000 ft. As the airplane climbed through 11,600 ft, the pilot reported that they were having an issue with faulty deicing equipment and needed to return to the airport. The controller instructed the pilot to descend to 11,000 ft and cleared them direct to Abilene Airport. The flight was then instructed to descend to 7,000 ft and asked if there was an emergency. The pilot responded in the negative and stated that they blew a breaker when they encountered icing conditions, and that it was not resetting. The controller then instructed the pilot to descend to 5,000 ft and to expect the ILS runway 35R approach. The controller then instructed the pilot to turn to a heading of 310. Shortly afterwards the controller asked the pilot if they were turning to the assigned heading; the pilot responded that they were having issues with faulty instruments. When controller asked the aircraft to report their altitude, the pilot reported that they were at 4,700 ft. The controller then instructed the pilot to maintain 5,000 ft. The pilot responded he was ""pulling up"". There was no further communication with the pilot. Preliminary review of the airplane's radar track showed the airplane's departure from ABI and the subsequent turn and southeast track towards its destination. The track appeared as a straight line before a right turn was observed. The turn radius decreased before the flight track disappeared. The airplane impacted terrain in a right wing low attitude, followed by the right engine, then left engine. The wreckage path was on an initial heading of 320Â°, and continued for about 570 ft. The wreckage was highly fragmented and spread-out along the wreckage path. Probable Cause: ""The pilotÂs loss of airplane control due to spatial disorientation.

During the final descent into CYYC, the flight crew selected flaps 20 and immediately received a flaps fail caution message. The decision was made to abandon the approach, and the crew received clearance from ATC to proceed NW of the CYYC airport and troubleshoot the issue. The crew executed the applicable QRH procedure and subsequently received clearance from ATC to proceed with the landing. A flaps 0 landing was then executed. During the landing roll, after ground spoiler and thrust reverser deployment, the nose of the aircraft attained a significant nose high attitude. The rear fuselage of the aircraft struck the runway, and during the recovery, the nose landing gear subsequently impacted the runway. The aircraft taxied clear of the runway and to the intended parking area. Subsequent inspection revealed that the aircraft sustained significant structural damage to the forward fuselage and minor damage to the rear fuselage. There were no injuries. Findings as to causes and contributing factors 1. Moisture entered the flap flexible drive shaft casing, likely through the undetected puncture holes and the drive shaft casing to flap actuator interface, which led to the subsequent corrosion and failure of the inner drive shaft. 2. As the occurrence aircraftÂs actual annual utilization was approximately half of that expected by the manufacturer, the calendar time interval between maintenance inspections increased. As a result, the corrosion that developed was not detected because the shaft had not yet reached the 2400 flight-hour maintenance interval. 3. The Challenger 605 flight simulator used for recurrent training did not accurately represent the zero-flap handling characteristics of the aircraft when the thrust reversers are deployed, nor was it required for certification. As a result, the flight crew was inadequately prepared to prevent, or recover from, the nose pitch-up that occurred when the thrust reversers were deployed. 4. The pilot monitoring did not read the cautions included on the flaps fail checklist out loud to the pilot flying during the completion of the Quick Reference Handbook procedure. As a result, information critical to the safe operation of the aircraft was not brought to the pilot flyingÂs attention. 5. Insufficient pressure was applied to the control column to maintain the nose on the runway while using maximum reverse thrust; as a result, the nose pitched up, the aft fuselage contacted the runway, and the aircraft transitioned to a partial weight-off-wheels state. 6. When the left main wheel left the runway surface and the angle of attack reached 28.9Â°, the stick pusher activated and commanded a rapid nose-down pitch input. As a result of this rapid nose-down pitch, the forward section of the aircraft was damaged when the nose wheel contacted the runway.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A20W0016 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: TSB A20W0016   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight was conducted in accordance with the Visual Flight Rules (VFR). There were fifteen passengers, two pilots and one cabin crew onboard the aircraft. The accident occurred during landing on the water aerodrome at Kuredu Island Resort. At the time of the accident the water aerodrome was experiencing squally winds and rough seas under sunny conditions, common during the north east monsoon that is typical to the time of the year. The aircraft, while landing on one of the designated (but unmarked) water runways, touched down and bounced. After the bounce, the aircraft banked to the left dipping the left wing-tip into the water and the aircraft veered to the left. The right wing of the aircraft then abruptly dropped with the aircraft nose digging into the water. The captain attempted to initiate a go around after the bounce without success. During the accident the fuselage, wings, engines and propellers of the aircraft sustained substantial damage. Both the floats remained intact and the aircraft was upright after the accident. The aircraft taxied to the mooring buoy using the left engine power and assistance by a dinghy. All passengers and crew were able to evacuate safely. However, as a direct consequence of the accident, two of the operating crew and one passenger suffered minor injuries. Causes: Power was added on approach at around 100 to 150 ft. The aircraft bounced on touchdown which indicates probable skipping of the aircraft due to higher speed and with the prevailing sea conditions encountered a sudden big wave.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AICC Maldives Report number: 2020/01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: edition.mv History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  13 November 2021 8Q-MBC Trans Maldivian Airways 0 Kanifushi, Lhaviyani Atoll min Aborted takeoff Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

As the aircraft started the takeoff roll on runway 12, the aircraft directional control was lost and the aircraft exited the right side of the runway. The propellers subsequently contacted a snow bank and broke apart. Parts of the broken propellers penetrated the fuselage, injuring 1 passenger. The aircraft was substantially damaged. A similar accident occurred to a Skylink Charter Metro III on 29 September 2002. The aircraft, N343AE, veered off the runway on takeoff from Hawthorne Airport, California because one of the propellers was not out of the start lock. Findings as to causes and contributing factors 1. While the crew was carrying out the ""Before Taxi"" checklist, the ""Start Locks"" task was initiated; however, it was interrupted and not completed. 2. After the captain told the first officer to stand by, the crewÂs focus shifted to other tasks. It is likely that this slip of attention resulted in the power levers not being pulled over the flight idle gate to release the start locks. 3. The ""Before Taxi"" checklist did not contain a task to ensure that the start locks were removed and, as a result, the crew began taxiing unaware that the propellers were still on the locks. 4. After the engine was started or while the occurrence aircraft commenced taxiing for departure, it is likely that slight or rapid transient movements of the engine power levers, which were needed to taxi the aircraft, resulted in the release of the left propeller start locks while the right propeller start locks remained engaged. 5. As the power was advanced through 20%, the ""positive torque"" call required by standard operating procedures was not made, and the engine torque differential was not noticed by the crew. As a result, power lever advancement continued although the right engine torque/thrust remained near zero. 6. The engaged start locks on the right propeller prevented forward thrust, which resulted in a significant thrust differential. This differential thrust during the take-off roll resulted in a loss of directional control of the aircraft and, ultimately, a lateral runway excursion. 7. Following the runway excursion, the propellers, which were operating at a high rpm, shattered and splintered when they struck a frozen snowbank. 8. High-energy release of the nickel-cobalt erosion strips and splintered wood core debris from the propeller blades penetrated the reinforcement panel, fuselage skin and cabin wall, and resulted in serious injuries to a passenger sitting next to the penetrated cabin wallAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A20C0016 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: 29 Sept. 2002 Skylink Charter Metro III accident - same cause  TSB   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The captain was the Pilot Flying (PF) and the first officer was the Pilot Monitoring (PM). On board the aircraft were two additional passengers and a cargo of 16,645 kg.  At 07:48 local time, the controller issued takeoff clearance.  During takeoff roll, about 2 seconds after the PM called the aircraft speed of 80 knots, the pilots felt aircraft vibration, which became severe as the aircraft speed increased. When the aircraft speed was about 110 knots, the PF decided to reject the takeoff and felt that the aircraft direction could not be controlled and the braking was ineffective. The aircraft skidded longitudinally with the nose headed to the right. Thereafter, the aircraft veered to the right and continued until it went off the side of the runway. The aircraft was still moving on the right of the runway shoulder with the nose headed on the runway heading. After crossing taxiway D, the aircraft speed decreased while the aircraft was turning about 360 degrees. The aircraft stopped on the right runway shoulder about 1,600 meters from the beginning of runway 30 on heading 270Â°. Observing the runway condition, about 500 meters from the beginning runway 30, there was an oscillated wheel mark of both main landing gears and continued until the last position of the aircraft. An investigation of the landing gear showed the upper torsion link and lower torsion link of both main landing gears were separated. Both upper torsion links bent and twisted to the right. The left lower torsion link was fracture while the right lower torsion link broken. Also, both left and right main landing gear shimmy damper assemblies were broken and the shimmy damper manifold separated with the piston housing assembly.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSC Report number: KNKT.20.02.03.04 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: KNKT  Location  Images: photo (c) NTSC; Jayapura-Sentani Airport (DJJ); 25 February 2020 photo (c) NTSC; Jayapura-Sentani Airport (DJJ); 25 February 2020 photo (c) NTSC; Jayapura-Sentani Airport (DJJ); 25 February 2020 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates03-Dec-2024 11:00 ASN Updated [Source, Accident report, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were five crewmembers onboard comprising the captain, the copilot and the flight engineer on the flight deck, together with a loadmaster and an aircraft engineer who were seated in the galley area. The flight was uneventful and the Aircraft landed at 08:45 UTC at HSSJ. Prior to departure, after one hour and 35 minutes on the ground, the captain and the aircraft engineer completed the transit check. The captain noticed oil dripping from the lower fuselage. The aircraft engineer advised the captain that four days before the green hydraulic system tank had been replaced and that the oil was most likely residue from this maintenance action. He assured the captain that the aircraft would be cleaned on arrival in Sharjah. The aircraft departed HSSJ at 10:20 UTC for OMSJ. The departure and flight were uneventful until when at FL350 in the Muscat flight information region (FIR), the captain requested a flight level change due to moderate turbulence. According to his statement, immediately after starting the descent, he received a report from the flight engineer that the fluid level in the yellow hydraulic system had rapidly decreased and the ""HYDRAU"" light had illuminated on the master warning panel, followed by an autopilot disconnect.  The checklist items for the hydraulic system loss from the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) were followed and the flight continued manually with the captain as the pilot flying (PF). According to the captain, Air Traffic Control (ATC) was not informed of the hydraulic system loss, but that the flight crew prepared for an extended landing distance of 1.2 times the normal landing distance. The aircraft landed at 15:15 UTC at OMSJ on runway 30 and exited on the high-speed taxiway B7. The captain stated that the descent, approach, landing and taxiing to the cargo apron were uneventful, and that the brakes functioned normally. The captain followed the marshallerÂs instructions and stopped the aircraft at the assigned A300 position mark on parking stand 57, in front of the cargo hangar. The captain stated that once the aircraft came to a stop, he applied manual brakes and set the parking brake. While the crew started the parking checklist, the copilot prepared to shut the engines down. When the captain looked up, he realized that the aircraft was moving forward and he applied manual brakes but the aircraft did not stop. He stated that he then steered to the left to avoid the cargo hangar in front of the aircraft but the aircraft continued to move until the No.1 engine collided with a tug which was parked in the equipment area, approximately 36 meters beyond the A300 position mark. An inspection identified that the yellow hydraulic system high-pressure filter housing, located in the lower fuselage, had fractured and leaked hydraulic fluid. Causes The Air Accident Investigation Sector of the United Arab Emirates determines that the causes of the Aircraft collision with a parking tow tug and the consequent substantial damage were: (a) The uncontrolled movement of the Aircraft by engine idle thrust beyond the parking stop line. (b) The Aircraft could not be maintained at rest after the initial stop because the selected parking brake was not operational due to a leak from a fracture in the yellow hydraulic system high-pressure filter head, and a failure of the accumulator system of the parking brake that could not be determined during the Investigation. (c) The Aircraft could not be stopped by manual braking because that the ÂManualÂ brake was disabled after the flight crew selected the ÂParkingÂ brake without prior confirmation that adequate parking pressure was available. 3.4 Contributing Factors to the Accident The Investigation identified that the following were contributing factors to the Accident: (a) Airbus had identified the design of the high-pressure filter head as one of two contributors to fractures developing at the head flange, but did not address this issue with equal priority. (b) The marshaller was not prepared to place wheel chocks on the AircraftÂs arrival at the parking bay and was therefore unable to react timely to obstruct the movement of the Aircraft.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: GCAA Report number: AIFN/0006/2020 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) GCAA UAE; Sharjah Airport (SHJ); 28 February 2020 photo (c) GCAA UAE; Sharjah Airport (SHJ); 28 February 2020 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

After accomplishing air work, the pilots returned to the airport to practice landings and takeoffs. According to both pilots, the first approach was normal, and the airplane touched down slightly right of the runway centerline. The trainee pilot stated that, after touchdown, the airplane began drifting further right and that he was unable to correct the deviation. The trainer pilot reported that, when directional control became unstable, he told the trainee, ""I have the controls."" The trainer pilot saw that the trainee pilot released his hands from the engine power levers and the yoke, but the airplane continued to deviate to the right, contrary to his control inputs and his addition of asymmetric power to the engines. The trainer pilot realized that, based on his inputs, the airplane should have returned to the centerline but that it did not and that it was behaving as if the trainee pilot was applying some braking. At that point, the trainer pilot again told the trainee pilot to release the controls, and he used the brakes, which he reported applied and released normally. Subsequently, the airplane exited the right side of the runway and impacted a ditch. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing. The trainer pilot and the operator reported that there were no mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation. The trainer pilot reported that he believed the trainee pilot's feet were either on the brakes or interfered with his brake and/or rudder application attempts. The trainee pilot reported that he could not recall the position of his feet after he relinquished airplane control to the trainer pilot. Probable Cause: The trainee pilot's loss of directional control during landing and his subsequent unintentional control interference with the brakes and/or rudder during the trainer pilot's attempted remedial action, which resulted in a runway excursion and collision with a ditch.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: WPR20CA112 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  25 May 1999 N72GC Era Aviation 0 Anchorage, AK sub Bird strike Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Eisenhower National Airport (ICT/KICT) to Hays Municipal Airport (HYS/KHYS) crashed in wheat field terrain northwest of La Crosse, Rush County, Kansas. The aircraft took off from ICT at 07:52 local time (12:52 UTC). At 08:25, the HYS automated weather observation service was reporting, in part, winds from 080Â° at 11 knots, visibility 1 statute mile, and overcast clouds at 200 ft above ground level.  The pilot made an ILS approach to runway 34 but was forced to execute a missed approach. The pilot stated to ATC his intention to attempt the ILS approach to runway 34 a second time. At 08:41, the HYS weather indicated that visibility had dropped to 0,25 statute mile in fog. Again, the pilot performed a missed approach. About 08:59 the pilot stated his intention to divert to Great Bend Airport (GBD), Kansas. The airplane began a turn to the south toward GBD while climbing to about 7,000 ft.  Around 09:06, the pilot began making unintelligible radio communications that air traffic controllers stated were unreadable. About 09:15, the controller asked the accident pilot if he was turning directly to GBD. After an unintelligible response from the pilot, the controller stated Âalright plane master sixteen seventy it's very difficult to understand there might be something wrong with uh your cockpit or your pressurization plane master sixteen seventy oxygen oxygen.Â About a minute later, the pilot was more easily understood. However, about 09:18, ATC made a transmission with no response from the pilot. At the same time the airplane began a descent and left turn.  About 09:20, an unintelligible response was received from the accident airplane. ATC then made numerous transmissions to the accident pilot urging him to utilize oxygen and open a window. No further communications were received from the accident airplane. The aircraft was found to have crashed in a field. The airplane's tail and wings were visible above ground, with the forward fuselage and engine section buried several feet under the terrain, consistent with a near-vertical, high-speed impact. The main landing gear was bent aft towards the tail with the left and right main wheel protruding from the ground.

There were four persons on board; one pilot and three passengers. There were no reported injuries. During final approach into the Yenkisa Airstrip, the pilot was affected by the visual illusion presented by the upslope strip. As a result, the pilot flew too low during the final approach. The pilot stated that during the approach, as the aircraft got closer to strip 31, he realised that he was coming too close to a protruding tree along the approach path and determined that he was too low. He immediately shallowed the descent angle. Subsequent to clearing the tree, the pilot found himself high on approach, passing the strip 31 edge. The pilot steepened the descent angle because he realized that he had overshot the strip 31 edge. During flare, the aircraft floated for some distance due to the excess energy from the steep descent. The aircraft touched down about 200 m beyond the edge of strip 31. During the initial part of the landing roll, because the strip was wet, the aircraft subsequently skid forward. The pilot did not use reverse thrust during the landing roll. The aircraft overran the airstrip, hit a mound of clay and rocks, subsequently tipping left into a gully. The Yenkisa Airstrip is located at an elevation of 3700 ft. Airstrip 13/31 has a Landing Distance Available of 465 m. Landings can only be performed on runway 31 because the runway has a 8.7% down slope to the south-east. CAUSES [CONTRIBUTING FACTORS] There were trees protruding the approach OLS into Yenkisa Airstrip, close to the edge of strip 31. No effective action had been taken before the accident, to cut the trees protruding the approach OLS for Yenkisa Airstrip, following the survey conducted by RAA in which the obstacles were identified. At the time of the accident, the pilot did not properly manage the aircraft during the final approach and landing roll. During the final approach, the pilot was affected by a visual illusion due to the 8.7% upslope of Yenkisa Airstrip. The presence of trees penetrating the approach OLS was identified by the pilot after passing the committal point defined by MAF. The pilot was focused in clearing the obstacle, losing the aiming point. The final approach was not stabilised. During the flare, the aircraft travelled further than the expected touchdown point. During landing, main landing gear wheels were most likely locked causing the aircraft to skid.

The flight crew reported that the winds were from 040 degrees at 8 knots (slight tailwind), visibility greater than ten miles, and a thin layer of broken clouds at 17,000 feet.  The captain conducted an approach briefing and the first officer conducted a Landing Distance Assessment to account for the slight tailwind. The first officer reported the approach was normal and stabilized, and they encountered a slight downdraft in the flare. The captain disconnected the autopilot at about 400 feet above the ground and the autothrottle at 200 feet. Flight data recorder data indicated that the pitch attitude was about 7 degrees at touchdown but, as the ground spoilers deployed, pitch attitude increased to 10.9 degrees. There was a 3 to 5 knot crosswind at touchdown.  Post-flight inspection of the airplane indicated the underside of the rear fuselage struck the runway, resulting in damage to the skin, frames, and aft pressure bulkhead.

The crew flew a maximum effort (assault) landing at Ramstein Air Base and experienced a hard landing with a vertical acceleration load factor (g-load) exceedance value of 3.62 times the force of gravity (g) and a landing sink rate of 834 feet per minute exceeding the  aircraftÂs maximum allowable landing limits of 540 fpm and g-load of 2.0g. Immediately upon touchdown, the crew executed a go-around and coordinated with Air Traffic Control for a visual approach, full-stop landing. The aircraft landed safely at 17:37. The landing g-load exceedance resulted in significant damage to the center wing, both outer wings, left and right main landing gear assemblies, and engines, to include mounting structures. The estimated damages are $20,917,089. The crew of this mission was scheduled to fly in a formation of three C-130JÂs planning to conduct two training routes. The primary training objective for the local sortie was to complete the pilotÂs evaluation. The crew planned to takeoff early as a single-ship, conduct a maximum effort takeoff followed by a maximum effort landing using the painted landing zone marked on the runway as required for the evaluation, full-stop, and then rejoin the formation in order to complete the remainder of the evaluation requirements in the formation. Preflight, engine start, taxi and the Ramstein AB visual traffic pattern procedures were executed within good flying standards and were procedurally correct. The mishap occurred during the maximum effort landing. The Accident Investigation Board President found, by a preponderance of the evidence, the cause of this mishap was the pilot's early engine power reduction (power pull), beginning at 70 feet above ground level (AGL) and fully flight idle at 45 feet AGL. In addition, the board president found, by the preponderance of evidence, that the evaluated pilot and other pilotÂs failure to identify the excessive sink rate and their failure to arrest the excessive sink rate or go-around in a timely manner were substantially contributing factors that resulted in the aircraft exceeding the C-130J-30 g-load and sink rate landing limits.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: USAF AIB Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) USAF AIB; Ramstein AFB (RMS); April 2020 photo (c) USAF AIB; Ramstein AFB (RMS); April 2020 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

The airline transport pilot, commercial copilot, and one passenger were not injured.  The pilot reported that he was conducting a takeoff on runway 27 with the intended destination of Caracas-SimÃ³n BolÃ­var International Airport, Venezuela. During the takeoff roll, at rotation speed, the airplane did not respond when the pilot pulled back on the control yoke. He tried to rotate again, and the airspeed was in excess of V1, about 130 knots. With no response, he performed a rejected takeoff with maximum braking and full reverse thrust. The airplane departed the end of runway 27, proceeded through the overrun, and into the grass beyond the runway. The airplane pivoted to the left and came to a stop in the grass, near the perimeter access road. The crew and passengers exited the airplane and were met by first responders. The nose and right main landing gear collapsed during the accident sequence and the airplane sustained substantial damage to the forward fuselage and right wing.

At 12:16, the aircraft departed Cambridge Bay Airport for Kugaaruk (CYBB). The first officer was the pilot flying. At 13:19, when the flight was about 80 nautical miles from CYBB at flight level 210, the flight crew called the CYBB community aerodrome radio station. The flight crew received the runway surface condition report and were informed that the winds were from 200Â° true, at 24 knots gusting to 33 knots. At 13:20, the community aerodrome radio station operator called the flight crew and relayed the CYBB 1300 weather observation, reporting that the horizontal visibility was 1/4 statute mile in light snow and blowing snow and that the vertical visibility was 400 feet. The flight crew noted that the visibility had decreased since their departure from Cambridge Bay but continued the approach. The reported wind would result in a 12-to 16-knot crosswind component from the left on runway 23. The captain took control at 13:27, at the start of the descent, and descent checks were carried out. The captain transferred control back to the first officer at the initial approach waypoint, DATLA, and briefed for a pilot-monitored area navigation (RNAV) approach to runway 23. From the intermediate approach waypoint to the missed approach waypoint the approach is flown on a track of 244Â°T, which is offset 15Â° from the runway heading of 229Â°T. When the runway is acquired visually at or before the minimum descent altitude (MDA), a left turn is required to align the aircraft with the runway heading. During the descent the flight crew activated the runway lights and the precision approach path indicator (PAPI) system via the aircraft radio control of airport lighting system (ARCAL). The captain set the flaps to the approach setting (40%), and the first officer flew the descent. When the captain then confirmed visual contact with the runway, snow was blowing across it at an angle from left to right. The runway itself was apparent as a black shape within the blowing snow; however, the runway lighting and PAPI were not observed. The captain set the flaps to the land setting (100%) and then, as part of the pilot-monitored approach procedure, assumed control of the aircraft as the pilot flying. The first officer looked up from the instruments and observed, through the blowing snow, the runway as well as the community aerodrome radio station and airport apron ahead and off to the left. The aircraft crossed the runway threshold at 100 knots indicated airspeed. As the captain flared the aircraft, the first officer warned the captain of snowbanks off to the right side of the runway. At 13:50, when the right main landing gear touched down, the aircraft veered to the right and departed the runway surface. The right wing contacted snowbanks and the aircraft turned approximately 90Â° to the right before colliding nose first with a high snowbank. Both crew members, who were not injured, exited through the cabin door. The aircraft was substantially damaged; however, the freight remained secure. The emergency locator transmitter (ELT) did not activate and there was no fire. Findings as to causes and contributing factors 1. Approaches to airports north of 60Â°N latitude are not restricted by ground visibility and, as a result, the flight crew continued the approach when the reported visibility was Â¼ statute mile, which is lower than the published advisory visibility of 1Â¾ statute miles for this approach. 2. The flight crew believed that the lack of an approach ban permitted a landing, and landed at Kugaaruk Airport even though the reported ground visibility was below the minimum aerodrome operating visibility. 3. The offset approach, the crosswind component from the left, and the moving-runway illusion created by the blowing snow, all contributed to the aircraftÂs alignment with the right side of the runway. 4. The aircraft touched down near the right edge of the runway and, when the right landing gear impacted the deeper snow along the runway edge, the aircraft veered to the right and departed the runway surface. 5. The snow depth adjacent to the runway was allowed to exceed the limits dictated by the airport operatorÂs Winter Maintenance Plan. Consequently, the aircraft sustained additional damage when it departed the runway surface.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A20C0037 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources: CBC  TSB A20C0037   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot sustained no injury.  The flight departed the Corpus Christi International Airport (CRP), Texas, at 20:04 with 631 lbs of cargo and a fuel load of 2,800 lbs. During the initial climb, the captain selected the landing gear handle to the UP position to retract the landing gear. The attempt was unsuccessful, and the captain attempted to cycle the landing gear handle once more yielding the same result. Following the second unsuccessful gear retraction, the captain elected to leave the landing gear handle in the DOWN position and continued to the San Antonio International Airport (SAT), Texas, where more services would be available if needed. The airplane climbed to 8,000 ft mean sea level and cruised below the maximum landing gear extended speed (VLE). As the captain began to prepare for arrival at SAT, he retrieved the arrival automatic terminal information service (ATIS). The ATIS was reporting gusting winds out of the north, clear skies, and runway 4 as the active arrival runway. The captain began the descent toward the airport and air traffic control cleared the airplane for the visual approach to runway 4. The pilot entered a dogleg right base and completed the before landing checklist noting three green lights and no red lights, which indicated the landing gear was down, locked, and safe for landing. The airplane touched down around the aiming point marker on runway 4. As the main landing gear touched down on the dry concrete, the left main landing gear collapsed, the red unsafe light in the landing gear handle illuminated, and was followed by an aural horn indicating the landing gear was now unlocked and unsafe for landing. Simultaneously, the airplane began to dip toward the left, causing the left wing tip to contact the runway. The impact on the airplane resulted in the airplane's momentum taking the airplane from the runway centerline off the runway and into the grass area several thousand ft from the runway 4 threshold. Once the airplane came to a complete stop, the captain shutdown all power to the airplane and exited through the main entry air stairs. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing. A postaccident damage assessment by the operator revealed that the left main landing gear brace was fractured. Probable Cause: The failure of the left main landing gear upper drag leg arm due to substandard mechanical properties, which resulted in a collapse of the landing gear upon landing.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN20LA175 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) FAA; San Antonio International Airport, TX (SAT); 11 May 2020; (publicdomain) photo (c) FAA; San Antonio International Airport, TX (SAT); 11 May 2020; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Al 167 passengers and nine crew members on board were killed. The Boeing 737-800, registration UR-PSR, had landed on schedule at 00:57 hours local time at Tehran. The return leg back to Kiev was due to depart at 05:15 local time (01:45 UTC).  In the meantime, around 02:15 hours local time in Iran, numerous ballistic missiles were fired from Iran towards U.S. bases in Iraq in response to the killing of Major General Qasem Soleimani by a United States drone strike. As a result this military operation changed the alertness level of Iran's air defense. At approximately 04:00 the military sector informed the civil sector of the country's Airspace Control that only the flights already detected and cleared for flight operations by the defense network could be permitted to start up. This would ensure the correct identification of civil flights by the defense network and avoiding targeting them by mistake. At 05:49 the doors were closed and the aircraft was ready to depart. Two minutes later the flight requested the to start up the engines. After contacting the Area Control Center, the ATC unit requested clearance for the Ukrainian flight at 05:52. The Area Control Center forwarded the request for flight PS752 to the Air Defense Coordination Center, which subsequently issued the clearance accordingly. The aircraft then taxied to runway 29R and commenced the takeoff roll at 06:11. After takeoff the flight contacted Mehrabad Radar and was cleared to climb to FL260 and turn right after reaching 6000 feet, heading direct to the PAROT reporting point. As the aircraft was climbing after departure, it appeared on the air defense system. However, a wrong initialisation procedure of the system's north alignment had induced a 107-degree error in the system. Thus, the direction of objects and targets detected by this system was being observed with an increase of 107 degrees by the operator. At 06:13:56, the air defense unit operator detected a target at his 250-degree azimuth, flying on a 52-degree course. At the same time, PS752 had been flying towards the defense system from a 143-degree azimuth. The aircraft was flying a 309-degree course. At 06:14:21, the operator notified the specifications of the detected target to the Coordination Center over the communication network.  The notification was not communicated successfully. Meanwhile the system operator began analyzing the observable information and categorized the detected target as a threat. At 06:14:41, without receiving any response from the Coordination Center, the air defense unit operator fired a missile at the threatening target he had detected.  Under the applicable procedures, if the defense system operator cannot establish communication with the Coordination Center and does not receive the fire command, they are not authorized to fire.  The missile radio fuse was activated at 06:14:59. At that point flight PS752 was at 8100 feet at a position about 20 km west-northwest of the airport. After the first missile radio fuse was activated, the air defense unit radar still locked on the target, and the defense system kept detecting and tracking it. By observing the continuity of trajectory of detected target, the second missile was fired at the aircraft by the operator of defense system at 06:15:11. At 06:45:24, the last communication between the missile and the defense system was recorded in a place close to the aircraft route. After that, the defense system showed a message indicating the strike had failed, with the aircraft clearing from the radar lock-on after some time. The aircraft turned to the right and about 06:16:11, a fire broke out on the aircraft, which was intensifying. Altitude was lost and at 06:18:23, the aircraft crashed into a playground in Khalajabad near Shahedshahr area, 15 km north of the airport. It disintegrated completely and wreckage was strewn along a 300 m long path. Cause of the Accident The air defense's launching two surface-to-air missiles at the flight PS752, UR-PSR aircraft the detonation of the first missile warhead in proximity of the aircraft caused damage to the aircraft systems and the intensification of damage led the aircraft to crash into the ground and explode instantly. Other Contributing Factors - The mitigating measures and defense layers in risk management proved to be ineffective due to the occurrence of an unanticipated error in threat identifications, and ultimately failed to protect the flight safety against the threats caused by the alertness of defense forces.METAR: 02:44 UTC /  local time: OIIE 080200Z 28006KT CAVOK M01 / M04 Q1021Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Iran Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: TSB response to accident report  Ukraine Flight 752: New Video Shows First Missile Hit Plane (NY Times, 14 Jan. 2020)   Location  Images: photo (c) FARS News Agency; near Sabashahr; 08 January 2020; (CC:by) photo (c) FARS News Agency; near Sabashahr; 08 January 2020; (CC:by) photo (c) FARS News Agency, Hossein Mersadi; near Sabashahr; 08 January 2020; (CC:by) photo (c) FARS News Agency, Hossein Mersadi; near Sabashahr; 08 January 2020; (CC:by) photo (c) FARS News Agency, Hossein Mersadi; near Sabashahr; 08 January 2020; (CC:by) photo (c) FARS News Agency, Hossein Mersadi; near Sabashahr; 08 January 2020; (CC:by) photo (c) FARS News Agency, Hossein Mersadi; near Sabashahr; 08 January 2020; (CC:by) photo (c) FARS News Agency, Hossein Mersadi; near Sabashahr; 08 January 2020; (CC:by) photo (c) FARS News Agency, Hossein Mersadi; near Sabashahr; 08 January 2020; (CC:by) photo (c) CAO Iran; near Sabashahr; 08 January 2020 photo (c) Gilles Brion; GenÃ¨ve-Cointrin Airport (GVA/LSGG); 23 April 2017 photo (c) Arno Janssen; Jetfotos.de; DÃ¼sseldorf International Airport (DUS/EDDL); 25 March 2018 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates09-Oct-2024 13:55 ASN Updated [Destination airport, Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Of the 159 passengers and crew onboard, one flight attendant sustained serious injuries.  The airplane was not damaged. The flight was operating under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 as a regularly scheduled passenger flight from the KMSY to Newark Liberty International Airport (KEWR), Newark, New Jersey.   According to the flight crew, they advised the flight attendants (FA) to expect some light turbulence during the climb out, and stated they would leave the seatbelt sign illuminated for passengers until they had reached smooth air.  During the climb to their assigned altitude of flight level (FL) 370, the weather radar was active and air traffic control advised of weather directly in front of the flight.  As the flight was climbing through about FL 305 , the flight was in clear air but the crew realized they were not going to stay above the clouds ahead of the airplane and requested, and were approved, to deviate to the right to avoid the buildups.  During the turn, the captain made an announcement on the public address (PA) system for the FAs to 'take their jumpseatsâ and subsequently encountered 'a couple bumps of light chop.â  Almost immediately after, they received a call from the cabin, that the purser had been injured.   According to the FAs, they were preparing for cabin service when the turbulence was encountered. The forward FA fell to the floor as she was walking through the first-class cabin.  Subsequently, the flight crew's announcement for the 'flight attendants take your jump seatsâ came over the PA system.  The injured FA was assisted by medically qualified passengers and remained in a passenger seat for the remainder of the flight. Paramedics met the airplane at the gate and the FA was transported to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a fractured ankle. Post accident examination of the weather data determined that the turbulence was encountered when the airplane was flying over an area of general thunderstorms.  Cloud tops up to FL400 were located within 10 miles of the turbulence encounter but there were no pilot reports (PIREPs) in the vicinity indicating turbulence prior to the event.  There was a Center Weather Advisory current for the area for isolated thunderstorms, which was included in the flights weather briefing. Probable Cause: an encounter with convectively induced turbulence while overflying an area of known convective activity.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA20CA058 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA20CA058 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  22 March 2023 N1902U United Airlines 0 Houston-George Bush Intercontinental Airport, TX (IAH/KIAH) sub Tailstrike Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

The aircraft operated on a service from Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport, Russia. The flight was cleared for an approach to runway 36C at Antalya Airport. During the base leg of the approach, the autopilot and autothrottle were disengaged. The aircraft was further configured for landing and the approach was stabled at 1035 feet altitude, 3 nm and from the runway. When descending below 270 feet (about 100ft agl) the airspeed decreased below the approach speed of 122 kt to a value to 109 at 20 feet above the runway. The pitch was 5.5Â° nose-up and idle thrust was selected. Then the captain abruptly moved the sidestick fully forward, holding it there for 1.5 seconds and causing the nose to drop. Full power was added and its nose-gear struck the runway with a 2.64g impact. The Airbus bounced and the captain pulled the sidestick to execute a go-around. The aircraftÂs flight-control system switched to direct law, two inertial reference systems failed, and attitude indications disappeared from the captainÂs instruments. Although the flaps were partially retracted during the go-around, the undercarriage could not be retracted. Smoke entered the cockpit and the flight declared a Mayday. Subsequently a low pass was made over runway 36C so the Tower could assess the damage to the aircraft. Then a dual hydraulic failure occurred, and the fight again declared a Mayday. A left-hand visual approach was flown to runway 36C and the aircraft landed. The runway was vacated and the aircraft was then shut down. The airline only notified the Russian Interstate Aviation Committee on January 14, four days after the accident. Investigators believes that after the accident both the voice recorder (CVR) as well as the flight data recorder (FDR) were removed by RMS Technic in Antalya. The voice recorder was fitted to a second Airbus A321 (VP-BHN) flying the return service to Moscow. After arrival in Moscow, it was removed by another maintenance firm and transported back to RMS Technic in Antalya where the recorder was refitted to the original damaged A321, before the inquiry team arrived. The investigation is ongoing.METAR: 04:04 UTC / 07:04 local time: LTAI 100404Z 36018G29KT CAVOK 07/M06 Q1018 NOSIG RMK RWY18C 36021KT RWY36R 35018G29KT RWY18L 35018G30KT04:20 UTC / 07:20 local time: LTAI 100420Z 01014KT CAVOK 07/M06 Q1019 NOSIG RMK RWY18C 01016G27KT RWY36R 36014G26KT RWY18L 36016KT04:50 UTC / 07:50 local time: LTAI 100450Z 02016G26KT CAVOK 07/M06 Q1019 NOSIG RMK RWY18C 03012KT RWY36R 36016KT RWY18L 02012KTAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: airporthaber.com  @AshedShadow   Location  Images: photo (c) MAK; Antalya Airport (AYT); January 2020 photo (c) MAK; Antalya Airport (AYT); January 2020 photo (c) MAK; Antalya Airport (AYT); January 2020 photo (c) Dmitrii Ermakov; Saint Petersburg-Pulkovo Airport (LED/ULLI); 19 May 2018 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

In the cockpit, the PIC was in the left pilotâs seat as Pilot Monitoring, a trainee in the FO promotion training in the right pilotâs seat as Pilot Flying and the FO was in the observer seat. When reaching an altitude of 10,000 ft during the climb, the flight crew members confirmed that there were no clouds on the climb route, and turned off the seat belt sign in the cabin around 13:12 JST. After that, the aircraft continued to climb to the cruising altitude of FL320. After the seat belt sign was turned off, based on the weather information confirmed prior to their departure, the PIC anticipated the possibility that they might encounter turbulence during the climb, thus he was thinking of how to respond, such as promptly turning on the seat belt sign to have the cabin crew members seated, when detecting a sign of turbulence. On the other hand, in the cabin, after the seat belt sign was turned off, cabin crew members started selling duty-free goods and distributing immigration cards. The senior cabin crew member moved to the aft galley to take care of passengers.  Until reaching an altitude of about FL 250 after the seat belt sign was turned off, the aircraft had neither entered clouds nor encountered turbulence, and any sign of turbulence was not confirmed on the airborne weather radar and other instrument indications. However, around 13:17 immediately after reaching FL 250, the aircraft was strongly shaken all of sudden, therefore the PIC turned on the seat belt sign at once. At this time, the PIC instructed the cabin crew members to be seated promptly. When this shaking occurred, the purser in the center of the aft galley was standing facing forward of the cabin, but fell down to the right not being able to support herself. Afterward, being seated in her seat located near the aft galley, the purser confirmed that she had pain in her right ankle and suffered abrasions.  Turbulence ceased after reaching FL 270, and the flight reported to Fukuoka Air Traffic Control that they encountered turbulence.  The PIC then judged that it would be possible to fly to Incheon International Airport, their destination. The purser was diagnosed with a lateral malleolus fracture in her right ankle in a hospital in Seoul City.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JTSB Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: JTSB  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates17-Jun-2024 10:54 ASN Updated [Category, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The Aircraft had 526 persons onboard, consisting of two flight crewmembers, 24 cabin crewmembers and 500 passengers. The commander, occupying the left seat, was the pilot flying (PF). He stated that prior to the turbulence encounter, the daylight flight was uneventful with no avoidance actions required due to weather. After entering BEIRA flight information region (FIR), Mozambique, at flight level (FL) FL400 close to waypoint OKBIM, the flight crew stated that there was light turbulence with the weather radar displaying that the weather was off-path on the navigation display (ND) and beneath the aircraft. Soon after, several magenta spots appeared on the weather radar along the flight path indicating that there were areas of wet turbulence within 40 nautical miles (NM) ahead of the aircraft. At 1314:24 UTC, approximately six hours after departure from OMDB, the aircraft experienced moderate to severe turbulence at FL400 within BEIRA FIR. The operational flight plan (OFP) significant aeronautical weather chart had forecast the occasional presence of convective weather activity containing embedded cumulonimbus clouds (CB) up to an altitude of 52,000 feet (ft) in this area. During the turbulence encounter, the Aircraft autopilot and autothrust remained engaged and there were no operational exceedances. The turbulence lasted for approximately 30 seconds and resulted in a serious leg injury to an unsecured passenger on the upper deck. There was no reported damage to the aircraft cabin. The commander decided to continue the flight to the destination as the passengerâs injury was non-life threatening and the aircraft performance was not affected. The remainder of the flight, lasting 1 hour 46 minutes, was uneventful. Causes The Air Accident Investigation Sector of the United Arab Emirates (AAIS) determines that the cause of the Accident was the severe turbulence of vertical gust forces imposed on the Aircraft as it operated within an area associated with wet turbulence cells, resulting in the forceful movement of unsecured passengers and cabin crewmembers. Contributing Factors The Investigation determines that the following were contributory factors to the Accident: (a) After entering BEIRA FIR and wet turbulence was detected by the weather radar turbulence function, the flight crew did not use the full capabilities of the weather radar to obtain an accurate assessment of the distance of the area of greatest threat from the Aircraft flight path. (b) There was insufficient time for the cabin crew to secure the cabin after the seat belt sign was turned ON.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: GCAA Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: GCAA Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

The airplane ended up 400 or 500 yards offshore in the waters of Unalaska Bay near Hog Island and sank. The three occupants were rescued. According to the pilot, after checking the weather on the Automated Weather Observing System (AWOS), he completed the before takeoff check list, back taxied for a runway 31 departure and initiated the takeoff roll. He said he recalled the winds being reported as 100Â° at 9 knots. As the airplane accelerated down the runway, he said the airspeed was about 75 knots at midfield and increasing. When the airspeed reached about 90 knots, he applied back pressure to the control yoke to initiate the takeoff and noted a brief positive rate of climb, followed by a sinking sensation. The airspeed rapidly decayed, and the stall warning horn sounded. In an effort to correct for the decaying airspeed, he lowered the nose and immediately noticed the airplane's lights reflecting off the surface of the water. He pulled back on the airplane's control yoke and leveled the wings just before impacting the ocean waters.  A tailwind takeoff was performed since IFR takeoff minimums and (obstacle) departure procedures only allow for night departures off of runway 31.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ANC20LA015 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: adn.com  kucb.org  Flightaware   Location  Images: photo (c) Bas Velders; Anchorage-Ted Stevens International Airport, AK (ANC/PANC); 07 April 2016 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft had departed MontrÃ©al-Pierre Elliott Trudeau Airport (CYUL) at 07:06 hours local time on a multi-stop flight to Salluit. The accident occurred on the second leg, from MontrÃ©al to Schefferville. Findings as to causes and contributing factors: 1. The pilots forgot to perform the descent checklist and realized this at an inopportune time, when the pilot monitoring was providing a position report. 2. Given the ambiguities and contradictions in the stabilized approach guidelines, the captain interpreted that he was allowed to continue the approach below 500 feet above aerodrome elevation although the flaps had not been set to 35Â° and the final checklist had not been completed. 3. Communicating with the flight attendant to confirm the cabin status and performing the descent checklist during final approach added to the pilotsÂ workload, which was already heavy. 4. The combination of the visual conditions and the plan continuation bias prompted the pilots to continue managing the height and speed deviations past the stabilized approach gate. 5. When the aircraft passed 500 feet above aerodrome elevation, the pilots, who were dealing with a heavy workload, passed the stabilized approach gate without noticing it and continued the approach, which was de facto unstable. 6. At the time of the flare, the aircraft no longer had enough energy to stop the rate of descent solely by increasing the pitch attitude. 7. The instinctive reaction to increase the pitch attitude, combined with the hard landing, resulted in the aft fuselage striking the runway, causing major damage to the aircraftÂs structure.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A20Q0013 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  9 February 2024 C-GXAI Air Inuit 0 Tasiujuaq Airport, QC (YTQ/CYTQ) min Collision with other aircraft on apron Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The three occupants were killed and the aircraft was destroyed. The Citation departed Port Elizabeth Airport (FAPE) on a positioning flight to George Airport (FAGG). On approach to FAGG, the flying crew requested to carry out a calibration flight for the very high frequency omnidirectional range (VOR) beacon at FAGG. Due to inclement weather conditions at the time, they were not cleared to conduct VOR calibration. As a result, they decided to land and refuel the aircraft before commencing with the calibration of the Instrument Landing System (ILS) on runway 11 at FAGG. The flying crew requested take-off from runway 11 and an early right turn to intercept radial 250Â°, 17 nautical miles (nm) DME arc to radial 330Â° at 3000 feet (ft) climbing to 4000ft. The air traffic control (ATC) granted their request. Radar data indicated that at 10:42, the aircraft took off from runway 11 and, once airborne, made a right-hand turn to intercept radial 250Â° using the George VOR (GRV VOR). The aircraft climbed to 3000ft. Once the aircraft reached 17nm on the DME from the GRV VOR (DME is co-located with the VOR), it commenced with a right-hand turn to intercept radial 330Â° while maintaining 17nm DME arc. At 10:46, the ATC at FAGG advised the flying crew that they were now exiting controlled airspace and were advised to broadcast on the special rules frequency. The crew acknowledged the advisory to change frequency and there was no further communication. The aircraft was still being monitored by ATC using secondary surveillance radar. At 10:50, radar data showed the aircraft crossing radial 310Â° and entered a climb from 3000ft, reaching 3900ft. As the aircraft levelled off at 3900ft, a rapid descent occurred, and the aircraft lost 1500ft in approximately 9 seconds. Three seconds prior to impact, the aircraft nose pitched up before impacting a ridge at 2192ft. Probable Cause: The crew lost control of the aircraft which resulted in significant loss of altitude; as they attempted to recover, they collided with the mountain. According to the SAWS report, there was significant cloud coverage below 1500 ft above ground level at the time of the accident as observed in the METARs. Mountain tops were obscured as seen on the Webcam. The aircraft route which is 17 N.M arc passes over the obscured mountains. From the limited FDR reading the aircraft attitude drastically changed into an unusual attitude when approaching the mountain area .This indicates that most probably, the pilot has entered into an unusual attitude during transition from VFR to IFR flight without preparation. The accident flight plan was VFR. Contributing Factors: 1. The presence of low clouds at about 1500ft below above ground and obscured mountains with clouds; 2. The incapability of the crew to recover from unusual attitude; lack of supervision and disregard of the Civil Aviation Regulations requirements by the FIU (operator). 3. Overbanked and steep dive maneuver, unable to gain the required altitude before impact; 4.

All three crew members died in the accident. The aircraft, contracted to the New South Wales Rural Fire Service, departed Richmond RAAF Base, Australia at 12:05 local time. The crew had been tasked with a fire retardant drop over the ÂAdaminaby ComplexÂ bush fire. After approaching the Adaminaby complex fire, the drop was unable to be completed and the aircraft was diverted to a secondary tasking, to drop retardant on the ÂGood GoodÂ fire. Witnesses reported seeing the aircraft complete a number of circuits, prior to completing the retardant drop. The drop was conducted on a heading of about 190Â°, at about 200 ft above ground level, with a drop time of approximately 2 seconds. The crew released about 1,200 US gallons (4,500 L) of fire retardant during the drop. Witness videos taken of the aircraft leading up to the accident showed a number of passes conducted at varying heights prior to the retardant drop. Following the retardant drop, the aircraft was observed to bank left, before becoming obscured by smoke after about 5 seconds. A further 15 seconds after this, the aircraft was seen flying at a very low height above the ground, in a left wing down attitude. Shortly after, at about 13:16, the aircraft collided with terrain and a post-impact fuel-fed fire ensued. The three crew were fatally injured and the aircraft was destroyed. Contributing factors: - Hazardous weather conditions were forecast and present at the drop site near Peak View, which included strong gusting winds and mountain wave activity, producing turbulence. These conditions were likely exacerbated by the fire and local terrain. - The Rural Fire Service continued the B134 tasking to Adaminaby when they learned that no other aircraft would continue to operate due to the environmental conditions. In addition, they relied on the pilot in command to assess the appropriateness of the tasking to Adaminaby without providing them all the available information to make an informed decision on flight safety. - The pilot in command of B134 accepted the Adaminaby fire-ground tasking, which was in an area of forecast mountain wave activity and severe turbulence. After assessing the conditions as unsuitable, the crew accepted an alternate tasking to continue to the Good Good (Peak View) fire-ground, which was subject to the same weather conditions. The acceptance of these taskings were consistent with company practices. - Following the partial retardant drop and left turn, the aircraft was very likely subjected to hazardous environmental conditions including low-level windshear and an increased tailwind component, which degraded the aircraftÂs climb performance. - While at a low height and airspeed, it was likely the aircraft aerodynamically stalled, leading to a collision with terrain. - Coulson Aviation's safety risk management processes did not adequately manage the risks associated with large air tanker operations. There were no operational risk assessments conducted or a risk register maintained. Further, as safety incident reports submitted were mainly related to maintenance issues, operational risks were less likely to be considered or monitored. Overall, this limited their ability to identify and implement mitigations to manage the risks associated with their aerial firefighting operations. (Safety issue) - Coulson Aviation did not provide a pre-flight risk assessment for their firefighting large air tanker crews. This would provide predefined criteria to ensure consistent and objective decision-making with accepting or rejecting tasks, including factors relating to crew, environment, aircraft and external pressures. (Safety issue) - The New South Wales Rural Fire Service had limited large air tanker policies and procedures for aerial supervision requirements and no procedures for deployment without aerial supervision. (Safety issue) - The New South Wales Rural Fire Service did not have a policy or procedures in place to manage task rejections, nor to communicate this information internally or to other pilots working in the same area of operation.

The landing reference speed (Vref) was 122 knots and touchdown occurred at the 1,000 ft markers. The thrust reversers were deployed until 70 knots. The pilot then noticed standing water on the runway, and as the airplane encountered the standing water, it yawed to the right and departed the runway. The airplane impacted a chain-link fence and sustained substantial damage to the right wing spar. The pilot further reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation. Weather observations at TJIG were reported only when the air traffic control tower was open (0700 to 1900), and there were no automated weather observation stations at the airport.

The aircraft, from 430th EECS, was outfitted with a Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) and operated as a communications-relay platform out of Kandahar Airport, Afghanistan. At the time of the accident the aircraft operated on a combat sortie as well as a Mission Qualification Training for the first officer. Takeoff occurred at 11:05 local time. The flight proceeded to the assigned orbit using standard departure/climb procedures. The crew assumed a circular orbit just west of Kabul at 42,000 feet altitude at about 11:36. At 12:50, the crew requested and was cleared by ATC to climb from 42,000 feet altitude to 43,000 feet altitude. The engine revolutions per minute (RPMs) advanced and the crew initiated the climb with the autopilot, gaining about 300 feet. At 12:50:52, a fan blade broke free and separated from the N1 first-stage turbofan of the left engine, causing major damage and resulting in the immediate shutdown of that engine by the Electronic Engine Controller (EEC), a subsystem of the Full Authority Digital Engine Controller (FADEC). This was accompanied by a bang. Simultaneous with the bang, the CVR recording stopped.  Within one to two seconds after the initial event, the autothrottles disengaged automatically. The autopilot was engaged and it remained engaged. Bank angles remained essentially constant, consistent with a circular orbit, and the aircraft descended from an altitude of 42,300 feet to 41,000 feet. Ten seconds after the catastrophic left engine failure, the crew retarded both throttles to just less than halfway (14 degrees; total throttle range is from 0 Â 40 degrees) for one second, then slightly advancing the left throttle separately (26 degrees) for one second, then retarding it to align with the right throttle (both at 16 degrees) for one second, and finally splitting the throttles to advance the left throttle (to 31 degrees) while retarding the right to idle (0 degrees). Nine seconds after moving the right throttle to idle, the crew placed the right engine run switch to off, shutting down the right engine. Finally, at 12:51:19, the left throttle was advanced to full power (40 degrees), briefly cycled then brought to idle. At 12:51:23, both throttles were advanced from idle to full power. It is likely the crewÂs first actions, including the shutdown, were hastened by a sense of urgency due to aircraft vibrations and other auditory/sensory cues, reinforced by the startle response. The crew announced to Kabul ATC that they had lost both engines and that they intended to proceed to Kandahar, which was well outside the E-11A glide capabilities. This intent suggests that the crew was confident of airstarting one or both engines. While the crew would have waited, in accordance with the checklist, to 30,000 feet to attempt an airstart, an airstart of the right engine should have been successful, whether accomplished with windmilling airspeed or with the assistance of the APU. However, airstarts of the left engine would have failed due to the original damage. There is no DFDR data to definitively confirm whether an engine airstart attempt was made. At 13:03:30, the crew announced to ATC that they were going to land at FOB Sharana. The aircraft continued to glide without engine power and was not able to reach Sharana. At approximately 13:09, the aircraft impacted the ground approximately 21 NM (39 km) short of Sharana, on a heading of roughly 140 degrees, consistent with a direct flight path towards Sharana. The terrain was unpopulated, largely flat, and covered in snow. The wings show the slats out and the flaps appear to be extended, suggesting that the aircraft had been configured for, and presumably slowed for, landing. It is likely that the crew attempted to make a forced landing. While the terrain was largely flat, the aircraft impacted berms and ditches, roughly estimated between 3-6 feet high. Weather at Sharana was reported to have 1000 foot ceilings, and pilot testimony confirms approximately 1000 foot ceilings in the vicinity of the accident site. Accordingly, the crew may have had less than a minute to maneuver after exiting the clouds and seeing the terrain. It appears that while the aircraft touched down, it impacted a smaller berm almost immediately, then more completely impacted the ground and skidded to a halt in approximately 340 meters. During this time the wings were ripped from the aircraft, and subsequently much of the cockpit and cabin were destroyed by fire. The Accident Investigation Board (AIB) President found by a preponderance of the evidence that the cause of the mishap was the MC's error in analyzing which engine had catastrophically failed (left engine). This error resulted in the MC's decision to shutdown the operable right engine creating a dual engine out emergency. The AIB President also found by a preponderance of the evidence that the MC's failure to airstart the right engine and their decision to recover the MA to KAF substantially contributed to the mishap.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: USAF AIB Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-recovers-two-killed-in-air-force-crash-in-taliban-territory-11580232907  https://www.airforcetimes.com/news/your-air-force/2021/01/21/broken-fan-blade-shutdown-of-wrong-engine-led-to-fatal-e-11-crash-in-afghanistan-report-says/  https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2020/01/27/us-army-investigating-plane-crash-in-taliban-held-area/  https://aerossurance.com/air-accidents-incidents/usaf-e11a-global-express-psmicr/  https://www.acc.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/2478327/e-11a-accident-investigation-board-report-released/  https://www.afjag.af.mil/Portals/77/AIB-Reports/2020/27JAN20%20ACC%20Bagram%20Airfield%20E-11%20AIB%20Report.pdf  Location  Images: photo (c) Bart Hoekstra; Mildenhall RAF Station (MHZ/EGUN); 11 March 2019 Media: Startled Shutdown - Fatal USAF E-11A Global Express PSM+ICR Accident: The crew shut down the serviceable engine and try to reach an airfield 230 NM away rather than ones close by. aerossurance.com/air-accident... #military #accident #flightsafety #aviationsafety #humanfactors[image or embed]— Aerossurance (@aerossurance.bsky.social) January 3, 2025 at 11:46 AMStartled Shutdown - Fatal USAF E-11A Global Express PSM+ICR Accident: The aircraft force lands in Afghanistan and burns out.  aerossurance.com/air-accident... #military #accident #flightsafety #aviationsafety #humanfactors[image or embed]— Aerossurance (@aerossurance.bsky.social) January 3, 2025 at 11:48 AMRevision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates30-Dec-2024 13:07 Aerossurance Updated [Source, ]31-Dec-2024 15:34 Aerossurance Updated [Source, ]31-Dec-2024 17:21 Aerossurance Updated [Operator, Source, Embed code, Narrative, ]01-Jan-2025 11:36 Aerossurance Updated [Narrative, ]02-Jan-2025 16:05 Aerossurance Updated [Source, ]03-Jan-2025 11:49 Aerossurance Updated [Embed code, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The aircraft stopped 90 meters beyond the paved end of the runway stopway in the middle of a road. All occupants safely evacuated the aircraft. The aircraft took off from Tehran-Mehrabad Airport at 06:24 hours local time and climbed to the cruising altitude of FL320. The flight was subsequently cleared direct to GODMO. After contacting the controller at Mahshahr the crew was informed: ""runway active is 31; wind is now 280/08kts, CAVOK, temperature +06, DP 04 and QNH 1023, expected VOR approach runway 31 via GODMO 1E Arrival"". The flight responded by requesting runway 13 for landing. ATC then cleared the flight for a VOR/DME approach to runway 13 using the GODMO 1F Arrival procedure. At 07:30:41 local time, the pilot reported over position GODMO at FL100. ATC replied: ""CPN 6936 yes sir; descend as profile to MNM 2000 feet for VOR/DME APP RWY 13, report when leaving IAF and cleared approach."" At 07:32:46, the pilot reported leaving the Initial Approach Fix (IAF) MNM. At that time the aircraft was flying at an altitude at 6647 ft instead of 2000 ft as required. The controller cleared the flight to land. As the aircraft passed 2500 ft, the autopilot was disengaged. Then the captain decided to control altitude and speed by executing an S-turn maneuver several times and continued in visual reference with the ground. At 07:35:29, at altitude 934 ft, the captain asked the copilot to set speed and the copilot called out the target airspeed of 135 knots when the actual speed (IAS) at the time was 196 kt.  Upon receiving EGPWS Sink Rate warnings, the copilot warned the pilot to read the landing checklist, but the captain did not accept this and accomplished an unstabilized high-speed approach for the purpose of landing.  The copilot claimed in his statement after the accident that: ""I wanted to take control of the aircraft and follow missed approach procedure but due to pilot over-confidence to overcome present situation and age gap, I disregarded it."" The captain was a 64-year old pilot with over 18000 flying hours, compared to the 28-year old copilot who had 300 hours. From 1000 ft until 10 ft altitude, sink rate and pull up warnings sounded in the cockpit successively. Finally, at 07:36:11, the aircraft landed with high speed (171 kt) after passing two-thirds of the runway. It touched down nosegear-first and bounced. Full auto thrust reversers and brakes were applied. The aircraft overran the runway, rolled through a non-paved area and airport perimeter fence, passed a shallow canal then onto an adjacent roadway, where it struck a concrete median strip and a lamp post before coming to a stop.  Runway 13 has a Landing Distance Available (LDA) of 8874 feet (2705 m). Probable Causes: The Aircraft Accident Investigation Board determines that the probable causes of this accident were the pilotsÂ failures below, resulting in a runway overrun: - Poor decision-making for acceptance of the risk of high-speed landing; - Un-stabilized approach against the normal flight profile; - Poor CRM in the cockpit; and - Poor judgment and not accomplishing go-around while performing an unstabilized approach. Contributing Factors: - Loading of 5 tons of extra fuel, which increased the landing distance required. - Decision to make a landing on RWY 13 with tailwind. - Inability of the copilot (PM) to take control of the aircraft and proper action to execute go-around.METAR: 03:00 UTC / 06:30 local time: OIAM 270300Z 29008KT 8000 NSC 06/04 Q102204:00 UTC / 07:30 local time: OIAM 270400Z 28006KT CAVOK 06/04 Q102305:00 UTC / 08:30 local time: OIAM 270500Z 29006KT 7000 NSC 07/05 Q1023Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Iran Report number: A981107EPCPZ Status: Investigation completedDuration: 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: CAO Iran   Location  Images: photo (c) Mehr News, Ahmad Rostami; Bandar Mahshahr Airport (MRX/OIAM); 27 January 2020 photo (c) Mehr News, Ahmad Rostami; Bandar Mahshahr Airport (MRX/OIAM); 27 January 2020 photo (c) Mehr News, Ahmad Rostami; Bandar Mahshahr Airport (MRX/OIAM); 27 January 2020 photo (c) Mehr News, Ahmad Rostami; Bandar Mahshahr Airport (MRX/OIAM); 27 January 2020 photo (c) Mehr News, Ahmad Rostami; Bandar Mahshahr Airport (MRX/OIAM); 27 January 2020 photo (c) Mehr News, Ahmad Rostami; Bandar Mahshahr Airport (MRX/OIAM); 27 January 2020 photo (c) AAIB Iran; Bandar Mahshahr Airport (MRX); 27 January 2020 photo (c) Javidfa; Tehran-Mehrabad Airport (THR/OIII); 01 June 2017; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

It was snowing at the time of the accident.  During the landing roll on runway 33, the aircraft departed the cleared area of the runway to the left, contacted a windrow, travelled partially off the runway surface, returned to the runway and stopped. The damage to the aircraft included the nose wheel collapsing and damage to the right propeller blades. The aircraft was ferried to Kelowna on May 27 and resumed service after final repairs on June 10, 2020. Findings as to causes and contributing factors 1. Given the falling snow and the snow-covered runway, there were limited visual cues available to the flight crew, which decreased their ability to accurately judge the aircraftÂs lateral position once it was beyond the threshold. 2. Snow clearing operations cleared the centre 100 feet of the runway, which resulted in windrows that were approximately 18 inches high along the edges of the cleared area. This reduced the pilotÂs lateral manoeuvring room during the landing. 3. The aircraft initially touched down 10 feet left of the centreline due to control inputs and variable wind conditions and, while the aircraft was still in a light weight-on-wheels condition, a gust contributed to a further deviation to the left until the left main landing gear came into contact with the windrow. 4. As the left main landing gear impacted the windrow, the drag on that landing gear caused the aircraft to pull to the left, causing the nose and right main landing gear to also come into contact with the windrow. 5. During the runway excursion, snow and ice became packed in the nose landing gear bay and caused structural deformation. Consequently, the nose landing gear was no longer being held in place and collapsed rearward into the fuselage, causing substantial damage to the aircraft.METAR: 04:00 UTC / 20:00 local time: CYXT 010400Z 35015G24KT 3/4SM -SN VV003 00/M00 A2903 RMK SN8 /S05/ SLP84105:00 UTC / 21:00 local time: CYXT 010500Z 03009KT 3/4SM -SN VV003 00/M00 A2903 RMK SN8 SLP84105:23 UTC / 21:23 local time: CYXT 010523Z 02010KT 3/4SM -SN VV003 00/M00 A2903 RMK SN8 SLP83906:00 UTC / 22:00 local time: CYXT 010600Z 35009G15KT 1SM -SN OVC010 00/00 A2905 RMK SN5SC3 /S08/ PRESRR SLP848Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A20P0013 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: TSB A20P0013 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  19 July 2019 C-FKWE WestJet Encore 0 Edmonton International Airport, AB (YEG) sub 4 September 2022 C-FKWE WestJet 0 25nm W of Moncton International Airport, NB (YQM/CYQM) unk Location  Images: photo (c) Leslie Snelleman; Vancouver International Airport, BC (YVR/CYVR); 27 May 2017 photo (c) RenÃ© Verschuur; Vancouver International Airport, BC (YVR/CYVR); 07 August 2015 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight had 361 persons onboard consisting of four flight crew, 24 cabin crew and 333 passengers. During cruise at flight level (FL) 330, in the airspace above Trout Peak, Rocky Mountains, Wyoming, the aircraft experienced moderate to severe turbulence at around 02:14 UTC, approximately 1 hour and 42 minutes after departure from KLAX.  The commander was the pilot flying. Because there was neither any significant weather in the area nor air traffic control reports of any turbulence, the commander had switched the seatbelt sign OFF after the aircraft had passed FL100 during the climb. The turbulence started just after the commander had initiated the climb to FL350 and he reacted by immediately turning the seatbelt sign ON and making a passenger announcement for cabin crew to take their seat. During the turbulence, which lasted for about one minute and 54 seconds. the aircraft airspeed increased but the maximum operating Mach (MMO) speed was not exceeded. The aircraft autopilot and autothrust remained engaged during the turbulence. The vertical speed of the aircraft varied between minus 580 feet per minute and positive 1,400 feet per minute with vertical gravitational g-loads between positive 0.44 G and positive 1.63 G. Amongst all persons onboard the aircraft, one passenger was injured which was classified as a serious injury. There was no reported damage to the aircraft cabin. The flight continued to the destination where the aircraft landed uneventfully. Causes The Air Accident Investigation Sector determines that the cause of the Accident was the acceleration forces imposed on the Aircraft as it flew through an area of clear air turbulence, which resulted in an unsecured passenger forcefully impacting cabin furnishings in the lavatory. Contributing Factors Lack of placarded instructions and inaccessibility of the handholds within the lavatory for use in case of turbulence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: GCAA Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: GCAA Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

Of the 8 occupants onboard, the commercial pilot and six adult passengers, along with one infant passenger, were not injured.  Day instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident, and an instrument flight plan was filed. The flight originated from HPB, about 15:58, and was destined for Bethel, Alaska (BET). According to the captain, the weather conditions the day of the accident consisted of snow, low visibility, and flat light. The original flight departure time had been delayed about 3 hours due to weather. The scheduled route of flight was from Bethel (BET), to Scammon Bay (SCM), to HPB, to Chevak (VAK), returning to BET with various passengers and cargo pick-ups and drop-offs along the route. Prior to departure from BET he received runway reports from his dispatcher that all destination airport runways were ready. He also obtained weather at all three destinations. He then did a risk analysis and gathered more weather before deeming the flight conditions good to dispatch the flight. While enroute to HPB he gathered weather for VAK and determined that the VAK portion of the flight would be canceled due to deteriorating weather. Once in HPB he landed without incident on the snow covered runway. He then called Grant dispatch in BET and informed that he would take all the passengers going to BET since he had canceled his flight to VAK; he loaded 7 passengers total and their bags. During the time on the ground, while waiting for passengers, a twin-engine King Air airplane landed and departed the runway with no incident. The pilot then back taxied for a runway 13 departure at HPB. He stated that flat light conditions prevailed, and it was difficult to see down the runway or have any depth perception. He initiated the takeoff with 20 degrees of flap selected and noticed no issues during the initial takeoff roll. He then noticed the airspeed was not increasing fast enough, witnessed the end of the runway approaching, and decided he could not abort the takeoff in time. Committed to the takeoff the airplane became airborne and the stall warning horn activated as the airplane cleared the departure end of the runway. The pilot attempted to get the airplane into ground effect, but the airplane settled, and the main landing gear encountered the snow covered terrain. Subsequently, the airplane's speed decreased, the nose wheel descended and encountered the snow, and the airplane came to rest upright about 150 ft from the end of the runway. All crew and passengers evacuated the airplane, and nobody was injured. The pilot added that the snow on the runway during departure was about 3-5 inches of wet heavy snow. Probable Cause: The pilotÂs decision to depart from a contaminated runway, and his failure to make a timely decision to abort the takeoff when the airplane was not accelerating as expected. Contributing to the accident was the pilotÂs decision to depart in limited visibility conditions, which likely affected his ability to determine the available runway distance remaining during the takeoff.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ANC20LA020 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  24 February 2002 N454SF Grant Aviation 0 Tununak, Alaska sub 13 December 2005 N454SF Grant Aviation 0 Newtok, Alaska sub Runway excursion 15 January 2008 N454SF Grant Aviation 0 Bethel, Alaska sub Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were 183 occupants on the aircraft. Three passengers died, the remaining 180 occupants were injured. The aircraft departed Izmir Airport at 17:22 hours. At the time the flight arrived in the vicinity of  Istanbul-Sabiha GÃ¶kÃ§en Airport, a thunderstorm was passing. Runway in use was 06. About 18:17 the Tower controller cleared another flight for takeoff from runway 06, reporting wind 300 degrees at 11 knots, gusting to 21 knots. The subsequent arrival was flight 2193, which was cleared to land with wind information given as 270 degrees at 22 knots, gusting to 30 knots. This translates to a 19 knot tailwind. Since the wind was shifting the controller reported to a flight on the ground that it was to expect a runway change for departure. At 18:19 Pegasus 2193 touched down, but failed to come to a complete stop on the runway. It overran and went down an embankment, breaking in three. The aircraft came to rest about 30 m below runway elevation. Data from flight tracking website Flightradar24 suggest that the aircraft was steered to the left at the end of the runway, likely as there was an antenna array just past the stopway. The last recorded ground speed was 63 knots as the aircraft crossed the perimeter road. Runway 06 is a concrete runway with a Landing Distance Available (LDA) of 3000 m. At the runway end there is a 65 m long stopway, followed by antenna array, perimeter road and a downslope. In March 2020 Turkish media reported on a preliminary report, issued by authorities. According to this report the aircraft was struck by lightning six minutes before landing. During the approach one of the preceding aircraft reported a sudden tailwind of 37 knots below 600 feet. This report was communicated in Turkish by the Tower controller. The Dutch first officer, who was Pilot Monitoring, did not understand this. Subsequent clearances and weather information were in English. After touchdown the speedbrake and autobrake activated. The thrust reversers were selected manually. After passing taxiway F at an airspeed of 57 knots, the speed brake and thrust reverser were switched off. The ground speed was reported to be 84 knots due to the effect of the wind. Six seconds later manual braking was resumed. The aircraft failed to stop on the runway, hit ILS antennas and a small building before it fell 30 m down the embankment.METAR: 14:50 UTC / 17:50 local time: LTFJ 051450Z VRB08G18KT 9999 -SHRA FEW025CB BKN036 BKN070 12/09 Q0990 NOSIG RMK RWY24 04009KT15:20 UTC / 18:20 local time: LTFJ 051520Z 29022G37KT 240V330 7000 -TSRA FEW017CB BKN025 BKN070 11/09 Q0992 RESHRA NOSIG RMK RWY24 33010G20KT 270V360 Sources: CNN TÃ¼rk  Airporthaber  Luchtvaartnieuws.nl   Location  Images: photo (c) Anna Zvereva; Istanbul-AtatÃ¼rk Airport (ISL/LTBA); 27 September 2018; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) Miklos Szabo; Istanbul-AtatÃ¼rk Airport (ISL/LTBA); 19 June 2018; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates17-Oct-2024 17:30 ASN Updated [Cn, ]02-Jan-2025 10:58 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Of the 73 passengers and crew onboard, one flight attendant received serious injuries and there were 22 minor injuries. The airplane sustained minor damage. The regularly scheduled domestic passenger flight was operating under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 from Charlotte Douglas International Airport (KCLT), Charlotte, North Carolina, to KTYS. The accident flight departed 4 hours late due to the late arrival of the inbound airplane in KCLT because of persistent severe weather that had been in the area. According to the flight crew, they kept the seatbelt sign illuminated for the entire flight because of the late night and weather in the area. They indicated that the takeoff, climb, and cruise were uneventful. Most of the flight was conducted at flight level (FL) 220 in clear air, with clouds beneath.  As they approached KTYS, the flight was cleared to descend at pilot's discretion to 13,000 feet. During the descent, the onboard radar was on but did not depict any precipitation in the cloud layer below them. In the early stages of the descent, the flight began entering and exiting various cloud layers and experienced very light/intermittent chop. At about FL 185, the flight went into a cloud and encountered severe turbulence, causing the autopilot to disengage and the airplane pitched nose down rapidly. The pilot flying reduced power, leveled the wings, and the airplane quickly exited the clouds into visual meteorological (VMC) conditions again. The flight continued to experience moderate turbulence during the descent.  The captain called back to check on the flight attendants (FA) and passengers but initially received no reply. A short time later, the captain called back again and was informed by a dead-heading flight attendant (FA) that both FAs had been injured.  At the time of the turbulence encounter, the forward FA was preparing the galley for landing and was thrown to the ceiling and back to the floor, injuring both ankles. The FA could not stand, and a dead-heading pilot helped her to a passenger seat.  The aft FA was conducting final compliance checks in the cabin and was also thrown to the ceiling and back to the floor, causing her to black out for a short time. Multiple passengers received various injuries, that included head bumps/bruises, scrapes, and anxiety issues. Two dead-heading FAs assumed the duties of the two injured FAs for the remainder of the flight. After landing, paramedics met the airplane at the gate and the two FAs and several passengers were transported to the hospital.  The forward FA was diagnosed with fractures in both ankles. Post accident examination of the weather data determined that the turbulence encounter occurred in a strong sheared environment with a 155-knot jet stream. There were several pilot reports (PIREPs) of moderate to severe turbulence in the area, and there was a National Weather Service SIGMET current for severe turbulence in the area. Probable Cause: An encounter with severe convective turbulence associated with a strong sheared environment associated with the jet stream.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA20CA071 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA20CA071  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

There were no injuries among the 166 passengers. The captain on the flight from Berlin Tegel Airport was the Pilot Flying (PF). The flight had been uneventful, although the flight crew was aware of unfavourable weather conditions in Keflavik with winds around 40 knots, gusting to 53-56 knots. Flight 529 was cleared direct to NONBO by Keflavik Approach. The captain briefed his intentions to land a bit further down the runway than normal (3 white and 1 red on the PAPI), to avoid turbulence on short final. When the airplane reached NONBO, it intercepted the localizer and the ILS was followed down towards runway 10. The airplane encountered considerable turbulence at 1000 feet above MSL. The autopilot was disengaged between 600 and 700 feet above MSL and the airplane was then manually flown down towards the runway. The airplane was flown with the nose into the wind on final approach due to crosswind conditions. Few seconds before touchdown the airplane was de-crabbed to line up with the runway heading. The flare was normal and the airplane initially touched down on its right main landing gear. Then the left main landing gear touched the runway. Almost immediately thereafter, as the nose was gradually coming down, abnormal sound was observed and the right side of the airplane sunk down. The airplane speedbrake deployed momentarily and the right engine hit the runway. The airplane then leveled off again and the nose landing gear touched the runway. The airplane wobbled as it continued down the runway, on the left main landing gear and the nose landing gear only, as the PF fought to keep the airplane level and centered on the runway, utilizing the aileron and rudder controls. As the airplane speed decreased, the aerodynamics of the wings and the effectiveness of the rudder and aileron control diminished, until the PF could no longer keep the airplane wings level. The right wing sunk down again and the right engine hit the runway again. The airplane skid on the runway until it came to stop, still on the runway but with a magnetic heading of 115Â°.  During the on-site investigation it became clear that the nut used to fasten the swivel in the lug position on the main landing gear shock strut was missing along with its mating washer-splined. These parts were found on the runway where the touchdown occurred. Further investigation showed that the swivel threads were undersized 1/16 inch during an overhaul in December 2008. The SWIVEL threads were then undersized again during an overhaul in November 2019, bringing it to 1/8 inch undersize. Such an undersize was allowed but required a special 1/8 undersized nut to be fabricated and used. However, the nut on TF-FIA was found to be too large.METAR: 15:00 UTC / 15:00 local time: BIKF 071500Z 13040G53KT 5000 -DZRA BR OVC010 07/06 Q096815:30 UTC / 15:30 local time: BIKF 071530Z 13042G56KT 6000 BR OVC013 07/06 Q096716:00 UTC / 16:00 local time: BIKF 071600Z 13042G55KT 8000 BR OVC013 07/06 Q0966Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: RNSA Report number: 20-014F001 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: ruv.is  visir.is  mbl.is History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  7 April 2015 TF-FIA Icelandair FlugfÃ©lag Islands 0 ReykjavÃ­k-KeflavÃ­k International Airport (KEF) min Lightningstrike Location  Images: photo (c) Harro Ranter / ASN; Billund Airport (BLL/EKBI); 07 May 2011 photo (c) Miklos Szabo; KeflavÃ­k International Airport (KEF/BIKF); 06 May 2017 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

He was also type rated in the Cessna 500.  The second in command, seated in the left seat, held a private pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single-engine land and instrument airplane. The pilot was scheduled to attend flight training to obtain a Cessna 500 type rating. After departure the controller issued local weather information and instructed the pilots to climb to 7,000 ft mean sea level (msl). The controller issued the pilots a pilot report (PIREP) for trace to light rime icing between 9,000 ft and 11,000 ft, and one of the pilots acknowledged. Then, the controller instructed the pilots to climb to 10,000 ft and to turn right to 020Â°. The controller observed the airplane on a northwest bound heading and asked the pilots to verify their heading. A pilot responded that they were returning to a 320Â° heading, to which the controller instructed him to maintain 10,000 ft. The controller asked the pilots if everything was alright, and a pilot responded that they had a problem with the autopilot. The controller instructed the pilots to again maintain 10,000 ft and to advise when they were able to accept a turn. The controller again asked if everything was alright or if they needed assistance; however, neither pilot responded. The controller again asked the pilots if everything was under control and if they required assistance, to which one of the pilots replied that they were ""OK now."" The airplane climbed to 10,500 ft and the controller instructed the pilots to maintain 10,000 ft and again asked if everything was under control. A pilot responded in the affirmative and stated that they were ""playing with the autopilot"" because they were having trouble with it, and the controller suggested that they turn off the autopilot and hand-fly the airplane. The airplane descended to 9,000 ft and the controller instructed the pilots to maintain 10,000 ft and asked them if they could return to the departure airport to resolve the issues. One of the pilots requested a higher altitude to get into visual flight rules (VFR) conditions, and the controller instructed him to climb to 12,000 ft, advised that other aircraft reported still being in the clouds at 17,000 ft, and asked their intentions. The pilot requested to continue to their destination and the controller instructed him to climb to 13,000 ft. One of the pilots established communication with another controller at 11,500 ft and stated they were climbing to 13,000 ft on a 360Â° heading. The controller instructed the pilot to climb to 16,000 ft and inquired if their navigation issues were corrected. A pilot advised the controller that they had problems with the left side attitude indicator and that they were working off the right side. The controller cleared the airplane direct to the destination airport and asked if they were above the clouds as they were climbing through 15,400 ft. The airplane then began a left turn and soon after radar contact was lost at 10:13.  The main wreckage of the airplane was located around 1330 on the day of the accident. It came to rest in a wooded area, inverted, and partially submerged in a creek at an elevation of 703 ft mean sea level. Several parts of the airplane were not located in the vicinity of the main wreckage but were in the wooded area surrounding the main wreckage, consistent with an inflight breakup. The debris path was about 7,000 ft long on a 005Â° heading. Probable Cause: The pilotsÂ loss of control in flight in freezing instrument meteorological conditions due to spatial disorientation and the cumulative effects of task saturation.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA20FA096 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: FAA  Flightaware tracklog  WSBTV   Location  Images: photo (c) Niall Moran; unknown; 18 April 2017; (CC:by-nc-sa) photo (c) Brian Gore; Atlanta-DeKalb Peachtree Airport, GA (PDK/KPDK); 08 October 2015 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft took off from Moscow's Vnukovo Airport at 06:59 UTC and landed at Usinsk about 09:20 UTC (12:20 LT). It touched down in the snow, 32 meters short of the threshold of runway 13. The aircraft the it a snow bank, causing the main landing gears to separate. The aircraft slid down the runway and came to rest on the edge, perpendicular to the runway. All occupants evacuated the aircraft safely. The accident with the Boeing 737-500 VQ-BPS aircraft occurred during the landing as a result of a collision of the aircraft with a snow parapet 1.1 m high at a distance of 32 m to the runway threshold (within the paved section of the runway), which resulted in damage to the main landing gear and their subsequent ""folding"" in the process of moving along the runway. The accident was caused by a combination of the following factors: - the presence of contradictions in the Federal Aviation Rules for flights in the airspace of the Russian Federation, the airline's radio control system and the aircraft operational documentation regarding the need and procedure for introducing temperature corrections to the readings of barometric altimeters at low ambient temperatures; - Failure by the operator of the Usinsk aerodrome to comply with the FAP-262 requirements for the maintenance of the aerodrome, which resulted in the presence of snow parapets on the paved section of the landing strip; - the operator of the Usinsk aerodrome did not eliminate the shortcomings in the winter maintenance of the aerodrome, noted based on the results of the inspection by the Rosaviatsia commission on January 22, 2020; - lack of risk assessment in the airline associated with the execution of approaches in the baro-VNAV mode in the presence of factors that impede such approaches (low ambient temperatures, snow-covered underlying surface, drifting snow (snowstorm), significant changes in the relief in front of the runway end, lack of PAPI-type lights), as well as appropriate recommendations to the crews on the specifics of such approaches, including after the transition to visual flight, and crew training; - insufficient assessment by the crew during the preparation of the existing threats (hazard factors) and making an insufficiently substantiated decision to perform an RNAV (GNSS) approach (under the control of the autopilot in LNAV/VNAV mode) without introducing a correction for low outside air temperature in altitude overflying waypoints, which led to a flight below the established glide path; - performing a flight along the ""extended glide path"" after turning off the autopilot and switching to manual piloting without attempting to enter the set glide path; - the PIC may have had a visual illusion of a ""high glide path"" due to a snow-covered underlying surface, a snowstorm and the presence of a ravine directly in front of the runway end in the absence of PAPI type lights, which led to an incorrect assessment of the aircraft's flight altitude after switching to manual piloting, lack of reaction to timely and correct warnings of the co-pilot and exit to the runway end at a height significantly less than the established one.METAR: 05:30 UTC / 08:30 local time: METAR UUYS 090530Z 17006MPS 9000 Â SG OVC007 M24/M26 Q1003 R13/490534 NOSIG RMK QFE744/0993=Wind 170 at 6 mps; 9000 m visibility, 700 ft overcast, temperature: -24Â°C09:10 UTC / 12:10 local time: SPECI UUYS 090910Z 17006G11MPS 1500 SN BLSN BKN015 M21/M23 Q0999 R13/390238 TEMPO 1000 SN BLSN RMK QFE741/0989=Wind 170 at 6, gusting to 11 mps; 1500 m visibility in snow and blowing snow, broken clouds at 1500 ft, temperature: -21Â°CAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: Ren.tv   Location  Images: photo (c) MAK; Usinsk Airport (USK); 09 February 2020 photo (c) Anna Zvereva; Saint Petersburg-Pulkovo Airport (LED/ULLI); 10 September 2016; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot and the one passenger were not injured.  The airplane was climbing through flight level (FL) 225 for FL 380, when the pilot heard a ""loud crashing noise"" followed by a ""turbulent air sound"" he described as similar to flying with the main landing gear extended. At time of the initial noise, the pilot reported the airplane was on a heading of 255, the airspeed was about 265 to 270 kts, and the autopilot system was engaged. The autopilot system was set to lateral navigation and the vertical speed was set for 1,500 ft per minute for climbing.  The pilot reacted to the initial noise by disconnecting the autopilot system, announcing the issue to air traffic control (ATC), slowing down the airplane to 170 kts, and descending to 11,000 ft above mean sea level. There were no master caution or warning lights illuminated on the cockpit annunciation panel. The pilot initially thought the airplane had a main landing gear malfunction based of the sound of the airflow around the cabin. The pilot slowed the airplane further, cycled the main landing gear, cycled the flaps, and moved the flight controls. He reported everything checked out normal except the ""turbulent air sound"" which was exacerbated with rudder movement. The pilot decided the main landing gear was functioning normally and there was a problem with the empennage. The pilot located the closest airport with a paved runway greater than a 5,000 ft length, contacted ATC, and proceeded to land at the Mineral Wells Airport (MWL), Texas. The pilot executed an uneventful landing at 15:45 and shutdown the airplane without further incident.  A post landing inspection revealed the top and bottom cowling for the number 2 (right) engine were missing. A portion of the separated cowlings was found wrapped around the inboard section of the right horizontal stabilizer. A portion of the separated cowlings impacted the area between the leading edge of the vertical stabilizer and the top of the fuselage, resulting in substantial damage. The remaining pieces of the separated cowlings have not been recovered.  On-scene examination revealed that receptacle 29, at the forward inboard side of the lower cowl door, was missing its stud, snap ring, and grommet and that receptacles 26 and 28 were missing their grommets and snap rings but had retained their studs. The most likely cause of the cowl door departure is that either the stud at receptacle 29 was left unlocked when the cowl door was attached, or an oversized stud was used at receptacle 29 that was able to rotate from the locked to unlocked position. Without the stud to examine and additional on-wing testing, it cannot be determined whether the stud at that location was a longer grip-length stud or if spontaneous unlocking of a longer grip-length stud is an actual possibility. The reason for the separation of the cowlings could not be determined because the stud in question was not recovered. Probable Cause: The in-flight separation of the upper and lower right engine cowlings for reasons that could not be determined based on available evidence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN20LA082 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) FAA; Benbrook, TX; February 2020 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were 11 persons on board the aircraft; 2 pilots and 9 passengers. The pilot flying the aircraft was undergoing route and airstrip training. He was occupying the left seat and was Pilot Under Instruction (PUI). The pilot in the right seat was the instructor pilot for MAF conducting route and airstrip training for the new pilot. The pilot crossed overhead of the airstrip for an inspection of the surface and wind conditions. The crew did not observe any standing water or any wet areas on the strip. They also reported that the windsock indicated calm winds and the strip was clear. The aircraft joined mid-downwind less than half a nautical mile from the airstrip and tracked North West, descending from 1200 ft to 1000 ft before turning onto base. The aircraft began descending as it turned to line up on the final approach profile. There was a tailwind component of 5-12 kt on base and final. The aircraft overshot the turn onto final approach, 1.8 nm from the threshold at 900 ft. The pilot established the aircraft on the approach profile 1 nm from the threshold and at about 500 ft. The instructor stated that during final approach, the aircraft had descended below the normal approach profile causing him to instruct the pilot to adjust power and aim point to get back onto the correct profile. The pilot commenced the flare just under 20 ft AGL, 78 kt (85 kt ground speed). The aircraft touched down with an airspeed of 77 kt (82 kt ground speed) 36 m past the runway 11 threshold. The pilot stated that a few seconds after touchdown, he applied reverse thrust and the aircraft veered left. According to tyre track approximations, the aircraft appeared to have deviated about 220 m up-strip from threshold. The pilot stated that he applied full right rudder in an attempt to turn the aircraft back towards the center of the strip. The aircraft turned back to the right and rolled parallel to the centerline for another 100 m before it swerved left again, diverging at a 30Â° angle from the centerline. It rolled for 60 m as it bogged into the soft ground. The propeller blades subsequently struck the ground and the aircraft turned sharply left causing it to tip onto its starboard side. The crew reported that there were no injuries sustained during the accident and subsequent evacuation. Causes [Contributing factors] Onlanding,the PUI applied reverse thrust and the aircraft veered left of the centerline. Rudder was applied to get the aircraft back onto centerline, however, the rudder was not effective to counter the effect of reverse thrust as the left wheel entered in a softened area of the strip surface, which resulted in the aircraft being unable to regain the centerline as the landing roll progressed. The PUI did not effectively manage the effect of torque to maintain centerline during the landing roll.  The PUIÂs limited experience level on the aircraft type, low proficiency level in the use of reverse thrust during landing rolls, soft strip surface and soil condition were contributing factors of the accident.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIC PNG Report number: AIC 20-1002 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: AIC PNG Media Release   Location  Images: photo (c) AIC PNG; Miyanmin Airstrip (MPX); February 2020 photo (c) AIC PNG; Miyanmin Airstrip (MPX); February 2020 photo (c) AIC PNG; Miyanmin Airstrip (MPX); February 2020 photo (c) AIC PNG; Miyanmin Airstrip (MPX); February 2020 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot and two passengers were fatally injured, and the airplane was destroyed. The airplane was registered to TLC Air, LLC and operated by Lauren Engineers & Constructors, Inc.  The airplane was cleared for takeoff from runway 35L at Abilene Regional Airport, Texas. Shortly afterwards the pilot was instructed to climb to 12,000 ft and was then cleared to climb to FL230. The pilot reported to the controller that they encountered freezing drizzle and light rime icing on the climb from 6,400 ft to 8,000 ft. As the airplane climbed through 11,600 ft, the pilot reported that they were having an issue with faulty deicing equipment and needed to return to the airport. The controller instructed the pilot to descend to 11,000 ft and cleared them direct to Abilene Airport. The flight was then instructed to descend to 7,000 ft and asked if there was an emergency. The pilot responded in the negative and stated that they blew a breaker when they encountered icing conditions, and that it was not resetting. The controller then instructed the pilot to descend to 5,000 ft and to expect the ILS runway 35R approach. The controller then instructed the pilot to turn to a heading of 310. Shortly afterwards the controller asked the pilot if they were turning to the assigned heading; the pilot responded that they were having issues with faulty instruments. When controller asked the aircraft to report their altitude, the pilot reported that they were at 4,700 ft. The controller then instructed the pilot to maintain 5,000 ft. The pilot responded he was ""pulling up"". There was no further communication with the pilot. Preliminary review of the airplane's radar track showed the airplane's departure from ABI and the subsequent turn and southeast track towards its destination. The track appeared as a straight line before a right turn was observed. The turn radius decreased before the flight track disappeared. The airplane impacted terrain in a right wing low attitude, followed by the right engine, then left engine. The wreckage path was on an initial heading of 320Â°, and continued for about 570 ft.

During the final descent into CYYC, the flight crew selected flaps 20 and immediately received a flaps fail caution message. The decision was made to abandon the approach, and the crew received clearance from ATC to proceed NW of the CYYC airport and troubleshoot the issue. The crew executed the applicable QRH procedure and subsequently received clearance from ATC to proceed with the landing. A flaps 0 landing was then executed. During the landing roll, after ground spoiler and thrust reverser deployment, the nose of the aircraft attained a significant nose high attitude. The rear fuselage of the aircraft struck the runway, and during the recovery, the nose landing gear subsequently impacted the runway. The aircraft taxied clear of the runway and to the intended parking area. Subsequent inspection revealed that the aircraft sustained significant structural damage to the forward fuselage and minor damage to the rear fuselage. There were no injuries. Findings as to causes and contributing factors 1. Moisture entered the flap flexible drive shaft casing, likely through the undetected puncture holes and the drive shaft casing to flap actuator interface, which led to the subsequent corrosion and failure of the inner drive shaft. 2. As the occurrence aircraftÂs actual annual utilization was approximately half of that expected by the manufacturer, the calendar time interval between maintenance inspections increased. As a result, the corrosion that developed was not detected because the shaft had not yet reached the 2400 flight-hour maintenance interval. 3. The Challenger 605 flight simulator used for recurrent training did not accurately represent the zero-flap handling characteristics of the aircraft when the thrust reversers are deployed, nor was it required for certification. As a result, the flight crew was inadequately prepared to prevent, or recover from, the nose pitch-up that occurred when the thrust reversers were deployed. 4. The pilot monitoring did not read the cautions included on the flaps fail checklist out loud to the pilot flying during the completion of the Quick Reference Handbook procedure. As a result, information critical to the safe operation of the aircraft was not brought to the pilot flyingÂs attention. 5. Insufficient pressure was applied to the control column to maintain the nose on the runway while using maximum reverse thrust; as a result, the nose pitched up, the aft fuselage contacted the runway, and the aircraft transitioned to a partial weight-off-wheels state. 6. When the left main wheel left the runway surface and the angle of attack reached 28.9Â°, the stick pusher activated and commanded a rapid nose-down pitch input. As a result of this rapid nose-down pitch, the forward section of the aircraft was damaged when the nose wheel contacted the runway.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A20W0016 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: TSB A20W0016   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight was conducted in accordance with the Visual Flight Rules (VFR). There were fifteen passengers, two pilots and one cabin crew onboard the aircraft. The accident occurred during landing on the water aerodrome at Kuredu Island Resort. At the time of the accident the water aerodrome was experiencing squally winds and rough seas under sunny conditions, common during the north east monsoon that is typical to the time of the year. The aircraft, while landing on one of the designated (but unmarked) water runways, touched down and bounced. After the bounce, the aircraft banked to the left dipping the left wing-tip into the water and the aircraft veered to the left. The right wing of the aircraft then abruptly dropped with the aircraft nose digging into the water. The captain attempted to initiate a go around after the bounce without success. During the accident the fuselage, wings, engines and propellers of the aircraft sustained substantial damage. Both the floats remained intact and the aircraft was upright after the accident. The aircraft taxied to the mooring buoy using the left engine power and assistance by a dinghy. All passengers and crew were able to evacuate safely. However, as a direct consequence of the accident, two of the operating crew and one passenger suffered minor injuries. Causes: Power was added on approach at around 100 to 150 ft. The aircraft bounced on touchdown which indicates probable skipping of the aircraft due to higher speed and with the prevailing sea conditions encountered a sudden big wave.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AICC Maldives Report number: 2020/01 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: edition.mv History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  13 November 2021 8Q-MBC Trans Maldivian Airways 0 Kanifushi, Lhaviyani Atoll min Aborted takeoff Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

As the aircraft started the takeoff roll on runway 12, the aircraft directional control was lost and the aircraft exited the right side of the runway. The propellers subsequently contacted a snow bank and broke apart. Parts of the broken propellers penetrated the fuselage, injuring 1 passenger. The aircraft was substantially damaged. A similar accident occurred to a Skylink Charter Metro III on 29 September 2002. The aircraft, N343AE, veered off the runway on takeoff from Hawthorne Airport, California because one of the propellers was not out of the start lock. Findings as to causes and contributing factors 1. While the crew was carrying out the ""Before Taxi"" checklist, the ""Start Locks"" task was initiated; however, it was interrupted and not completed. 2. After the captain told the first officer to stand by, the crewÂs focus shifted to other tasks. It is likely that this slip of attention resulted in the power levers not being pulled over the flight idle gate to release the start locks. 3. The ""Before Taxi"" checklist did not contain a task to ensure that the start locks were removed and, as a result, the crew began taxiing unaware that the propellers were still on the locks. 4. After the engine was started or while the occurrence aircraft commenced taxiing for departure, it is likely that slight or rapid transient movements of the engine power levers, which were needed to taxi the aircraft, resulted in the release of the left propeller start locks while the right propeller start locks remained engaged. 5. As the power was advanced through 20%, the ""positive torque"" call required by standard operating procedures was not made, and the engine torque differential was not noticed by the crew. As a result, power lever advancement continued although the right engine torque/thrust remained near zero. 6. The engaged start locks on the right propeller prevented forward thrust, which resulted in a significant thrust differential. This differential thrust during the take-off roll resulted in a loss of directional control of the aircraft and, ultimately, a lateral runway excursion. 7. Following the runway excursion, the propellers, which were operating at a high rpm, shattered and splintered when they struck a frozen snowbank. 8. High-energy release of the nickel-cobalt erosion strips and splintered wood core debris from the propeller blades penetrated the reinforcement panel, fuselage skin and cabin wall, and resulted in serious injuries to a passenger sitting next to the penetrated cabin wallAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A20C0016 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: 29 Sept. 2002 Skylink Charter Metro III accident - same cause  TSB   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

At 07:48 local time, the controller issued takeoff clearance.  During takeoff roll, about 2 seconds after the PM called the aircraft speed of 80 knots, the pilots felt aircraft vibration, which became severe as the aircraft speed increased. When the aircraft speed was about 110 knots, the PF decided to reject the takeoff and felt that the aircraft direction could not be controlled and the braking was ineffective. The aircraft skidded longitudinally with the nose headed to the right. Thereafter, the aircraft veered to the right and continued until it went off the side of the runway. The aircraft was still moving on the right of the runway shoulder with the nose headed on the runway heading. After crossing taxiway D, the aircraft speed decreased while the aircraft was turning about 360 degrees. The aircraft stopped on the right runway shoulder about 1,600 meters from the beginning of runway 30 on heading 270Â°. Observing the runway condition, about 500 meters from the beginning runway 30, there was an oscillated wheel mark of both main landing gears and continued until the last position of the aircraft.

There were five crewmembers onboard comprising the captain, the copilot and the flight engineer on the flight deck, together with a loadmaster and an aircraft engineer who were seated in the galley area. The flight was uneventful and the Aircraft landed at 08:45 UTC at HSSJ. Prior to departure, after one hour and 35 minutes on the ground, the captain and the aircraft engineer completed the transit check. The captain noticed oil dripping from the lower fuselage. The aircraft engineer advised the captain that four days before the green hydraulic system tank had been replaced and that the oil was most likely residue from this maintenance action. He assured the captain that the aircraft would be cleaned on arrival in Sharjah. The aircraft departed HSSJ at 10:20 UTC for OMSJ. The departure and flight were uneventful until when at FL350 in the Muscat flight information region (FIR), the captain requested a flight level change due to moderate turbulence. According to his statement, immediately after starting the descent, he received a report from the flight engineer that the fluid level in the yellow hydraulic system had rapidly decreased and the ""HYDRAU"" light had illuminated on the master warning panel, followed by an autopilot disconnect.  The checklist items for the hydraulic system loss from the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) were followed and the flight continued manually with the captain as the pilot flying (PF). According to the captain, Air Traffic Control (ATC) was not informed of the hydraulic system loss, but that the flight crew prepared for an extended landing distance of 1.2 times the normal landing distance. The aircraft landed at 15:15 UTC at OMSJ on runway 30 and exited on the high-speed taxiway B7. The captain stated that the descent, approach, landing and taxiing to the cargo apron were uneventful, and that the brakes functioned normally. The captain followed the marshallerÂs instructions and stopped the aircraft at the assigned A300 position mark on parking stand 57, in front of the cargo hangar. The captain stated that once the aircraft came to a stop, he applied manual brakes and set the parking brake. While the crew started the parking checklist, the copilot prepared to shut the engines down. When the captain looked up, he realized that the aircraft was moving forward and he applied manual brakes but the aircraft did not stop. He stated that he then steered to the left to avoid the cargo hangar in front of the aircraft but the aircraft continued to move until the No.1 engine collided with a tug which was parked in the equipment area, approximately 36 meters beyond the A300 position mark. An inspection identified that the yellow hydraulic system high-pressure filter housing, located in the lower fuselage, had fractured and leaked hydraulic fluid. Causes The Air Accident Investigation Sector of the United Arab Emirates determines that the causes of the Aircraft collision with a parking tow tug and the consequent substantial damage were: (a) The uncontrolled movement of the Aircraft by engine idle thrust beyond the parking stop line. (b) The Aircraft could not be maintained at rest after the initial stop because the selected parking brake was not operational due to a leak from a fracture in the yellow hydraulic system high-pressure filter head, and a failure of the accumulator system of the parking brake that could not be determined during the Investigation. (c) The Aircraft could not be stopped by manual braking because that the ÂManualÂ brake was disabled after the flight crew selected the ÂParkingÂ brake without prior confirmation that adequate parking pressure was available. 3.4 Contributing Factors to the Accident The Investigation identified that the following were contributing factors to the Accident: (a) Airbus had identified the design of the high-pressure filter head as one of two contributors to fractures developing at the head flange, but did not address this issue with equal priority. (b) The marshaller was not prepared to place wheel chocks on the AircraftÂs arrival at the parking bay and was therefore unable to react timely to obstruct the movement of the Aircraft.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: GCAA Report number: AIFN/0006/2020 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) GCAA UAE; Sharjah Airport (SHJ); 28 February 2020 photo (c) GCAA UAE; Sharjah Airport (SHJ); 28 February 2020 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

After accomplishing air work, the pilots returned to the airport to practice landings and takeoffs. According to both pilots, the first approach was normal, and the airplane touched down slightly right of the runway centerline. The trainee pilot stated that, after touchdown, the airplane began drifting further right and that he was unable to correct the deviation. The trainer pilot reported that, when directional control became unstable, he told the trainee, ""I have the controls."" The trainer pilot saw that the trainee pilot released his hands from the engine power levers and the yoke, but the airplane continued to deviate to the right, contrary to his control inputs and his addition of asymmetric power to the engines. The trainer pilot realized that, based on his inputs, the airplane should have returned to the centerline but that it did not and that it was behaving as if the trainee pilot was applying some braking. At that point, the trainer pilot again told the trainee pilot to release the controls, and he used the brakes, which he reported applied and released normally. Subsequently, the airplane exited the right side of the runway and impacted a ditch. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing. The trainer pilot and the operator reported that there were no mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation. The trainer pilot reported that he believed the trainee pilot's feet were either on the brakes or interfered with his brake and/or rudder application attempts. The trainee pilot reported that he could not recall the position of his feet after he relinquished airplane control to the trainer pilot.

Upon landing, the airplane touched down on the runway centerline in light and variable winds. The pilot recalled that the touchdown felt normal. During the landing roll, the airplane began to veer to the right and the pilot added left rudder in an effort to correct. Despite his attempts of full left rudder deflection, the airplane continued to veer off the runway. The airplane continued off the runway surface and encountered large rocks located between the runway and taxiway.

Eisenhower National Airport (ICT/KICT) to Hays Municipal Airport (HYS/KHYS) crashed in wheat field terrain northwest of La Crosse, Rush County, Kansas. The aircraft took off from ICT at 07:52 local time (12:52 UTC). At 08:25, the HYS automated weather observation service was reporting, in part, winds from 080Â° at 11 knots, visibility 1 statute mile, and overcast clouds at 200 ft above ground level.  The pilot made an ILS approach to runway 34 but was forced to execute a missed approach. The pilot stated to ATC his intention to attempt the ILS approach to runway 34 a second time. At 08:41, the HYS weather indicated that visibility had dropped to 0,25 statute mile in fog. Again, the pilot performed a missed approach. About 08:59 the pilot stated his intention to divert to Great Bend Airport (GBD), Kansas. The airplane began a turn to the south toward GBD while climbing to about 7,000 ft.  Around 09:06, the pilot began making unintelligible radio communications that air traffic controllers stated were unreadable. About 09:15, the controller asked the accident pilot if he was turning directly to GBD. After an unintelligible response from the pilot, the controller stated Âalright plane master sixteen seventy it's very difficult to understand there might be something wrong with uh your cockpit or your pressurization plane master sixteen seventy oxygen oxygen.Â About a minute later, the pilot was more easily understood. However, about 09:18, ATC made a transmission with no response from the pilot. At the same time the airplane began a descent and left turn.  About 09:20, an unintelligible response was received from the accident airplane. ATC then made numerous transmissions to the accident pilot urging him to utilize oxygen and open a window. No further communications were received from the accident airplane. The aircraft was found to have crashed in a field. The airplane's tail and wings were visible above ground, with the forward fuselage and engine section buried several feet under the terrain, consistent with a near-vertical, high-speed impact. The main landing gear was bent aft towards the tail with the left and right main wheel protruding from the ground.

There were four persons on board; one pilot and three passengers. There were no reported injuries. During final approach into the Yenkisa Airstrip, the pilot was affected by the visual illusion presented by the upslope strip. As a result, the pilot flew too low during the final approach. The pilot stated that during the approach, as the aircraft got closer to strip 31, he realised that he was coming too close to a protruding tree along the approach path and determined that he was too low. He immediately shallowed the descent angle. Subsequent to clearing the tree, the pilot found himself high on approach, passing the strip 31 edge. The pilot steepened the descent angle because he realized that he had overshot the strip 31 edge. During flare, the aircraft floated for some distance due to the excess energy from the steep descent. The aircraft touched down about 200 m beyond the edge of strip 31. During the initial part of the landing roll, because the strip was wet, the aircraft subsequently skid forward. The pilot did not use reverse thrust during the landing roll. The aircraft overran the airstrip, hit a mound of clay and rocks, subsequently tipping left into a gully. The Yenkisa Airstrip is located at an elevation of 3700 ft. Airstrip 13/31 has a Landing Distance Available of 465 m. Landings can only be performed on runway 31 because the runway has a 8.7% down slope to the south-east. CAUSES [CONTRIBUTING FACTORS] There were trees protruding the approach OLS into Yenkisa Airstrip, close to the edge of strip 31. No effective action had been taken before the accident, to cut the trees protruding the approach OLS for Yenkisa Airstrip, following the survey conducted by RAA in which the obstacles were identified. At the time of the accident, the pilot did not properly manage the aircraft during the final approach and landing roll. During the final approach, the pilot was affected by a visual illusion due to the 8.7% upslope of Yenkisa Airstrip. The presence of trees penetrating the approach OLS was identified by the pilot after passing the committal point defined by MAF. The pilot was focused in clearing the obstacle, losing the aiming point. The final approach was not stabilised. During the flare, the aircraft travelled further than the expected touchdown point. During landing, main landing gear wheels were most likely locked causing the aircraft to skid.

There were no injuries to the 127 passengers and crew, and the airplane was substantially damaged. According to the flight crew, the flight was cleared for a visual approach. The flight crew reported that the winds were from 040 degrees at 8 knots (slight tailwind), visibility greater than ten miles, and a thin layer of broken clouds at 17,000 feet.  The captain conducted an approach briefing and the first officer conducted a Landing Distance Assessment to account for the slight tailwind. The first officer reported the approach was normal and stabilized, and they encountered a slight downdraft in the flare. The captain disconnected the autopilot at about 400 feet above the ground and the autothrottle at 200 feet. Flight data recorder data indicated that the pitch attitude was about 7 degrees at touchdown but, as the ground spoilers deployed, pitch attitude increased to 10.9 degrees. There was a 3 to 5 knot crosswind at touchdown.  Post-flight inspection of the airplane indicated the underside of the rear fuselage struck the runway, resulting in damage to the skin, frames, and aft pressure bulkhead.

The crew flew a maximum effort (assault) landing at Ramstein Air Base and experienced a hard landing with a vertical acceleration load factor (g-load) exceedance value of 3.62 times the force of gravity (g) and a landing sink rate of 834 feet per minute exceeding the  aircraftÂs maximum allowable landing limits of 540 fpm and g-load of 2.0g. Immediately upon touchdown, the crew executed a go-around and coordinated with Air Traffic Control for a visual approach, full-stop landing. The aircraft landed safely at 17:37. The landing g-load exceedance resulted in significant damage to the center wing, both outer wings, left and right main landing gear assemblies, and engines, to include mounting structures. The estimated damages are $20,917,089. The crew of this mission was scheduled to fly in a formation of three C-130JÂs planning to conduct two training routes. The primary training objective for the local sortie was to complete the pilotÂs evaluation. The crew planned to takeoff early as a single-ship, conduct a maximum effort takeoff followed by a maximum effort landing using the painted landing zone marked on the runway as required for the evaluation, full-stop, and then rejoin the formation in order to complete the remainder of the evaluation requirements in the formation. Preflight, engine start, taxi and the Ramstein AB visual traffic pattern procedures were executed within good flying standards and were procedurally correct. The mishap occurred during the maximum effort landing. The Accident Investigation Board President found, by a preponderance of the evidence, the cause of this mishap was the pilot's early engine power reduction (power pull), beginning at 70 feet above ground level (AGL) and fully flight idle at 45 feet AGL. In addition, the board president found, by the preponderance of evidence, that the evaluated pilot and other pilotÂs failure to identify the excessive sink rate and their failure to arrest the excessive sink rate or go-around in a timely manner were substantially contributing factors that resulted in the aircraft exceeding the C-130J-30 g-load and sink rate landing limits.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: USAF AIB Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) USAF AIB; Ramstein AFB (RMS); April 2020 photo (c) USAF AIB; Ramstein AFB (RMS); April 2020 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

During the takeoff roll, at rotation speed, the airplane did not respond when the pilot pulled back on the control yoke. He tried to rotate again, and the airspeed was in excess of V1, about 130 knots. With no response, he performed a rejected takeoff with maximum braking and full reverse thrust.

At 12:16, the aircraft departed Cambridge Bay Airport for Kugaaruk (CYBB). The first officer was the pilot flying. At 13:19, when the flight was about 80 nautical miles from CYBB at flight level 210, the flight crew called the CYBB community aerodrome radio station. The flight crew received the runway surface condition report and were informed that the winds were from 200Â° true, at 24 knots gusting to 33 knots. At 13:20, the community aerodrome radio station operator called the flight crew and relayed the CYBB 1300 weather observation, reporting that the horizontal visibility was 1/4 statute mile in light snow and blowing snow and that the vertical visibility was 400 feet. The flight crew noted that the visibility had decreased since their departure from Cambridge Bay but continued the approach. The reported wind would result in a 12-to 16-knot crosswind component from the left on runway 23. The captain took control at 13:27, at the start of the descent, and descent checks were carried out. The captain transferred control back to the first officer at the initial approach waypoint, DATLA, and briefed for a pilot-monitored area navigation (RNAV) approach to runway 23. From the intermediate approach waypoint to the missed approach waypoint the approach is flown on a track of 244Â°T, which is offset 15Â° from the runway heading of 229Â°T. When the runway is acquired visually at or before the minimum descent altitude (MDA), a left turn is required to align the aircraft with the runway heading. During the descent the flight crew activated the runway lights and the precision approach path indicator (PAPI) system via the aircraft radio control of airport lighting system (ARCAL). The captain set the flaps to the approach setting (40%), and the first officer flew the descent. When the captain then confirmed visual contact with the runway, snow was blowing across it at an angle from left to right. The runway itself was apparent as a black shape within the blowing snow; however, the runway lighting and PAPI were not observed. The captain set the flaps to the land setting (100%) and then, as part of the pilot-monitored approach procedure, assumed control of the aircraft as the pilot flying. The first officer looked up from the instruments and observed, through the blowing snow, the runway as well as the community aerodrome radio station and airport apron ahead and off to the left. The aircraft crossed the runway threshold at 100 knots indicated airspeed. As the captain flared the aircraft, the first officer warned the captain of snowbanks off to the right side of the runway. At 13:50, when the right main landing gear touched down, the aircraft veered to the right and departed the runway surface. The right wing contacted snowbanks and the aircraft turned approximately 90Â° to the right before colliding nose first with a high snowbank. Both crew members, who were not injured, exited through the cabin door. The aircraft was substantially damaged; however, the freight remained secure. The emergency locator transmitter (ELT) did not activate and there was no fire. Findings as to causes and contributing factors 1. Approaches to airports north of 60Â°N latitude are not restricted by ground visibility and, as a result, the flight crew continued the approach when the reported visibility was Â¼ statute mile, which is lower than the published advisory visibility of 1Â¾ statute miles for this approach. 2. The flight crew believed that the lack of an approach ban permitted a landing, and landed at Kugaaruk Airport even though the reported ground visibility was below the minimum aerodrome operating visibility. 3. The offset approach, the crosswind component from the left, and the moving-runway illusion created by the blowing snow, all contributed to the aircraftÂs alignment with the right side of the runway. 4. The aircraft touched down near the right edge of the runway and, when the right landing gear impacted the deeper snow along the runway edge, the aircraft veered to the right and departed the runway surface. 5. The snow depth adjacent to the runway was allowed to exceed the limits dictated by the airport operatorÂs Winter Maintenance Plan. Consequently, the aircraft sustained additional damage when it departed the runway surface.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A20C0037 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources: CBC  TSB A20C0037   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot sustained no injury.  The flight departed the Corpus Christi International Airport (CRP), Texas, at 20:04 with 631 lbs of cargo and a fuel load of 2,800 lbs. During the initial climb, the captain selected the landing gear handle to the UP position to retract the landing gear. The attempt was unsuccessful, and the captain attempted to cycle the landing gear handle once more yielding the same result. Following the second unsuccessful gear retraction, the captain elected to leave the landing gear handle in the DOWN position and continued to the San Antonio International Airport (SAT), Texas, where more services would be available if needed. The airplane climbed to 8,000 ft mean sea level and cruised below the maximum landing gear extended speed (VLE). As the captain began to prepare for arrival at SAT, he retrieved the arrival automatic terminal information service (ATIS). The ATIS was reporting gusting winds out of the north, clear skies, and runway 4 as the active arrival runway. The captain began the descent toward the airport and air traffic control cleared the airplane for the visual approach to runway 4. The pilot entered a dogleg right base and completed the before landing checklist noting three green lights and no red lights, which indicated the landing gear was down, locked, and safe for landing. The airplane touched down around the aiming point marker on runway 4. As the main landing gear touched down on the dry concrete, the left main landing gear collapsed, the red unsafe light in the landing gear handle illuminated, and was followed by an aural horn indicating the landing gear was now unlocked and unsafe for landing. Simultaneously, the airplane began to dip toward the left, causing the left wing tip to contact the runway. The impact on the airplane resulted in the airplane's momentum taking the airplane from the runway centerline off the runway and into the grass area several thousand ft from the runway 4 threshold. Once the airplane came to a complete stop, the captain shutdown all power to the airplane and exited through the main entry air stairs. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing. A postaccident damage assessment by the operator revealed that the left main landing gear brace was fractured. Probable Cause: The failure of the left main landing gear upper drag leg arm due to substandard mechanical properties, which resulted in a collapse of the landing gear upon landing.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN20LA175 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) FAA; San Antonio International Airport, TX (SAT); 11 May 2020; (publicdomain) photo (c) FAA; San Antonio International Airport, TX (SAT); 11 May 2020; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Al 167 passengers and nine crew members on board were killed. The Boeing 737-800, registration UR-PSR, had landed on schedule at 00:57 hours local time at Tehran. The return leg back to Kiev was due to depart at 05:15 local time (01:45 UTC).  In the meantime, around 02:15 hours local time in Iran, numerous ballistic missiles were fired from Iran towards U.S. bases in Iraq in response to the killing of Major General Qasem Soleimani by a United States drone strike. As a result this military operation changed the alertness level of Iran's air defense. At approximately 04:00 the military sector informed the civil sector of the country's Airspace Control that only the flights already detected and cleared for flight operations by the defense network could be permitted to start up. This would ensure the correct identification of civil flights by the defense network and avoiding targeting them by mistake. At 05:49 the doors were closed and the aircraft was ready to depart. Two minutes later the flight requested the to start up the engines. After contacting the Area Control Center, the ATC unit requested clearance for the Ukrainian flight at 05:52. The Area Control Center forwarded the request for flight PS752 to the Air Defense Coordination Center, which subsequently issued the clearance accordingly. The aircraft then taxied to runway 29R and commenced the takeoff roll at 06:11. After takeoff the flight contacted Mehrabad Radar and was cleared to climb to FL260 and turn right after reaching 6000 feet, heading direct to the PAROT reporting point. As the aircraft was climbing after departure, it appeared on the air defense system. However, a wrong initialisation procedure of the system's north alignment had induced a 107-degree error in the system. Thus, the direction of objects and targets detected by this system was being observed with an increase of 107 degrees by the operator. At 06:13:56, the air defense unit operator detected a target at his 250-degree azimuth, flying on a 52-degree course. At the same time, PS752 had been flying towards the defense system from a 143-degree azimuth. The aircraft was flying a 309-degree course. At 06:14:21, the operator notified the specifications of the detected target to the Coordination Center over the communication network.  The notification was not communicated successfully. Meanwhile the system operator began analyzing the observable information and categorized the detected target as a threat. At 06:14:41, without receiving any response from the Coordination Center, the air defense unit operator fired a missile at the threatening target he had detected.  Under the applicable procedures, if the defense system operator cannot establish communication with the Coordination Center and does not receive the fire command, they are not authorized to fire.  The missile radio fuse was activated at 06:14:59. At that point flight PS752 was at 8100 feet at a position about 20 km west-northwest of the airport. After the first missile radio fuse was activated, the air defense unit radar still locked on the target, and the defense system kept detecting and tracking it. By observing the continuity of trajectory of detected target, the second missile was fired at the aircraft by the operator of defense system at 06:15:11. At 06:45:24, the last communication between the missile and the defense system was recorded in a place close to the aircraft route. After that, the defense system showed a message indicating the strike had failed, with the aircraft clearing from the radar lock-on after some time. The aircraft turned to the right and about 06:16:11, a fire broke out on the aircraft, which was intensifying. Altitude was lost and at 06:18:23, the aircraft crashed into a playground in Khalajabad near Shahedshahr area, 15 km north of the airport. It disintegrated completely and wreckage was strewn along a 300 m long path. Cause of the Accident The air defense's launching two surface-to-air missiles at the flight PS752, UR-PSR aircraft the detonation of the first missile warhead in proximity of the aircraft caused damage to the aircraft systems and the intensification of damage led the aircraft to crash into the ground and explode instantly. Other Contributing Factors - The mitigating measures and defense layers in risk management proved to be ineffective due to the occurrence of an unanticipated error in threat identifications, and ultimately failed to protect the flight safety against the threats caused by the alertness of defense forces.METAR: 02:44 UTC /  local time: OIIE 080200Z 28006KT CAVOK M01 / M04 Q1021Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Iran Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: TSB response to accident report  Ukraine Flight 752: New Video Shows First Missile Hit Plane (NY Times, 14 Jan. 2020)   Location  Images: photo (c) FARS News Agency; near Sabashahr; 08 January 2020; (CC:by) photo (c) FARS News Agency; near Sabashahr; 08 January 2020; (CC:by) photo (c) FARS News Agency, Hossein Mersadi; near Sabashahr; 08 January 2020; (CC:by) photo (c) FARS News Agency, Hossein Mersadi; near Sabashahr; 08 January 2020; (CC:by) photo (c) FARS News Agency, Hossein Mersadi; near Sabashahr; 08 January 2020; (CC:by) photo (c) FARS News Agency, Hossein Mersadi; near Sabashahr; 08 January 2020; (CC:by) photo (c) FARS News Agency, Hossein Mersadi; near Sabashahr; 08 January 2020; (CC:by) photo (c) FARS News Agency, Hossein Mersadi; near Sabashahr; 08 January 2020; (CC:by) photo (c) FARS News Agency, Hossein Mersadi; near Sabashahr; 08 January 2020; (CC:by) photo (c) CAO Iran; near Sabashahr; 08 January 2020 photo (c) Gilles Brion; GenÃ¨ve-Cointrin Airport (GVA/LSGG); 23 April 2017 photo (c) Arno Janssen; Jetfotos.de; DÃ¼sseldorf International Airport (DUS/EDDL); 25 March 2018 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates09-Oct-2024 13:55 ASN Updated [Destination airport, Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Of the 159 passengers and crew onboard, one flight attendant sustained serious injuries.  The airplane was not damaged. The flight was operating under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 as a regularly scheduled passenger flight from the KMSY to Newark Liberty International Airport (KEWR), Newark, New Jersey.   According to the flight crew, they advised the flight attendants (FA) to expect some light turbulence during the climb out, and stated they would leave the seatbelt sign illuminated for passengers until they had reached smooth air.  During the climb to their assigned altitude of flight level (FL) 370, the weather radar was active and air traffic control advised of weather directly in front of the flight.  As the flight was climbing through about FL 305 , the flight was in clear air but the crew realized they were not going to stay above the clouds ahead of the airplane and requested, and were approved, to deviate to the right to avoid the buildups.  During the turn, the captain made an announcement on the public address (PA) system for the FAs to 'take their jumpseatsâ and subsequently encountered 'a couple bumps of light chop.â  Almost immediately after, they received a call from the cabin, that the purser had been injured.   According to the FAs, they were preparing for cabin service when the turbulence was encountered. The forward FA fell to the floor as she was walking through the first-class cabin.  Subsequently, the flight crew's announcement for the 'flight attendants take your jump seatsâ came over the PA system.  The injured FA was assisted by medically qualified passengers and remained in a passenger seat for the remainder of the flight. Paramedics met the airplane at the gate and the FA was transported to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a fractured ankle. Post accident examination of the weather data determined that the turbulence was encountered when the airplane was flying over an area of general thunderstorms.  Cloud tops up to FL400 were located within 10 miles of the turbulence encounter but there were no pilot reports (PIREPs) in the vicinity indicating turbulence prior to the event.  There was a Center Weather Advisory current for the area for isolated thunderstorms, which was included in the flights weather briefing. Probable Cause: an encounter with convectively induced turbulence while overflying an area of known convective activity.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA20CA058 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA20CA058 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  22 March 2023 N1902U United Airlines 0 Houston-George Bush Intercontinental Airport, TX (IAH/KIAH) sub Tailstrike Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

The aircraft operated on a service from Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport, Russia. The flight was cleared for an approach to runway 36C at Antalya Airport. During the base leg of the approach, the autopilot and autothrottle were disengaged. The aircraft was further configured for landing and the approach was stabled at 1035 feet altitude, 3 nm and from the runway. When descending below 270 feet (about 100ft agl) the airspeed decreased below the approach speed of 122 kt to a value to 109 at 20 feet above the runway. The pitch was 5.5Â° nose-up and idle thrust was selected. Then the captain abruptly moved the sidestick fully forward, holding it there for 1.5 seconds and causing the nose to drop. Full power was added and its nose-gear struck the runway with a 2.64g impact. The Airbus bounced and the captain pulled the sidestick to execute a go-around. The aircraftÂs flight-control system switched to direct law, two inertial reference systems failed, and attitude indications disappeared from the captainÂs instruments. Although the flaps were partially retracted during the go-around, the undercarriage could not be retracted. Smoke entered the cockpit and the flight declared a Mayday. Subsequently a low pass was made over runway 36C so the Tower could assess the damage to the aircraft. Then a dual hydraulic failure occurred, and the fight again declared a Mayday. A left-hand visual approach was flown to runway 36C and the aircraft landed. The runway was vacated and the aircraft was then shut down. The airline only notified the Russian Interstate Aviation Committee on January 14, four days after the accident. Investigators believes that after the accident both the voice recorder (CVR) as well as the flight data recorder (FDR) were removed by RMS Technic in Antalya. The voice recorder was fitted to a second Airbus A321 (VP-BHN) flying the return service to Moscow. After arrival in Moscow, it was removed by another maintenance firm and transported back to RMS Technic in Antalya where the recorder was refitted to the original damaged A321, before the inquiry team arrived. The investigation is ongoing.METAR: 04:04 UTC / 07:04 local time: LTAI 100404Z 36018G29KT CAVOK 07/M06 Q1018 NOSIG RMK RWY18C 36021KT RWY36R 35018G29KT RWY18L 35018G30KT04:20 UTC / 07:20 local time: LTAI 100420Z 01014KT CAVOK 07/M06 Q1019 NOSIG RMK RWY18C 01016G27KT RWY36R 36014G26KT RWY18L 36016KT04:50 UTC / 07:50 local time: LTAI 100450Z 02016G26KT CAVOK 07/M06 Q1019 NOSIG RMK RWY18C 03012KT RWY36R 36016KT RWY18L 02012KTAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: airporthaber.com  @AshedShadow   Location  Images: photo (c) MAK; Antalya Airport (AYT); January 2020 photo (c) MAK; Antalya Airport (AYT); January 2020 photo (c) MAK; Antalya Airport (AYT); January 2020 photo (c) Dmitrii Ermakov; Saint Petersburg-Pulkovo Airport (LED/ULLI); 19 May 2018 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

In the cockpit, the PIC was in the left pilotâs seat as Pilot Monitoring, a trainee in the FO promotion training in the right pilotâs seat as Pilot Flying and the FO was in the observer seat. When reaching an altitude of 10,000 ft during the climb, the flight crew members confirmed that there were no clouds on the climb route, and turned off the seat belt sign in the cabin around 13:12 JST. After that, the aircraft continued to climb to the cruising altitude of FL320. After the seat belt sign was turned off, based on the weather information confirmed prior to their departure, the PIC anticipated the possibility that they might encounter turbulence during the climb, thus he was thinking of how to respond, such as promptly turning on the seat belt sign to have the cabin crew members seated, when detecting a sign of turbulence. On the other hand, in the cabin, after the seat belt sign was turned off, cabin crew members started selling duty-free goods and distributing immigration cards. The senior cabin crew member moved to the aft galley to take care of passengers.  Until reaching an altitude of about FL 250 after the seat belt sign was turned off, the aircraft had neither entered clouds nor encountered turbulence, and any sign of turbulence was not confirmed on the airborne weather radar and other instrument indications. However, around 13:17 immediately after reaching FL 250, the aircraft was strongly shaken all of sudden, therefore the PIC turned on the seat belt sign at once. At this time, the PIC instructed the cabin crew members to be seated promptly. When this shaking occurred, the purser in the center of the aft galley was standing facing forward of the cabin, but fell down to the right not being able to support herself. Afterward, being seated in her seat located near the aft galley, the purser confirmed that she had pain in her right ankle and suffered abrasions.  Turbulence ceased after reaching FL 270, and the flight reported to Fukuoka Air Traffic Control that they encountered turbulence.  The PIC then judged that it would be possible to fly to Incheon International Airport, their destination. The purser was diagnosed with a lateral malleolus fracture in her right ankle in a hospital in Seoul City.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: JTSB Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: JTSB  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates17-Jun-2024 10:54 ASN Updated [Category, ] Corrections or additions? ...

Tambo International Airport (JNB/FAOR)"," GCAA","Accident investigation report completed and information captured","Emirates Airlines flight EK764, an Airbus A380-861,  operated a scheduled passenger flight, EK763, from Dubai International Airport (OMDB), the United Arab Emirates, to Johannesburg Tambo International Airport (FAOR), Republic of South Africa. The Aircraft had 526 persons onboard, consisting of two flight crewmembers, 24 cabin crewmembers and 500 passengers. The commander, occupying the left seat, was the pilot flying (PF). He stated that prior to the turbulence encounter, the daylight flight was uneventful with no avoidance actions required due to weather. After entering BEIRA flight information region (FIR), Mozambique, at flight level (FL) FL400 close to waypoint OKBIM, the flight crew stated that there was light turbulence with the weather radar displaying that the weather was off-path on the navigation display (ND) and beneath the aircraft. Soon after, several magenta spots appeared on the weather radar along the flight path indicating that there were areas of wet turbulence within 40 nautical miles (NM) ahead of the aircraft. At 1314:24 UTC, approximately six hours after departure from OMDB, the aircraft experienced moderate to severe turbulence at FL400 within BEIRA FIR. The operational flight plan (OFP) significant aeronautical weather chart had forecast the occasional presence of convective weather activity containing embedded cumulonimbus clouds (CB) up to an altitude of 52,000 feet (ft) in this area. During the turbulence encounter, the Aircraft autopilot and autothrust remained engaged and there were no operational exceedances. The turbulence lasted for approximately 30 seconds and resulted in a serious leg injury to an unsecured passenger on the upper deck. There was no reported damage to the aircraft cabin. The commander decided to continue the flight to the destination as the passengerâs injury was non-life threatening and the aircraft performance was not affected. The remainder of the flight, lasting 1 hour 46 minutes, was uneventful. Causes The Air Accident Investigation Sector of the United Arab Emirates (AAIS) determines that the cause of the Accident was the severe turbulence of vertical gust forces imposed on the Aircraft as it operated within an area associated with wet turbulence cells, resulting in the forceful movement of unsecured passengers and cabin crewmembers. Contributing Factors The Investigation determines that the following were contributory factors to the Accident: (a) After entering BEIRA FIR and wet turbulence was detected by the weather radar turbulence function, the flight crew did not use the full capabilities of the weather radar to obtain an accurate assessment of the distance of the area of greatest threat from the Aircraft flight path. (b) There was insufficient time for the cabin crew to secure the cabin after the seat belt sign was turned ON.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: GCAA Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: GCAA Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

The airplane ended up 400 or 500 yards offshore in the waters of Unalaska Bay near Hog Island and sank. The three occupants were rescued. According to the pilot, after checking the weather on the Automated Weather Observing System (AWOS), he completed the before takeoff check list, back taxied for a runway 31 departure and initiated the takeoff roll. He said he recalled the winds being reported as 100Â° at 9 knots. As the airplane accelerated down the runway, he said the airspeed was about 75 knots at midfield and increasing. When the airspeed reached about 90 knots, he applied back pressure to the control yoke to initiate the takeoff and noted a brief positive rate of climb, followed by a sinking sensation. The airspeed rapidly decayed, and the stall warning horn sounded. In an effort to correct for the decaying airspeed, he lowered the nose and immediately noticed the airplane's lights reflecting off the surface of the water. He pulled back on the airplane's control yoke and leveled the wings just before impacting the ocean waters.  A tailwind takeoff was performed since IFR takeoff minimums and (obstacle) departure procedures only allow for night departures off of runway 31.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ANC20LA015 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: adn.com  kucb.org  Flightaware   Location  Images: photo (c) Bas Velders; Anchorage-Ted Stevens International Airport, AK (ANC/PANC); 07 April 2016 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft had departed MontrÃ©al-Pierre Elliott Trudeau Airport (CYUL) at 07:06 hours local time on a multi-stop flight to Salluit. The accident occurred on the second leg, from MontrÃ©al to Schefferville. Findings as to causes and contributing factors: 1. The pilots forgot to perform the descent checklist and realized this at an inopportune time, when the pilot monitoring was providing a position report. 2. Given the ambiguities and contradictions in the stabilized approach guidelines, the captain interpreted that he was allowed to continue the approach below 500 feet above aerodrome elevation although the flaps had not been set to 35Â° and the final checklist had not been completed. 3. Communicating with the flight attendant to confirm the cabin status and performing the descent checklist during final approach added to the pilotsÂ workload, which was already heavy. 4. The combination of the visual conditions and the plan continuation bias prompted the pilots to continue managing the height and speed deviations past the stabilized approach gate. 5. When the aircraft passed 500 feet above aerodrome elevation, the pilots, who were dealing with a heavy workload, passed the stabilized approach gate without noticing it and continued the approach, which was de facto unstable. 6. At the time of the flare, the aircraft no longer had enough energy to stop the rate of descent solely by increasing the pitch attitude. 7. The instinctive reaction to increase the pitch attitude, combined with the hard landing, resulted in the aft fuselage striking the runway, causing major damage to the aircraftÂs structure.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A20Q0013 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  9 February 2024 C-GXAI Air Inuit 0 Tasiujuaq Airport, QC (YTQ/CYTQ) min Collision with other aircraft on apron Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The three occupants were killed and the aircraft was destroyed. The Citation departed Port Elizabeth Airport (FAPE) on a positioning flight to George Airport (FAGG). On approach to FAGG, the flying crew requested to carry out a calibration flight for the very high frequency omnidirectional range (VOR) beacon at FAGG. Due to inclement weather conditions at the time, they were not cleared to conduct VOR calibration. As a result, they decided to land and refuel the aircraft before commencing with the calibration of the Instrument Landing System (ILS) on runway 11 at FAGG. The flying crew requested take-off from runway 11 and an early right turn to intercept radial 250Â°, 17 nautical miles (nm) DME arc to radial 330Â° at 3000 feet (ft) climbing to 4000ft. The air traffic control (ATC) granted their request. Radar data indicated that at 10:42, the aircraft took off from runway 11 and, once airborne, made a right-hand turn to intercept radial 250Â° using the George VOR (GRV VOR). The aircraft climbed to 3000ft. Once the aircraft reached 17nm on the DME from the GRV VOR (DME is co-located with the VOR), it commenced with a right-hand turn to intercept radial 330Â° while maintaining 17nm DME arc. At 10:46, the ATC at FAGG advised the flying crew that they were now exiting controlled airspace and were advised to broadcast on the special rules frequency. The crew acknowledged the advisory to change frequency and there was no further communication. The aircraft was still being monitored by ATC using secondary surveillance radar. At 10:50, radar data showed the aircraft crossing radial 310Â° and entered a climb from 3000ft, reaching 3900ft. As the aircraft levelled off at 3900ft, a rapid descent occurred, and the aircraft lost 1500ft in approximately 9 seconds. Three seconds prior to impact, the aircraft nose pitched up before impacting a ridge at 2192ft. Probable Cause: The crew lost control of the aircraft which resulted in significant loss of altitude; as they attempted to recover, they collided with the mountain. According to the SAWS report, there was significant cloud coverage below 1500 ft above ground level at the time of the accident as observed in the METARs. Mountain tops were obscured as seen on the Webcam. The aircraft route which is 17 N.M arc passes over the obscured mountains. From the limited FDR reading the aircraft attitude drastically changed into an unusual attitude when approaching the mountain area .This indicates that most probably, the pilot has entered into an unusual attitude during transition from VFR to IFR flight without preparation. The accident flight plan was VFR. Contributing Factors: 1. The presence of low clouds at about 1500ft below above ground and obscured mountains with clouds; 2. The incapability of the crew to recover from unusual attitude; lack of supervision and disregard of the Civil Aviation Regulations requirements by the FIU (operator). 3. Overbanked and steep dive maneuver, unable to gain the required altitude before impact; 4.

All three crew members died in the accident. The aircraft, contracted to the New South Wales Rural Fire Service, departed Richmond RAAF Base, Australia at 12:05 local time. The crew had been tasked with a fire retardant drop over the ÂAdaminaby ComplexÂ bush fire. After approaching the Adaminaby complex fire, the drop was unable to be completed and the aircraft was diverted to a secondary tasking, to drop retardant on the ÂGood GoodÂ fire. Witnesses reported seeing the aircraft complete a number of circuits, prior to completing the retardant drop. The drop was conducted on a heading of about 190Â°, at about 200 ft above ground level, with a drop time of approximately 2 seconds. The crew released about 1,200 US gallons (4,500 L) of fire retardant during the drop. Witness videos taken of the aircraft leading up to the accident showed a number of passes conducted at varying heights prior to the retardant drop. Following the retardant drop, the aircraft was observed to bank left, before becoming obscured by smoke after about 5 seconds. A further 15 seconds after this, the aircraft was seen flying at a very low height above the ground, in a left wing down attitude. Shortly after, at about 13:16, the aircraft collided with terrain and a post-impact fuel-fed fire ensued. The three crew were fatally injured and the aircraft was destroyed. Contributing factors: - Hazardous weather conditions were forecast and present at the drop site near Peak View, which included strong gusting winds and mountain wave activity, producing turbulence. These conditions were likely exacerbated by the fire and local terrain. - The Rural Fire Service continued the B134 tasking to Adaminaby when they learned that no other aircraft would continue to operate due to the environmental conditions. In addition, they relied on the pilot in command to assess the appropriateness of the tasking to Adaminaby without providing them all the available information to make an informed decision on flight safety. - The pilot in command of B134 accepted the Adaminaby fire-ground tasking, which was in an area of forecast mountain wave activity and severe turbulence. After assessing the conditions as unsuitable, the crew accepted an alternate tasking to continue to the Good Good (Peak View) fire-ground, which was subject to the same weather conditions. The acceptance of these taskings were consistent with company practices. - Following the partial retardant drop and left turn, the aircraft was very likely subjected to hazardous environmental conditions including low-level windshear and an increased tailwind component, which degraded the aircraftÂs climb performance. - While at a low height and airspeed, it was likely the aircraft aerodynamically stalled, leading to a collision with terrain. - Coulson Aviation's safety risk management processes did not adequately manage the risks associated with large air tanker operations. There were no operational risk assessments conducted or a risk register maintained. Further, as safety incident reports submitted were mainly related to maintenance issues, operational risks were less likely to be considered or monitored. Overall, this limited their ability to identify and implement mitigations to manage the risks associated with their aerial firefighting operations. (Safety issue) - Coulson Aviation did not provide a pre-flight risk assessment for their firefighting large air tanker crews. This would provide predefined criteria to ensure consistent and objective decision-making with accepting or rejecting tasks, including factors relating to crew, environment, aircraft and external pressures. (Safety issue) - The New South Wales Rural Fire Service had limited large air tanker policies and procedures for aerial supervision requirements and no procedures for deployment without aerial supervision. (Safety issue) - The New South Wales Rural Fire Service did not have a policy or procedures in place to manage task rejections, nor to communicate this information internally or to other pilots working in the same area of operation.

The pilot further reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation. Weather observations at TJIG were reported only when the air traffic control tower was open (0700 to 1900), and there were no automated weather observation stations at the airport. The last available observation occurred at 1745, which indicated that rain showers were in the vicinity of the airport to the southwest and northwest. Automated weather observations reported at the San Juan Luis Marin International Airport (TJSJ), located about 5 miles to the east of TJIG, included rain showers at that airport or in the vicinity for the 4 hours preceding the accident. At 2056, the conditions reported at TJSJ included heavy rain showers and mist. Probable Cause: ""The pilotÂs loss of control during landing on a wet runway after encountering standing water.""Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA20LA221 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) tjig-flyer; San Juan-Fernando Luis Ribas Dominicci Airport (SIG); 24 January 2020 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft, from 430th EECS, was outfitted with a Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) and operated as a communications-relay platform out of Kandahar Airport, Afghanistan. At the time of the accident the aircraft operated on a combat sortie as well as a Mission Qualification Training for the first officer. Takeoff occurred at 11:05 local time. The flight proceeded to the assigned orbit using standard departure/climb procedures. The crew assumed a circular orbit just west of Kabul at 42,000 feet altitude at about 11:36. At 12:50, the crew requested and was cleared by ATC to climb from 42,000 feet altitude to 43,000 feet altitude. The engine revolutions per minute (RPMs) advanced and the crew initiated the climb with the autopilot, gaining about 300 feet. At 12:50:52, a fan blade broke free and separated from the N1 first-stage turbofan of the left engine, causing major damage and resulting in the immediate shutdown of that engine by the Electronic Engine Controller (EEC), a subsystem of the Full Authority Digital Engine Controller (FADEC). This was accompanied by a bang. Simultaneous with the bang, the CVR recording stopped.  Within one to two seconds after the initial event, the autothrottles disengaged automatically. The autopilot was engaged and it remained engaged. Bank angles remained essentially constant, consistent with a circular orbit, and the aircraft descended from an altitude of 42,300 feet to 41,000 feet. Ten seconds after the catastrophic left engine failure, the crew retarded both throttles to just less than halfway (14 degrees; total throttle range is from 0 Â 40 degrees) for one second, then slightly advancing the left throttle separately (26 degrees) for one second, then retarding it to align with the right throttle (both at 16 degrees) for one second, and finally splitting the throttles to advance the left throttle (to 31 degrees) while retarding the right to idle (0 degrees). Nine seconds after moving the right throttle to idle, the crew placed the right engine run switch to off, shutting down the right engine. Finally, at 12:51:19, the left throttle was advanced to full power (40 degrees), briefly cycled then brought to idle. At 12:51:23, both throttles were advanced from idle to full power. It is likely the crewÂs first actions, including the shutdown, were hastened by a sense of urgency due to aircraft vibrations and other auditory/sensory cues, reinforced by the startle response. The crew announced to Kabul ATC that they had lost both engines and that they intended to proceed to Kandahar, which was well outside the E-11A glide capabilities. This intent suggests that the crew was confident of airstarting one or both engines. While the crew would have waited, in accordance with the checklist, to 30,000 feet to attempt an airstart, an airstart of the right engine should have been successful, whether accomplished with windmilling airspeed or with the assistance of the APU. However, airstarts of the left engine would have failed due to the original damage. There is no DFDR data to definitively confirm whether an engine airstart attempt was made. At 13:03:30, the crew announced to ATC that they were going to land at FOB Sharana. The aircraft continued to glide without engine power and was not able to reach Sharana. At approximately 13:09, the aircraft impacted the ground approximately 21 NM (39 km) short of Sharana, on a heading of roughly 140 degrees, consistent with a direct flight path towards Sharana. The terrain was unpopulated, largely flat, and covered in snow. The wings show the slats out and the flaps appear to be extended, suggesting that the aircraft had been configured for, and presumably slowed for, landing. It is likely that the crew attempted to make a forced landing. While the terrain was largely flat, the aircraft impacted berms and ditches, roughly estimated between 3-6 feet high. Weather at Sharana was reported to have 1000 foot ceilings, and pilot testimony confirms approximately 1000 foot ceilings in the vicinity of the accident site. Accordingly, the crew may have had less than a minute to maneuver after exiting the clouds and seeing the terrain. It appears that while the aircraft touched down, it impacted a smaller berm almost immediately, then more completely impacted the ground and skidded to a halt in approximately 340 meters. During this time the wings were ripped from the aircraft, and subsequently much of the cockpit and cabin were destroyed by fire. The Accident Investigation Board (AIB) President found by a preponderance of the evidence that the cause of the mishap was the MC's error in analyzing which engine had catastrophically failed (left engine). This error resulted in the MC's decision to shutdown the operable right engine creating a dual engine out emergency. The AIB President also found by a preponderance of the evidence that the MC's failure to airstart the right engine and their decision to recover the MA to KAF substantially contributed to the mishap.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: USAF AIB Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 9 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-recovers-two-killed-in-air-force-crash-in-taliban-territory-11580232907  https://www.airforcetimes.com/news/your-air-force/2021/01/21/broken-fan-blade-shutdown-of-wrong-engine-led-to-fatal-e-11-crash-in-afghanistan-report-says/  https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2020/01/27/us-army-investigating-plane-crash-in-taliban-held-area/  https://aerossurance.com/air-accidents-incidents/usaf-e11a-global-express-psmicr/  https://www.acc.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/2478327/e-11a-accident-investigation-board-report-released/  https://www.afjag.af.mil/Portals/77/AIB-Reports/2020/27JAN20%20ACC%20Bagram%20Airfield%20E-11%20AIB%20Report.pdf  Location  Images: photo (c) Bart Hoekstra; Mildenhall RAF Station (MHZ/EGUN); 11 March 2019 Media: Startled Shutdown - Fatal USAF E-11A Global Express PSM+ICR Accident: The crew shut down the serviceable engine and try to reach an airfield 230 NM away rather than ones close by. aerossurance.com/air-accident... #military #accident #flightsafety #aviationsafety #humanfactors[image or embed]— Aerossurance (@aerossurance.bsky.social) January 3, 2025 at 11:46 AMStartled Shutdown - Fatal USAF E-11A Global Express PSM+ICR Accident: The aircraft force lands in Afghanistan and burns out.  aerossurance.com/air-accident... #military #accident #flightsafety #aviationsafety #humanfactors[image or embed]— Aerossurance (@aerossurance.bsky.social) January 3, 2025 at 11:48 AMRevision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates30-Dec-2024 13:07 Aerossurance Updated [Source, ]31-Dec-2024 15:34 Aerossurance Updated [Source, ]31-Dec-2024 17:21 Aerossurance Updated [Operator, Source, Embed code, Narrative, ]01-Jan-2025 11:36 Aerossurance Updated [Narrative, ]02-Jan-2025 16:05 Aerossurance Updated [Source, ]03-Jan-2025 11:49 Aerossurance Updated [Embed code, ] Corrections or additions? ...

The aircraft stopped 90 meters beyond the paved end of the runway stopway in the middle of a road. All occupants safely evacuated the aircraft. The aircraft took off from Tehran-Mehrabad Airport at 06:24 hours local time and climbed to the cruising altitude of FL320. The flight was subsequently cleared direct to GODMO. After contacting the controller at Mahshahr the crew was informed: ""runway active is 31; wind is now 280/08kts, CAVOK, temperature +06, DP 04 and QNH 1023, expected VOR approach runway 31 via GODMO 1E Arrival"". The flight responded by requesting runway 13 for landing. ATC then cleared the flight for a VOR/DME approach to runway 13 using the GODMO 1F Arrival procedure. At 07:30:41 local time, the pilot reported over position GODMO at FL100. ATC replied: ""CPN 6936 yes sir; descend as profile to MNM 2000 feet for VOR/DME APP RWY 13, report when leaving IAF and cleared approach."" At 07:32:46, the pilot reported leaving the Initial Approach Fix (IAF) MNM. At that time the aircraft was flying at an altitude at 6647 ft instead of 2000 ft as required. The controller cleared the flight to land. As the aircraft passed 2500 ft, the autopilot was disengaged. Then the captain decided to control altitude and speed by executing an S-turn maneuver several times and continued in visual reference with the ground. At 07:35:29, at altitude 934 ft, the captain asked the copilot to set speed and the copilot called out the target airspeed of 135 knots when the actual speed (IAS) at the time was 196 kt.  Upon receiving EGPWS Sink Rate warnings, the copilot warned the pilot to read the landing checklist, but the captain did not accept this and accomplished an unstabilized high-speed approach for the purpose of landing.  The copilot claimed in his statement after the accident that: ""I wanted to take control of the aircraft and follow missed approach procedure but due to pilot over-confidence to overcome present situation and age gap, I disregarded it."" The captain was a 64-year old pilot with over 18000 flying hours, compared to the 28-year old copilot who had 300 hours. From 1000 ft until 10 ft altitude, sink rate and pull up warnings sounded in the cockpit successively. Finally, at 07:36:11, the aircraft landed with high speed (171 kt) after passing two-thirds of the runway. It touched down nosegear-first and bounced. Full auto thrust reversers and brakes were applied. The aircraft overran the runway, rolled through a non-paved area and airport perimeter fence, passed a shallow canal then onto an adjacent roadway, where it struck a concrete median strip and a lamp post before coming to a stop.  Runway 13 has a Landing Distance Available (LDA) of 8874 feet (2705 m). Probable Causes: The Aircraft Accident Investigation Board determines that the probable causes of this accident were the pilotsÂ failures below, resulting in a runway overrun: - Poor decision-making for acceptance of the risk of high-speed landing; - Un-stabilized approach against the normal flight profile; - Poor CRM in the cockpit; and - Poor judgment and not accomplishing go-around while performing an unstabilized approach. Contributing Factors: - Loading of 5 tons of extra fuel, which increased the landing distance required. - Decision to make a landing on RWY 13 with tailwind. - Inability of the copilot (PM) to take control of the aircraft and proper action to execute go-around.METAR: 03:00 UTC / 06:30 local time: OIAM 270300Z 29008KT 8000 NSC 06/04 Q102204:00 UTC / 07:30 local time: OIAM 270400Z 28006KT CAVOK 06/04 Q102305:00 UTC / 08:30 local time: OIAM 270500Z 29006KT 7000 NSC 07/05 Q1023Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: AAIB Iran Report number: A981107EPCPZ Status: Investigation completedDuration: 7 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: CAO Iran   Location  Images: photo (c) Mehr News, Ahmad Rostami; Bandar Mahshahr Airport (MRX/OIAM); 27 January 2020 photo (c) Mehr News, Ahmad Rostami; Bandar Mahshahr Airport (MRX/OIAM); 27 January 2020 photo (c) Mehr News, Ahmad Rostami; Bandar Mahshahr Airport (MRX/OIAM); 27 January 2020 photo (c) Mehr News, Ahmad Rostami; Bandar Mahshahr Airport (MRX/OIAM); 27 January 2020 photo (c) Mehr News, Ahmad Rostami; Bandar Mahshahr Airport (MRX/OIAM); 27 January 2020 photo (c) Mehr News, Ahmad Rostami; Bandar Mahshahr Airport (MRX/OIAM); 27 January 2020 photo (c) AAIB Iran; Bandar Mahshahr Airport (MRX); 27 January 2020 photo (c) Javidfa; Tehran-Mehrabad Airport (THR/OIII); 01 June 2017; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

It was snowing at the time of the accident.  During the landing roll on runway 33, the aircraft departed the cleared area of the runway to the left, contacted a windrow, travelled partially off the runway surface, returned to the runway and stopped. The damage to the aircraft included the nose wheel collapsing and damage to the right propeller blades. The aircraft was ferried to Kelowna on May 27 and resumed service after final repairs on June 10, 2020. Findings as to causes and contributing factors 1. Given the falling snow and the snow-covered runway, there were limited visual cues available to the flight crew, which decreased their ability to accurately judge the aircraftÂs lateral position once it was beyond the threshold. 2. Snow clearing operations cleared the centre 100 feet of the runway, which resulted in windrows that were approximately 18 inches high along the edges of the cleared area. This reduced the pilotÂs lateral manoeuvring room during the landing. 3. The aircraft initially touched down 10 feet left of the centreline due to control inputs and variable wind conditions and, while the aircraft was still in a light weight-on-wheels condition, a gust contributed to a further deviation to the left until the left main landing gear came into contact with the windrow. 4. As the left main landing gear impacted the windrow, the drag on that landing gear caused the aircraft to pull to the left, causing the nose and right main landing gear to also come into contact with the windrow. 5. During the runway excursion, snow and ice became packed in the nose landing gear bay and caused structural deformation. Consequently, the nose landing gear was no longer being held in place and collapsed rearward into the fuselage, causing substantial damage to the aircraft.METAR: 04:00 UTC / 20:00 local time: CYXT 010400Z 35015G24KT 3/4SM -SN VV003 00/M00 A2903 RMK SN8 /S05/ SLP84105:00 UTC / 21:00 local time: CYXT 010500Z 03009KT 3/4SM -SN VV003 00/M00 A2903 RMK SN8 SLP84105:23 UTC / 21:23 local time: CYXT 010523Z 02010KT 3/4SM -SN VV003 00/M00 A2903 RMK SN8 SLP83906:00 UTC / 22:00 local time: CYXT 010600Z 35009G15KT 1SM -SN OVC010 00/00 A2905 RMK SN5SC3 /S08/ PRESRR SLP848Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A20P0013 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: TSB A20P0013 History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  19 July 2019 C-FKWE WestJet Encore 0 Edmonton International Airport, AB (YEG) sub 4 September 2022 C-FKWE WestJet 0 25nm W of Moncton International Airport, NB (YQM/CYQM) unk Location  Images: photo (c) Leslie Snelleman; Vancouver International Airport, BC (YVR/CYVR); 27 May 2017 photo (c) RenÃ© Verschuur; Vancouver International Airport, BC (YVR/CYVR); 07 August 2015 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight had 361 persons onboard consisting of four flight crew, 24 cabin crew and 333 passengers. During cruise at flight level (FL) 330, in the airspace above Trout Peak, Rocky Mountains, Wyoming, the aircraft experienced moderate to severe turbulence at around 02:14 UTC, approximately 1 hour and 42 minutes after departure from KLAX.  The commander was the pilot flying. Because there was neither any significant weather in the area nor air traffic control reports of any turbulence, the commander had switched the seatbelt sign OFF after the aircraft had passed FL100 during the climb. The turbulence started just after the commander had initiated the climb to FL350 and he reacted by immediately turning the seatbelt sign ON and making a passenger announcement for cabin crew to take their seat. During the turbulence, which lasted for about one minute and 54 seconds. the aircraft airspeed increased but the maximum operating Mach (MMO) speed was not exceeded. The aircraft autopilot and autothrust remained engaged during the turbulence. The vertical speed of the aircraft varied between minus 580 feet per minute and positive 1,400 feet per minute with vertical gravitational g-loads between positive 0.44 G and positive 1.63 G. Amongst all persons onboard the aircraft, one passenger was injured which was classified as a serious injury. There was no reported damage to the aircraft cabin. The flight continued to the destination where the aircraft landed uneventfully. Causes The Air Accident Investigation Sector determines that the cause of the Accident was the acceleration forces imposed on the Aircraft as it flew through an area of clear air turbulence, which resulted in an unsecured passenger forcefully impacting cabin furnishings in the lavatory. Contributing Factors Lack of placarded instructions and inaccessibility of the handholds within the lavatory for use in case of turbulence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: GCAA Report number:  Status: Investigation completedDuration: Download report:  Final report Sources: GCAA Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

Of the 8 occupants onboard, the commercial pilot and six adult passengers, along with one infant passenger, were not injured.  Day instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident, and an instrument flight plan was filed. The flight originated from HPB, about 15:58, and was destined for Bethel, Alaska (BET). According to the captain, the weather conditions the day of the accident consisted of snow, low visibility, and flat light. The original flight departure time had been delayed about 3 hours due to weather. The scheduled route of flight was from Bethel (BET), to Scammon Bay (SCM), to HPB, to Chevak (VAK), returning to BET with various passengers and cargo pick-ups and drop-offs along the route. Prior to departure from BET he received runway reports from his dispatcher that all destination airport runways were ready. He also obtained weather at all three destinations. He then did a risk analysis and gathered more weather before deeming the flight conditions good to dispatch the flight. While enroute to HPB he gathered weather for VAK and determined that the VAK portion of the flight would be canceled due to deteriorating weather. Once in HPB he landed without incident on the snow covered runway. He then called Grant dispatch in BET and informed that he would take all the passengers going to BET since he had canceled his flight to VAK; he loaded 7 passengers total and their bags. During the time on the ground, while waiting for passengers, a twin-engine King Air airplane landed and departed the runway with no incident. The pilot then back taxied for a runway 13 departure at HPB. He stated that flat light conditions prevailed, and it was difficult to see down the runway or have any depth perception. He initiated the takeoff with 20 degrees of flap selected and noticed no issues during the initial takeoff roll. He then noticed the airspeed was not increasing fast enough, witnessed the end of the runway approaching, and decided he could not abort the takeoff in time. Committed to the takeoff the airplane became airborne and the stall warning horn activated as the airplane cleared the departure end of the runway. The pilot attempted to get the airplane into ground effect, but the airplane settled, and the main landing gear encountered the snow covered terrain. Subsequently, the airplane's speed decreased, the nose wheel descended and encountered the snow, and the airplane came to rest upright about 150 ft from the end of the runway. All crew and passengers evacuated the airplane, and nobody was injured. The pilot added that the snow on the runway during departure was about 3-5 inches of wet heavy snow. Probable Cause: The pilotÂs decision to depart from a contaminated runway, and his failure to make a timely decision to abort the takeoff when the airplane was not accelerating as expected. Contributing to the accident was the pilotÂs decision to depart in limited visibility conditions, which likely affected his ability to determine the available runway distance remaining during the takeoff.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ANC20LA020 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  24 February 2002 N454SF Grant Aviation 0 Tununak, Alaska sub 13 December 2005 N454SF Grant Aviation 0 Newtok, Alaska sub Runway excursion 15 January 2008 N454SF Grant Aviation 0 Bethel, Alaska sub Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were 183 occupants on the aircraft. Three passengers died, the remaining 180 occupants were injured. The aircraft departed Izmir Airport at 17:22 hours. At the time the flight arrived in the vicinity of  Istanbul-Sabiha GÃ¶kÃ§en Airport, a thunderstorm was passing. Runway in use was 06. About 18:17 the Tower controller cleared another flight for takeoff from runway 06, reporting wind 300 degrees at 11 knots, gusting to 21 knots. The subsequent arrival was flight 2193, which was cleared to land with wind information given as 270 degrees at 22 knots, gusting to 30 knots. This translates to a 19 knot tailwind. Since the wind was shifting the controller reported to a flight on the ground that it was to expect a runway change for departure. At 18:19 Pegasus 2193 touched down, but failed to come to a complete stop on the runway. It overran and went down an embankment, breaking in three. The aircraft came to rest about 30 m below runway elevation. Data from flight tracking website Flightradar24 suggest that the aircraft was steered to the left at the end of the runway, likely as there was an antenna array just past the stopway. The last recorded ground speed was 63 knots as the aircraft crossed the perimeter road. Runway 06 is a concrete runway with a Landing Distance Available (LDA) of 3000 m. At the runway end there is a 65 m long stopway, followed by antenna array, perimeter road and a downslope. In March 2020 Turkish media reported on a preliminary report, issued by authorities. According to this report the aircraft was struck by lightning six minutes before landing. During the approach one of the preceding aircraft reported a sudden tailwind of 37 knots below 600 feet. This report was communicated in Turkish by the Tower controller. The Dutch first officer, who was Pilot Monitoring, did not understand this. Subsequent clearances and weather information were in English. After touchdown the speedbrake and autobrake activated. The thrust reversers were selected manually. After passing taxiway F at an airspeed of 57 knots, the speed brake and thrust reverser were switched off. The ground speed was reported to be 84 knots due to the effect of the wind. Six seconds later manual braking was resumed. The aircraft failed to stop on the runway, hit ILS antennas and a small building before it fell 30 m down the embankment.METAR: 14:50 UTC / 17:50 local time: LTFJ 051450Z VRB08G18KT 9999 -SHRA FEW025CB BKN036 BKN070 12/09 Q0990 NOSIG RMK RWY24 04009KT15:20 UTC / 18:20 local time: LTFJ 051520Z 29022G37KT 240V330 7000 -TSRA FEW017CB BKN025 BKN070 11/09 Q0992 RESHRA NOSIG RMK RWY24 33010G20KT 270V360 Sources: CNN TÃ¼rk  Airporthaber  Luchtvaartnieuws.nl   Location  Images: photo (c) Anna Zvereva; Istanbul-AtatÃ¼rk Airport (ISL/LTBA); 27 September 2018; (CC:by-sa) photo (c) Miklos Szabo; Istanbul-AtatÃ¼rk Airport (ISL/LTBA); 19 June 2018; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates17-Oct-2024 17:30 ASN Updated [Cn, ]02-Jan-2025 10:58 ASN Updated [Narrative, ] The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Of the 73 passengers and crew onboard, one flight attendant received serious injuries and there were 22 minor injuries. The airplane sustained minor damage. The regularly scheduled domestic passenger flight was operating under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 from Charlotte Douglas International Airport (KCLT), Charlotte, North Carolina, to KTYS. The accident flight departed 4 hours late due to the late arrival of the inbound airplane in KCLT because of persistent severe weather that had been in the area. According to the flight crew, they kept the seatbelt sign illuminated for the entire flight because of the late night and weather in the area. They indicated that the takeoff, climb, and cruise were uneventful. Most of the flight was conducted at flight level (FL) 220 in clear air, with clouds beneath.  As they approached KTYS, the flight was cleared to descend at pilot's discretion to 13,000 feet. During the descent, the onboard radar was on but did not depict any precipitation in the cloud layer below them. In the early stages of the descent, the flight began entering and exiting various cloud layers and experienced very light/intermittent chop. At about FL 185, the flight went into a cloud and encountered severe turbulence, causing the autopilot to disengage and the airplane pitched nose down rapidly. The pilot flying reduced power, leveled the wings, and the airplane quickly exited the clouds into visual meteorological (VMC) conditions again. The flight continued to experience moderate turbulence during the descent.  The captain called back to check on the flight attendants (FA) and passengers but initially received no reply. A short time later, the captain called back again and was informed by a dead-heading flight attendant (FA) that both FAs had been injured.  At the time of the turbulence encounter, the forward FA was preparing the galley for landing and was thrown to the ceiling and back to the floor, injuring both ankles. The FA could not stand, and a dead-heading pilot helped her to a passenger seat.  The aft FA was conducting final compliance checks in the cabin and was also thrown to the ceiling and back to the floor, causing her to black out for a short time. Multiple passengers received various injuries, that included head bumps/bruises, scrapes, and anxiety issues. Two dead-heading FAs assumed the duties of the two injured FAs for the remainder of the flight. After landing, paramedics met the airplane at the gate and the two FAs and several passengers were transported to the hospital.  The forward FA was diagnosed with fractures in both ankles. Post accident examination of the weather data determined that the turbulence encounter occurred in a strong sheared environment with a 155-knot jet stream. There were several pilot reports (PIREPs) of moderate to severe turbulence in the area, and there was a National Weather Service SIGMET current for severe turbulence in the area. Probable Cause: An encounter with severe convective turbulence associated with a strong sheared environment associated with the jet stream.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA20CA071 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: NTSB DCA20CA071  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

The pilot was utilizing the autopilot for the approach and disengaged it when he had the runway and airport lighting system in view. As he approached the runway, the pilot heard a sound and thought the airplane had hit a bird. He felt the airplane pitch up so he increased engine power and pitched down in order to reach the runway. After the pilot landed and taxied to the ramp, he saw that a large piece of an approach light was caught on the airplane's right main landing gear.

The operator reported that the airplane had struck four separate approach light towers as well as a localizer antenna. Probable cause: ""The pilot's failure to maintain clearance from the approach lights during an instrument approach.""METAR: 08:54 UTC / 03:54 local time: KBWI 070854Z 00000KT 1/8SM R10/1600V1800FT FG VV002 08/07 A2915 RMK AO2 SLP871 60004 T00780067 5805510:18 UTC / 05:18 local time: KBWI 071018Z 15011G19KT 5SM BR OVC005 13/12 A2906 RMK AO2 PRESFR T01330122Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA20CA095 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 6 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) NTSB; Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport, MD (BWI); February 2020; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport, MD (BWI); February 2020; (publicdomain) photo (c) NTSB; Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport, MD (BWI); February 2020; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were no injuries among the 166 passengers. The captain on the flight from Berlin Tegel Airport was the Pilot Flying (PF). The flight had been uneventful, although the flight crew was aware of unfavourable weather conditions in Keflavik with winds around 40 knots, gusting to 53-56 knots. Flight 529 was cleared direct to NONBO by Keflavik Approach. The captain briefed his intentions to land a bit further down the runway than normal (3 white and 1 red on the PAPI), to avoid turbulence on short final. When the airplane reached NONBO, it intercepted the localizer and the ILS was followed down towards runway 10. The airplane encountered considerable turbulence at 1000 feet above MSL. The autopilot was disengaged between 600 and 700 feet above MSL and the airplane was then manually flown down towards the runway. The airplane was flown with the nose into the wind on final approach due to crosswind conditions. Few seconds before touchdown the airplane was de-crabbed to line up with the runway heading. The flare was normal and the airplane initially touched down on its right main landing gear. Then the left main landing gear touched the runway. Almost immediately thereafter, as the nose was gradually coming down, abnormal sound was observed and the right side of the airplane sunk down. The airplane speedbrake deployed momentarily and the right engine hit the runway. The airplane then leveled off again and the nose landing gear touched the runway. The airplane wobbled as it continued down the runway, on the left main landing gear and the nose landing gear only, as the PF fought to keep the airplane level and centered on the runway, utilizing the aileron and rudder controls. As the airplane speed decreased, the aerodynamics of the wings and the effectiveness of the rudder and aileron control diminished, until the PF could no longer keep the airplane wings level. The right wing sunk down again and the right engine hit the runway again. The airplane skid on the runway until it came to stop, still on the runway but with a magnetic heading of 115Â°.  During the on-site investigation it became clear that the nut used to fasten the swivel in the lug position on the main landing gear shock strut was missing along with its mating washer-splined. These parts were found on the runway where the touchdown occurred. Further investigation showed that the swivel threads were undersized 1/16 inch during an overhaul in December 2008. The SWIVEL threads were then undersized again during an overhaul in November 2019, bringing it to 1/8 inch undersize. Such an undersize was allowed but required a special 1/8 undersized nut to be fabricated and used. However, the nut on TF-FIA was found to be too large.METAR: 15:00 UTC / 15:00 local time: BIKF 071500Z 13040G53KT 5000 -DZRA BR OVC010 07/06 Q096815:30 UTC / 15:30 local time: BIKF 071530Z 13042G56KT 6000 BR OVC013 07/06 Q096716:00 UTC / 16:00 local time: BIKF 071600Z 13042G55KT 8000 BR OVC013 07/06 Q0966Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: RNSA Report number: 20-014F001 Status: Preliminary reportDuration: Download report:  Preliminary report Sources: ruv.is  visir.is  mbl.is History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  7 April 2015 TF-FIA Icelandair FlugfÃ©lag Islands 0 ReykjavÃ­k-KeflavÃ­k International Airport (KEF) min Lightningstrike Location  Images: photo (c) Harro Ranter / ASN; Billund Airport (BLL/EKBI); 07 May 2011 photo (c) Miklos Szabo; KeflavÃ­k International Airport (KEF/BIKF); 06 May 2017 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

All four occupants were fatally injured.  According to flight plan information, the accident flight was scheduled to depart at 09:30 from Atlanta-Peachtree Airport and arrive at Nashville-John C. Tune Airport, Tennessee around 10:22. Then, another flight plan was filed back to Peachtree Airport departing at 10:30 and arriving around 11:19. In addition, the flight plan noted in the remarks section that the flight was a ""training flight."" The pilot in command, seated in the right seat, among others held a flight instructor certificate. He was also type rated in the Cessna 500.  The second in command, seated in the left seat, held a private pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single-engine land and instrument airplane. The pilot was scheduled to attend flight training to obtain a Cessna 500 type rating. After departure the controller issued local weather information and instructed the pilots to climb to 7,000 ft mean sea level (msl). The controller issued the pilots a pilot report (PIREP) for trace to light rime icing between 9,000 ft and 11,000 ft, and one of the pilots acknowledged. Then, the controller instructed the pilots to climb to 10,000 ft and to turn right to 020Â°. The controller observed the airplane on a northwest bound heading and asked the pilots to verify their heading. A pilot responded that they were returning to a 320Â° heading, to which the controller instructed him to maintain 10,000 ft. The controller asked the pilots if everything was alright, and a pilot responded that they had a problem with the autopilot. The controller instructed the pilots to again maintain 10,000 ft and to advise when they were able to accept a turn. The controller again asked if everything was alright or if they needed assistance; however, neither pilot responded. The controller again asked the pilots if everything was under control and if they required assistance, to which one of the pilots replied that they were ""OK now."" The airplane climbed to 10,500 ft and the controller instructed the pilots to maintain 10,000 ft and again asked if everything was under control. A pilot responded in the affirmative and stated that they were ""playing with the autopilot"" because they were having trouble with it, and the controller suggested that they turn off the autopilot and hand-fly the airplane. The airplane descended to 9,000 ft and the controller instructed the pilots to maintain 10,000 ft and asked them if they could return to the departure airport to resolve the issues. One of the pilots requested a higher altitude to get into visual flight rules (VFR) conditions, and the controller instructed him to climb to 12,000 ft, advised that other aircraft reported still being in the clouds at 17,000 ft, and asked their intentions. The pilot requested to continue to their destination and the controller instructed him to climb to 13,000 ft. One of the pilots established communication with another controller at 11,500 ft and stated they were climbing to 13,000 ft on a 360Â° heading. The controller instructed the pilot to climb to 16,000 ft and inquired if their navigation issues were corrected. A pilot advised the controller that they had problems with the left side attitude indicator and that they were working off the right side. The controller cleared the airplane direct to the destination airport and asked if they were above the clouds as they were climbing through 15,400 ft. The airplane then began a left turn and soon after radar contact was lost at 10:13.  The main wreckage of the airplane was located around 1330 on the day of the accident. It came to rest in a wooded area, inverted, and partially submerged in a creek at an elevation of 703 ft mean sea level. Several parts of the airplane were not located in the vicinity of the main wreckage but were in the wooded area surrounding the main wreckage, consistent with an inflight breakup. The debris path was about 7,000 ft long on a 005Â° heading. Probable Cause: The pilotsÂ loss of control in flight in freezing instrument meteorological conditions due to spatial disorientation and the cumulative effects of task saturation.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA20FA096 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 3 years and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: FAA  Flightaware tracklog  WSBTV   Location  Images: photo (c) Niall Moran; unknown; 18 April 2017; (CC:by-nc-sa) photo (c) Brian Gore; Atlanta-DeKalb Peachtree Airport, GA (PDK/KPDK); 08 October 2015 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The aircraft took off from Moscow's Vnukovo Airport at 06:59 UTC and landed at Usinsk about 09:20 UTC (12:20 LT). It touched down in the snow, 32 meters short of the threshold of runway 13. The aircraft the it a snow bank, causing the main landing gears to separate. The aircraft slid down the runway and came to rest on the edge, perpendicular to the runway. All occupants evacuated the aircraft safely. The accident with the Boeing 737-500 VQ-BPS aircraft occurred during the landing as a result of a collision of the aircraft with a snow parapet 1.1 m high at a distance of 32 m to the runway threshold (within the paved section of the runway), which resulted in damage to the main landing gear and their subsequent ""folding"" in the process of moving along the runway. The accident was caused by a combination of the following factors: - the presence of contradictions in the Federal Aviation Rules for flights in the airspace of the Russian Federation, the airline's radio control system and the aircraft operational documentation regarding the need and procedure for introducing temperature corrections to the readings of barometric altimeters at low ambient temperatures; - Failure by the operator of the Usinsk aerodrome to comply with the FAP-262 requirements for the maintenance of the aerodrome, which resulted in the presence of snow parapets on the paved section of the landing strip; - the operator of the Usinsk aerodrome did not eliminate the shortcomings in the winter maintenance of the aerodrome, noted based on the results of the inspection by the Rosaviatsia commission on January 22, 2020; - lack of risk assessment in the airline associated with the execution of approaches in the baro-VNAV mode in the presence of factors that impede such approaches (low ambient temperatures, snow-covered underlying surface, drifting snow (snowstorm), significant changes in the relief in front of the runway end, lack of PAPI-type lights), as well as appropriate recommendations to the crews on the specifics of such approaches, including after the transition to visual flight, and crew training; - insufficient assessment by the crew during the preparation of the existing threats (hazard factors) and making an insufficiently substantiated decision to perform an RNAV (GNSS) approach (under the control of the autopilot in LNAV/VNAV mode) without introducing a correction for low outside air temperature in altitude overflying waypoints, which led to a flight below the established glide path; - performing a flight along the ""extended glide path"" after turning off the autopilot and switching to manual piloting without attempting to enter the set glide path; - the PIC may have had a visual illusion of a ""high glide path"" due to a snow-covered underlying surface, a snowstorm and the presence of a ravine directly in front of the runway end in the absence of PAPI type lights, which led to an incorrect assessment of the aircraft's flight altitude after switching to manual piloting, lack of reaction to timely and correct warnings of the co-pilot and exit to the runway end at a height significantly less than the established one.METAR: 05:30 UTC / 08:30 local time: METAR UUYS 090530Z 17006MPS 9000 Â SG OVC007 M24/M26 Q1003 R13/490534 NOSIG RMK QFE744/0993=Wind 170 at 6 mps; 9000 m visibility, 700 ft overcast, temperature: -24Â°C09:10 UTC / 12:10 local time: SPECI UUYS 090910Z 17006G11MPS 1500 SN BLSN BKN015 M21/M23 Q0999 R13/390238 TEMPO 1000 SN BLSN RMK QFE741/0989=Wind 170 at 6, gusting to 11 mps; 1500 m visibility in snow and blowing snow, broken clouds at 1500 ft, temperature: -21Â°CAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: MAK Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: Ren.tv   Location  Images: photo (c) MAK; Usinsk Airport (USK); 09 February 2020 photo (c) Anna Zvereva; Saint Petersburg-Pulkovo Airport (LED/ULLI); 10 September 2016; (CC:by-sa) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot and the one passenger were not injured.  The airplane was climbing through flight level (FL) 225 for FL 380, when the pilot heard a ""loud crashing noise"" followed by a ""turbulent air sound"" he described as similar to flying with the main landing gear extended. At time of the initial noise, the pilot reported the airplane was on a heading of 255, the airspeed was about 265 to 270 kts, and the autopilot system was engaged. The autopilot system was set to lateral navigation and the vertical speed was set for 1,500 ft per minute for climbing.  The pilot reacted to the initial noise by disconnecting the autopilot system, announcing the issue to air traffic control (ATC), slowing down the airplane to 170 kts, and descending to 11,000 ft above mean sea level. There were no master caution or warning lights illuminated on the cockpit annunciation panel. The pilot initially thought the airplane had a main landing gear malfunction based of the sound of the airflow around the cabin. The pilot slowed the airplane further, cycled the main landing gear, cycled the flaps, and moved the flight controls. He reported everything checked out normal except the ""turbulent air sound"" which was exacerbated with rudder movement. The pilot decided the main landing gear was functioning normally and there was a problem with the empennage. The pilot located the closest airport with a paved runway greater than a 5,000 ft length, contacted ATC, and proceeded to land at the Mineral Wells Airport (MWL), Texas. The pilot executed an uneventful landing at 15:45 and shutdown the airplane without further incident.  A post landing inspection revealed the top and bottom cowling for the number 2 (right) engine were missing. A portion of the separated cowlings was found wrapped around the inboard section of the right horizontal stabilizer. A portion of the separated cowlings impacted the area between the leading edge of the vertical stabilizer and the top of the fuselage, resulting in substantial damage. The remaining pieces of the separated cowlings have not been recovered.  On-scene examination revealed that receptacle 29, at the forward inboard side of the lower cowl door, was missing its stud, snap ring, and grommet and that receptacles 26 and 28 were missing their grommets and snap rings but had retained their studs. The most likely cause of the cowl door departure is that either the stud at receptacle 29 was left unlocked when the cowl door was attached, or an oversized stud was used at receptacle 29 that was able to rotate from the locked to unlocked position. Without the stud to examine and additional on-wing testing, it cannot be determined whether the stud at that location was a longer grip-length stud or if spontaneous unlocking of a longer grip-length stud is an actual possibility. The reason for the separation of the cowlings could not be determined because the stud in question was not recovered. Probable Cause: The in-flight separation of the upper and lower right engine cowlings for reasons that could not be determined based on available evidence.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN20LA082 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years and 3 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) FAA; Benbrook, TX; February 2020 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were 11 persons on board the aircraft; 2 pilots and 9 passengers. The pilot flying the aircraft was undergoing route and airstrip training. He was occupying the left seat and was Pilot Under Instruction (PUI). The pilot in the right seat was the instructor pilot for MAF conducting route and airstrip training for the new pilot. The pilot crossed overhead of the airstrip for an inspection of the surface and wind conditions. The crew did not observe any standing water or any wet areas on the strip. They also reported that the windsock indicated calm winds and the strip was clear. The aircraft joined mid-downwind less than half a nautical mile from the airstrip and tracked North West, descending from 1200 ft to 1000 ft before turning onto base. The aircraft began descending as it turned to line up on the final approach profile. There was a tailwind component of 5-12 kt on base and final. The aircraft overshot the turn onto final approach, 1.8 nm from the threshold at 900 ft. The pilot established the aircraft on the approach profile 1 nm from the threshold and at about 500 ft. The instructor stated that during final approach, the aircraft had descended below the normal approach profile causing him to instruct the pilot to adjust power and aim point to get back onto the correct profile. The pilot commenced the flare just under 20 ft AGL, 78 kt (85 kt ground speed). The aircraft touched down with an airspeed of 77 kt (82 kt ground speed) 36 m past the runway 11 threshold. The pilot stated that a few seconds after touchdown, he applied reverse thrust and the aircraft veered left. According to tyre track approximations, the aircraft appeared to have deviated about 220 m up-strip from threshold. The pilot stated that he applied full right rudder in an attempt to turn the aircraft back towards the center of the strip. The aircraft turned back to the right and rolled parallel to the centerline for another 100 m before it swerved left again, diverging at a 30Â° angle from the centerline. It rolled for 60 m as it bogged into the soft ground. The propeller blades subsequently struck the ground and the aircraft turned sharply left causing it to tip onto its starboard side. The crew reported that there were no injuries sustained during the accident and subsequent evacuation. Causes [Contributing factors] Onlanding,the PUI applied reverse thrust and the aircraft veered left of the centerline. Rudder was applied to get the aircraft back onto centerline, however, the rudder was not effective to counter the effect of reverse thrust as the left wheel entered in a softened area of the strip surface, which resulted in the aircraft being unable to regain the centerline as the landing roll progressed. The PUI did not effectively manage the effect of torque to maintain centerline during the landing roll.

The pilot and two passengers were fatally injured, and the airplane was destroyed. The airplane was registered to TLC Air, LLC and operated by Lauren Engineers & Constructors, Inc.  The airplane was cleared for takeoff from runway 35L at Abilene Regional Airport, Texas. Shortly afterwards the pilot was instructed to climb to 12,000 ft and was then cleared to climb to FL230. The pilot reported to the controller that they encountered freezing drizzle and light rime icing on the climb from 6,400 ft to 8,000 ft. As the airplane climbed through 11,600 ft, the pilot reported that they were having an issue with faulty deicing equipment and needed to return to the airport. The controller instructed the pilot to descend to 11,000 ft and cleared them direct to Abilene Airport. The flight was then instructed to descend to 7,000 ft and asked if there was an emergency. The pilot responded in the negative and stated that they blew a breaker when they encountered icing conditions, and that it was not resetting. The controller then instructed the pilot to descend to 5,000 ft and to expect the ILS runway 35R approach. The controller then instructed the pilot to turn to a heading of 310. Shortly afterwards the controller asked the pilot if they were turning to the assigned heading; the pilot responded that they were having issues with faulty instruments. When controller asked the aircraft to report their altitude, the pilot reported that they were at 4,700 ft. The controller then instructed the pilot to maintain 5,000 ft. The pilot responded he was ""pulling up"". There was no further communication with the pilot. Preliminary review of the airplane's radar track showed the airplane's departure from ABI and the subsequent turn and southeast track towards its destination. The track appeared as a straight line before a right turn was observed. The turn radius decreased before the flight track disappeared. The airplane impacted terrain in a right wing low attitude, followed by the right engine, then left engine. The wreckage path was on an initial heading of 320Â°, and continued for about 570 ft. The wreckage was highly fragmented and spread-out along the wreckage path. Probable Cause: ""The pilotÂs loss of airplane control due to spatial disorientation.

During the final descent into CYYC, the flight crew selected flaps 20 and immediately received a flaps fail caution message. The decision was made to abandon the approach, and the crew received clearance from ATC to proceed NW of the CYYC airport and troubleshoot the issue. The crew executed the applicable QRH procedure and subsequently received clearance from ATC to proceed with the landing. A flaps 0 landing was then executed. During the landing roll, after ground spoiler and thrust reverser deployment, the nose of the aircraft attained a significant nose high attitude. The rear fuselage of the aircraft struck the runway, and during the recovery, the nose landing gear subsequently impacted the runway. The aircraft taxied clear of the runway and to the intended parking area. Subsequent inspection revealed that the aircraft sustained significant structural damage to the forward fuselage and minor damage to the rear fuselage. There were no injuries. Findings as to causes and contributing factors 1. Moisture entered the flap flexible drive shaft casing, likely through the undetected puncture holes and the drive shaft casing to flap actuator interface, which led to the subsequent corrosion and failure of the inner drive shaft. 2. As the occurrence aircraftÂs actual annual utilization was approximately half of that expected by the manufacturer, the calendar time interval between maintenance inspections increased. As a result, the corrosion that developed was not detected because the shaft had not yet reached the 2400 flight-hour maintenance interval. 3. The Challenger 605 flight simulator used for recurrent training did not accurately represent the zero-flap handling characteristics of the aircraft when the thrust reversers are deployed, nor was it required for certification. As a result, the flight crew was inadequately prepared to prevent, or recover from, the nose pitch-up that occurred when the thrust reversers were deployed. 4. The pilot monitoring did not read the cautions included on the flaps fail checklist out loud to the pilot flying during the completion of the Quick Reference Handbook procedure. As a result, information critical to the safe operation of the aircraft was not brought to the pilot flyingÂs attention. 5. Insufficient pressure was applied to the control column to maintain the nose on the runway while using maximum reverse thrust; as a result, the nose pitched up, the aft fuselage contacted the runway, and the aircraft transitioned to a partial weight-off-wheels state. 6. When the left main wheel left the runway surface and the angle of attack reached 28.9Â°, the stick pusher activated and commanded a rapid nose-down pitch input. As a result of this rapid nose-down pitch, the forward section of the aircraft was damaged when the nose wheel contacted the runway.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A20W0016 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: TSB A20W0016   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The flight was conducted in accordance with the Visual Flight Rules (VFR). There were fifteen passengers, two pilots and one cabin crew onboard the aircraft. The accident occurred during landing on the water aerodrome at Kuredu Island Resort. At the time of the accident the water aerodrome was experiencing squally winds and rough seas under sunny conditions, common during the north east monsoon that is typical to the time of the year. The aircraft, while landing on one of the designated (but unmarked) water runways, touched down and bounced. After the bounce, the aircraft banked to the left dipping the left wing-tip into the water and the aircraft veered to the left. The right wing of the aircraft then abruptly dropped with the aircraft nose digging into the water. The captain attempted to initiate a go around after the bounce without success. During the accident the fuselage, wings, engines and propellers of the aircraft sustained substantial damage. Both the floats remained intact and the aircraft was upright after the accident. The aircraft taxied to the mooring buoy using the left engine power and assistance by a dinghy. All passengers and crew were able to evacuate safely. However, as a direct consequence of the accident, two of the operating crew and one passenger suffered minor injuries. Causes: Power was added on approach at around 100 to 150 ft.

As the aircraft started the takeoff roll on runway 12, the aircraft directional control was lost and the aircraft exited the right side of the runway. The propellers subsequently contacted a snow bank and broke apart. Parts of the broken propellers penetrated the fuselage, injuring 1 passenger. The aircraft was substantially damaged. A similar accident occurred to a Skylink Charter Metro III on 29 September 2002. The aircraft, N343AE, veered off the runway on takeoff from Hawthorne Airport, California because one of the propellers was not out of the start lock. Findings as to causes and contributing factors 1. While the crew was carrying out the ""Before Taxi"" checklist, the ""Start Locks"" task was initiated; however, it was interrupted and not completed. 2. After the captain told the first officer to stand by, the crewÂs focus shifted to other tasks. It is likely that this slip of attention resulted in the power levers not being pulled over the flight idle gate to release the start locks. 3. The ""Before Taxi"" checklist did not contain a task to ensure that the start locks were removed and, as a result, the crew began taxiing unaware that the propellers were still on the locks. 4. After the engine was started or while the occurrence aircraft commenced taxiing for departure, it is likely that slight or rapid transient movements of the engine power levers, which were needed to taxi the aircraft, resulted in the release of the left propeller start locks while the right propeller start locks remained engaged. 5. As the power was advanced through 20%, the ""positive torque"" call required by standard operating procedures was not made, and the engine torque differential was not noticed by the crew. As a result, power lever advancement continued although the right engine torque/thrust remained near zero. 6. The engaged start locks on the right propeller prevented forward thrust, which resulted in a significant thrust differential. This differential thrust during the take-off roll resulted in a loss of directional control of the aircraft and, ultimately, a lateral runway excursion. 7. Following the runway excursion, the propellers, which were operating at a high rpm, shattered and splintered when they struck a frozen snowbank. 8. High-energy release of the nickel-cobalt erosion strips and splintered wood core debris from the propeller blades penetrated the reinforcement panel, fuselage skin and cabin wall, and resulted in serious injuries to a passenger sitting next to the penetrated cabin wallAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A20C0016 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: 29 Sept. 2002 Skylink Charter Metro III accident - same cause  TSB   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

At 07:48 local time, the controller issued takeoff clearance.  During takeoff roll, about 2 seconds after the PM called the aircraft speed of 80 knots, the pilots felt aircraft vibration, which became severe as the aircraft speed increased. When the aircraft speed was about 110 knots, the PF decided to reject the takeoff and felt that the aircraft direction could not be controlled and the braking was ineffective. The aircraft skidded longitudinally with the nose headed to the right. Thereafter, the aircraft veered to the right and continued until it went off the side of the runway. The aircraft was still moving on the right of the runway shoulder with the nose headed on the runway heading.

There were five crewmembers onboard comprising the captain, the copilot and the flight engineer on the flight deck, together with a loadmaster and an aircraft engineer who were seated in the galley area. The flight was uneventful and the Aircraft landed at 08:45 UTC at HSSJ. Prior to departure, after one hour and 35 minutes on the ground, the captain and the aircraft engineer completed the transit check. The captain noticed oil dripping from the lower fuselage. The aircraft engineer advised the captain that four days before the green hydraulic system tank had been replaced and that the oil was most likely residue from this maintenance action. He assured the captain that the aircraft would be cleaned on arrival in Sharjah. The aircraft departed HSSJ at 10:20 UTC for OMSJ. The departure and flight were uneventful until when at FL350 in the Muscat flight information region (FIR), the captain requested a flight level change due to moderate turbulence. According to his statement, immediately after starting the descent, he received a report from the flight engineer that the fluid level in the yellow hydraulic system had rapidly decreased and the ""HYDRAU"" light had illuminated on the master warning panel, followed by an autopilot disconnect.  The checklist items for the hydraulic system loss from the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) were followed and the flight continued manually with the captain as the pilot flying (PF). According to the captain, Air Traffic Control (ATC) was not informed of the hydraulic system loss, but that the flight crew prepared for an extended landing distance of 1.2 times the normal landing distance. The aircraft landed at 15:15 UTC at OMSJ on runway 30 and exited on the high-speed taxiway B7. The captain stated that the descent, approach, landing and taxiing to the cargo apron were uneventful, and that the brakes functioned normally. The captain followed the marshallerÂs instructions and stopped the aircraft at the assigned A300 position mark on parking stand 57, in front of the cargo hangar. The captain stated that once the aircraft came to a stop, he applied manual brakes and set the parking brake. While the crew started the parking checklist, the copilot prepared to shut the engines down. When the captain looked up, he realized that the aircraft was moving forward and he applied manual brakes but the aircraft did not stop. He stated that he then steered to the left to avoid the cargo hangar in front of the aircraft but the aircraft continued to move until the No.1 engine collided with a tug which was parked in the equipment area, approximately 36 meters beyond the A300 position mark. An inspection identified that the yellow hydraulic system high-pressure filter housing, located in the lower fuselage, had fractured and leaked hydraulic fluid. Causes The Air Accident Investigation Sector of the United Arab Emirates determines that the causes of the Aircraft collision with a parking tow tug and the consequent substantial damage were: (a) The uncontrolled movement of the Aircraft by engine idle thrust beyond the parking stop line. (b) The Aircraft could not be maintained at rest after the initial stop because the selected parking brake was not operational due to a leak from a fracture in the yellow hydraulic system high-pressure filter head, and a failure of the accumulator system of the parking brake that could not be determined during the Investigation. (c) The Aircraft could not be stopped by manual braking because that the ÂManualÂ brake was disabled after the flight crew selected the ÂParkingÂ brake without prior confirmation that adequate parking pressure was available. 3.4 Contributing Factors to the Accident The Investigation identified that the following were contributing factors to the Accident: (a) Airbus had identified the design of the high-pressure filter head as one of two contributors to fractures developing at the head flange, but did not address this issue with equal priority. (b) The marshaller was not prepared to place wheel chocks on the AircraftÂs arrival at the parking bay and was therefore unable to react timely to obstruct the movement of the Aircraft.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: GCAA Report number: AIFN/0006/2020 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 4 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) GCAA UAE; Sharjah Airport (SHJ); 28 February 2020 photo (c) GCAA UAE; Sharjah Airport (SHJ); 28 February 2020 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

After accomplishing air work, the pilots returned to the airport to practice landings and takeoffs. According to both pilots, the first approach was normal, and the airplane touched down slightly right of the runway centerline. The trainee pilot stated that, after touchdown, the airplane began drifting further right and that he was unable to correct the deviation. The trainer pilot reported that, when directional control became unstable, he told the trainee, ""I have the controls."" The trainer pilot saw that the trainee pilot released his hands from the engine power levers and the yoke, but the airplane continued to deviate to the right, contrary to his control inputs and his addition of asymmetric power to the engines. The trainer pilot realized that, based on his inputs, the airplane should have returned to the centerline but that it did not and that it was behaving as if the trainee pilot was applying some braking. At that point, the trainer pilot again told the trainee pilot to release the controls, and he used the brakes, which he reported applied and released normally. Subsequently, the airplane exited the right side of the runway and impacted a ditch. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the right wing. The trainer pilot and the operator reported that there were no mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation. The trainer pilot reported that he believed the trainee pilot's feet were either on the brakes or interfered with his brake and/or rudder application attempts. The trainee pilot reported that he could not recall the position of his feet after he relinquished airplane control to the trainer pilot. Probable Cause: The trainee pilot's loss of directional control during landing and his subsequent unintentional control interference with the brakes and/or rudder during the trainer pilot's attempted remedial action, which resulted in a runway excursion and collision with a ditch.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: WPR20CA112 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 5 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: History of this aircraft Other occurrences involving this aircraft ï»¿  25 May 1999 N72GC Era Aviation 0 Anchorage, AK sub Bird strike Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

Eisenhower National Airport (ICT/KICT) to Hays Municipal Airport (HYS/KHYS) crashed in wheat field terrain northwest of La Crosse, Rush County, Kansas. The aircraft took off from ICT at 07:52 local time (12:52 UTC). At 08:25, the HYS automated weather observation service was reporting, in part, winds from 080Â° at 11 knots, visibility 1 statute mile, and overcast clouds at 200 ft above ground level.  The pilot made an ILS approach to runway 34 but was forced to execute a missed approach. The pilot stated to ATC his intention to attempt the ILS approach to runway 34 a second time. At 08:41, the HYS weather indicated that visibility had dropped to 0,25 statute mile in fog. Again, the pilot performed a missed approach. About 08:59 the pilot stated his intention to divert to Great Bend Airport (GBD), Kansas. The airplane began a turn to the south toward GBD while climbing to about 7,000 ft.  Around 09:06, the pilot began making unintelligible radio communications that air traffic controllers stated were unreadable. About 09:15, the controller asked the accident pilot if he was turning directly to GBD. After an unintelligible response from the pilot, the controller stated Âalright plane master sixteen seventy it's very difficult to understand there might be something wrong with uh your cockpit or your pressurization plane master sixteen seventy oxygen oxygen.Â About a minute later, the pilot was more easily understood. However, about 09:18, ATC made a transmission with no response from the pilot. At the same time the airplane began a descent and left turn.  About 09:20, an unintelligible response was received from the accident airplane. ATC then made numerous transmissions to the accident pilot urging him to utilize oxygen and open a window. No further communications were received from the accident airplane. The aircraft was found to have crashed in a field.

There were four persons on board; one pilot and three passengers. There were no reported injuries. During final approach into the Yenkisa Airstrip, the pilot was affected by the visual illusion presented by the upslope strip. As a result, the pilot flew too low during the final approach. The pilot stated that during the approach, as the aircraft got closer to strip 31, he realised that he was coming too close to a protruding tree along the approach path and determined that he was too low. He immediately shallowed the descent angle. Subsequent to clearing the tree, the pilot found himself high on approach, passing the strip 31 edge. The pilot steepened the descent angle because he realized that he had overshot the strip 31 edge. During flare, the aircraft floated for some distance due to the excess energy from the steep descent. The aircraft touched down about 200 m beyond the edge of strip 31. During the initial part of the landing roll, because the strip was wet, the aircraft subsequently skid forward. The pilot did not use reverse thrust during the landing roll. The aircraft overran the airstrip, hit a mound of clay and rocks, subsequently tipping left into a gully. The Yenkisa Airstrip is located at an elevation of 3700 ft. Airstrip 13/31 has a Landing Distance Available of 465 m. Landings can only be performed on runway 31 because the runway has a 8.7% down slope to the south-east. CAUSES [CONTRIBUTING FACTORS] There were trees protruding the approach OLS into Yenkisa Airstrip, close to the edge of strip 31. No effective action had been taken before the accident, to cut the trees protruding the approach OLS for Yenkisa Airstrip, following the survey conducted by RAA in which the obstacles were identified. At the time of the accident, the pilot did not properly manage the aircraft during the final approach and landing roll. During the final approach, the pilot was affected by a visual illusion due to the 8.7% upslope of Yenkisa Airstrip. The presence of trees penetrating the approach OLS was identified by the pilot after passing the committal point defined by MAF. The pilot was focused in clearing the obstacle, losing the aiming point. The final approach was not stabilised. During the flare, the aircraft travelled further than the expected touchdown point. During landing, main landing gear wheels were most likely locked causing the aircraft to skid. The pilot decided not to use reverse thrust during landingAccident investigation:   Investigating agency: AIC PNG Report number: AIC 20 - 1004 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 11 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources: MAF PNG   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates14-Feb-2025 10:24 ASN Updated The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

There were no injuries to the 127 passengers and crew, and the airplane was substantially damaged. According to the flight crew, the flight was cleared for a visual approach. The flight crew reported that the winds were from 040 degrees at 8 knots (slight tailwind), visibility greater than ten miles, and a thin layer of broken clouds at 17,000 feet.  The captain conducted an approach briefing and the first officer conducted a Landing Distance Assessment to account for the slight tailwind. The first officer reported the approach was normal and stabilized, and they encountered a slight downdraft in the flare. The captain disconnected the autopilot at about 400 feet above the ground and the autothrottle at 200 feet. Flight data recorder data indicated that the pitch attitude was about 7 degrees at touchdown but, as the ground spoilers deployed, pitch attitude increased to 10.9 degrees. There was a 3 to 5 knot crosswind at touchdown.  Post-flight inspection of the airplane indicated the underside of the rear fuselage struck the runway, resulting in damage to the skin, frames, and aft pressure bulkhead. Probable Cause: The excessive pitch attitude at touchdown.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: DCA20CA095 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 2 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The crew flew a maximum effort (assault) landing at Ramstein Air Base and experienced a hard landing with a vertical acceleration load factor (g-load) exceedance value of 3.62 times the force of gravity (g) and a landing sink rate of 834 feet per minute exceeding the  aircraftÂs maximum allowable landing limits of 540 fpm and g-load of 2.0g. Immediately upon touchdown, the crew executed a go-around and coordinated with Air Traffic Control for a visual approach, full-stop landing. The aircraft landed safely at 17:37. The landing g-load exceedance resulted in significant damage to the center wing, both outer wings, left and right main landing gear assemblies, and engines, to include mounting structures. The estimated damages are $20,917,089. The crew of this mission was scheduled to fly in a formation of three C-130JÂs planning to conduct two training routes. The primary training objective for the local sortie was to complete the pilotÂs evaluation. The crew planned to takeoff early as a single-ship, conduct a maximum effort takeoff followed by a maximum effort landing using the painted landing zone marked on the runway as required for the evaluation, full-stop, and then rejoin the formation in order to complete the remainder of the evaluation requirements in the formation. Preflight, engine start, taxi and the Ramstein AB visual traffic pattern procedures were executed within good flying standards and were procedurally correct. The mishap occurred during the maximum effort landing. The Accident Investigation Board President found, by a preponderance of the evidence, the cause of this mishap was the pilot's early engine power reduction (power pull), beginning at 70 feet above ground level (AGL) and fully flight idle at 45 feet AGL. In addition, the board president found, by the preponderance of evidence, that the evaluated pilot and other pilotÂs failure to identify the excessive sink rate and their failure to arrest the excessive sink rate or go-around in a timely manner were substantially contributing factors that resulted in the aircraft exceeding the C-130J-30 g-load and sink rate landing limits.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: USAF AIB Report number: final report Status: Investigation completedDuration: 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) USAF AIB; Ramstein AFB (RMS); April 2020 photo (c) USAF AIB; Ramstein AFB (RMS); April 2020 Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates Corrections or additions? ...

The airline transport pilot, commercial copilot, and one passenger were not injured.  The pilot reported that he was conducting a takeoff on runway 27 with the intended destination of Caracas-SimÃ³n BolÃ­var International Airport, Venezuela. During the takeoff roll, at rotation speed, the airplane did not respond when the pilot pulled back on the control yoke. He tried to rotate again, and the airspeed was in excess of V1, about 130 knots. With no response, he performed a rejected takeoff with maximum braking and full reverse thrust. The airplane departed the end of runway 27, proceeded through the overrun, and into the grass beyond the runway. The airplane pivoted to the left and came to a stop in the grass, near the perimeter access road. The crew and passengers exited the airplane and were met by first responders. The nose and right main landing gear collapsed during the accident sequence and the airplane sustained substantial damage to the forward fuselage and right wing. Probable cause: The pilotÂs inadequate preflight planning, resulting in an attempted takeoff in excess of the airplaneÂs maximum allowable weight given itÂs configuration and the temperature.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: ERA20LA162 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 2 years 1 monthDownload report:  Final report Sources: CBS12  WSVN  prensaamerica.com   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

At 12:16, the aircraft departed Cambridge Bay Airport for Kugaaruk (CYBB). The first officer was the pilot flying. At 13:19, when the flight was about 80 nautical miles from CYBB at flight level 210, the flight crew called the CYBB community aerodrome radio station. The flight crew received the runway surface condition report and were informed that the winds were from 200Â° true, at 24 knots gusting to 33 knots. At 13:20, the community aerodrome radio station operator called the flight crew and relayed the CYBB 1300 weather observation, reporting that the horizontal visibility was 1/4 statute mile in light snow and blowing snow and that the vertical visibility was 400 feet. The flight crew noted that the visibility had decreased since their departure from Cambridge Bay but continued the approach. The reported wind would result in a 12-to 16-knot crosswind component from the left on runway 23. The captain took control at 13:27, at the start of the descent, and descent checks were carried out. The captain transferred control back to the first officer at the initial approach waypoint, DATLA, and briefed for a pilot-monitored area navigation (RNAV) approach to runway 23. From the intermediate approach waypoint to the missed approach waypoint the approach is flown on a track of 244Â°T, which is offset 15Â° from the runway heading of 229Â°T. When the runway is acquired visually at or before the minimum descent altitude (MDA), a left turn is required to align the aircraft with the runway heading. During the descent the flight crew activated the runway lights and the precision approach path indicator (PAPI) system via the aircraft radio control of airport lighting system (ARCAL). The captain set the flaps to the approach setting (40%), and the first officer flew the descent. When the captain then confirmed visual contact with the runway, snow was blowing across it at an angle from left to right. The runway itself was apparent as a black shape within the blowing snow; however, the runway lighting and PAPI were not observed. The captain set the flaps to the land setting (100%) and then, as part of the pilot-monitored approach procedure, assumed control of the aircraft as the pilot flying. The first officer looked up from the instruments and observed, through the blowing snow, the runway as well as the community aerodrome radio station and airport apron ahead and off to the left. The aircraft crossed the runway threshold at 100 knots indicated airspeed. As the captain flared the aircraft, the first officer warned the captain of snowbanks off to the right side of the runway. At 13:50, when the right main landing gear touched down, the aircraft veered to the right and departed the runway surface. The right wing contacted snowbanks and the aircraft turned approximately 90Â° to the right before colliding nose first with a high snowbank. Both crew members, who were not injured, exited through the cabin door. The aircraft was substantially damaged; however, the freight remained secure. The emergency locator transmitter (ELT) did not activate and there was no fire. Findings as to causes and contributing factors 1. Approaches to airports north of 60Â°N latitude are not restricted by ground visibility and, as a result, the flight crew continued the approach when the reported visibility was Â¼ statute mile, which is lower than the published advisory visibility of 1Â¾ statute miles for this approach. 2. The flight crew believed that the lack of an approach ban permitted a landing, and landed at Kugaaruk Airport even though the reported ground visibility was below the minimum aerodrome operating visibility. 3. The offset approach, the crosswind component from the left, and the moving-runway illusion created by the blowing snow, all contributed to the aircraftÂs alignment with the right side of the runway. 4. The aircraft touched down near the right edge of the runway and, when the right landing gear impacted the deeper snow along the runway edge, the aircraft veered to the right and departed the runway surface. 5. The snow depth adjacent to the runway was allowed to exceed the limits dictated by the airport operatorÂs Winter Maintenance Plan. Consequently, the aircraft sustained additional damage when it departed the runway surface.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: TSB Report number: A20C0037 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year Download report:  Final report Sources: CBC  TSB A20C0037   Location  Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.

The pilot sustained no injury.  The flight departed the Corpus Christi International Airport (CRP), Texas, at 20:04 with 631 lbs of cargo and a fuel load of 2,800 lbs. During the initial climb, the captain selected the landing gear handle to the UP position to retract the landing gear. The attempt was unsuccessful, and the captain attempted to cycle the landing gear handle once more yielding the same result. Following the second unsuccessful gear retraction, the captain elected to leave the landing gear handle in the DOWN position and continued to the San Antonio International Airport (SAT), Texas, where more services would be available if needed. The airplane climbed to 8,000 ft mean sea level and cruised below the maximum landing gear extended speed (VLE). As the captain began to prepare for arrival at SAT, he retrieved the arrival automatic terminal information service (ATIS). The ATIS was reporting gusting winds out of the north, clear skies, and runway 4 as the active arrival runway. The captain began the descent toward the airport and air traffic control cleared the airplane for the visual approach to runway 4. The pilot entered a dogleg right base and completed the before landing checklist noting three green lights and no red lights, which indicated the landing gear was down, locked, and safe for landing. The airplane touched down around the aiming point marker on runway 4. As the main landing gear touched down on the dry concrete, the left main landing gear collapsed, the red unsafe light in the landing gear handle illuminated, and was followed by an aural horn indicating the landing gear was now unlocked and unsafe for landing. Simultaneously, the airplane began to dip toward the left, causing the left wing tip to contact the runway. The impact on the airplane resulted in the airplane's momentum taking the airplane from the runway centerline off the runway and into the grass area several thousand ft from the runway 4 threshold. Once the airplane came to a complete stop, the captain shutdown all power to the airplane and exited through the main entry air stairs. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing. A postaccident damage assessment by the operator revealed that the left main landing gear brace was fractured. Probable Cause: The failure of the left main landing gear upper drag leg arm due to substandard mechanical properties, which resulted in a collapse of the landing gear upon landing.Accident investigation:   Investigating agency: NTSB Report number: CEN20LA175 Status: Investigation completedDuration: 1 year and 10 monthsDownload report:  Final report Sources:  Location  Images: photo (c) FAA; San Antonio International Airport, TX (SAT); 11 May 2020; (publicdomain) photo (c) FAA; San Antonio International Airport, TX (SAT); 11 May 2020; (publicdomain) Revision history:Date/timeContributorUpdates The Aviation Safety Network is an exclusive service provided by: Quick Links: ASN Home Send Correction / FeedbackFSF Home DisclaimerCopyright Contact Us Privacy PolicyPress / Media CONNECT WITH US: ©2025 Flight Safety Foundation 1920 Ballenger Av, 4th Fl.
