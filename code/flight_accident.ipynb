    "## Overview\n",
    "Our project analyzes historical flight accident data to determine trends in aviation safety and identify key factors contributing to accidents. We aim to assess whether the perceived increase in plane accidents this year is due to actual incidents or amplified media coverage. By uncovering patterns, we can help improve aviation safety and inform future risk mitigation strategies."

    "## Motivation\n",
    "### Why this topic?\n",
    "We selected this topic because there is a growing public perception that plane accidents have increased since end of the 2024. However, we are uncertain whether this perception is driven by an actual rise in incidents or by increased media attention. By exploring the underlying causes of flight accidents, we hope to provide data-driven insights that clarify trends in aviation safety and contribute to discussions on how to enhance airline security and risk management.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3 Key Questions and What We Hope to Learn\n",
    "1. What are the most common causes of flight accidents, and how have these causes changed over time?\n",
    "    * By analyzing historical data, we aim to determine whether certain factors (e.g., mechanical failure, weather conditions, human error) have become more or less frequent contributors to flight accidents. This could help identify emerging risks and areas for improvement in aviation safety.\n",
    "2. What are the most common factors contributing to flight accidents?\n",
    "    * By analyzing historical accident data, we aim to identify the leading causes, such as weather conditions, mechanical failures, human error, or operational inefficiencies.\n",
    "3. Is there a correlation between media coverage and public perception of aviation safety?\n",
    "    * We seek to understand whether heightened media reporting on aviation incidents correlates with increased public fear, regardless of actual accident trends."
